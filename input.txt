b'Sterling Archer.  Code name Duchess.  Hm.  Known from Berlin to Bangkok as the world\'s most dangerous spy.  So for us, this is How you say?   A good get.  But not so good for you, Mr.  Archer.  Because you have information that I want.  And this may be old clich but we have ways of making you talk.  What? Your little go cart battery?   Golf cart.    Whatever.    Would you pick an accent and stick with it?   Listen here Son of a bitch.    Now you did it.    What is the point of these simulations   Krenshaw\'s arousal? if you don\'t take them seriously? How can I? Between his lame accent and the go cart battery   Golf cart.    Shut up.  And speaking of lame, my code name Was chosen at random by the ISIS computer.  Random? It was your dog\'s name.  Oh, Duchess.  I loved her so much.  That it was creepy and pathetic? And if you were half as smart as she was She wasn\'t too smart to die from eating chocolate, was she? Exercise terminated.    All right, that\'s lunch then.    Agent performance unsatisfactory.  Oh, come on At worst, that was "needs improvement. "   Jesus, Archer.    What?   You think this is a game?   No, I think Jenga is a game.  What if I\'d been real KGB? I assume you\'d try to suck a promotion out of some Russian guy\'s cock.    Maybe I never get promoted   Never will.  because my mommy\'s not the boss.  And maybe you just got your face kicked off.  That is my foot in your face.  Smell the embarrass Ow, oh!

I\'m so hungry.  Just give me five minutes on my backhand then we\'ll see if there\'s a   Is that a dog? Is it a dog?   Oui, that is Abelard.  Oh, adorable.  Now get the hell out of here.  But you promised me breakfast.  You want breakfast? Try the diner.  You\'re obviously into Greek.  Get it? Thank you, Abelard.    It\'s a short list, Woodhouse.  Yes, sir.    Things we don\'t allow in.  What are they?   Dogs and your mother.    That\'s a very short list, isn\'t it?   Yes but you were quite insistent   What was I? that an exception be made.  No, no, no, because forget the dog rule, because this pug is amazing.  Watch this.  Abergard, go.  Do you not hear that? That\'s "Puttin\' on the Ritz," man.    I\'m always insistent, Woodhouse.    Yes, sir.    But I\'m not to be trusted, am I?   No, sir.  Stop.  Shut up.  I have to go.  But if I find one single dog hair when I get back I\'ll rub sand in your dead little eyes.  Very good, sir.    I also need you to go buy sand.    Yes, sir.  I don\'t know if they grade it but Coarse.  One entire whole week we\'ve been calling you.  Highly unprofessional.  Really? Because I find your sweatiness unprofessional.  So we have something in common.  Besides the fact that now both of our shirts reek of curry.    And when will you settle your account?   When will you buy some dress shields?   This is not a dress.    Are you serious? That\'s not a dress? Oh, God, with the curry again.  This shirt smells like Indira Gandhi\'s thong.    Hey, you wanna smell something?   Swear to God, Mr.  Archer I have H. R.  On speed dial.    Shut up.  Hey, Krieger, you gotta smell this.  Krieger? Huh.  You geeks wanna smell something?   Archer, get the hell out.    What is it with you people? Try to include people in your life and then you Lana.  Hey.  Hey, what does this smell like? Like the dysfunctional asshole I broke up with six months ago.  Oh, my God.  You\'re amazing.  You are amazing, sweet stuff.  Wanna do it again and put on some interracial porn? God, it\'s like my brain\'s that tree, and you\'re those little cookie elves.  Just a second.    No, baby, don\'t answer that.    I have to.  Sorry, it\'s Mother.    Mother, hey.  Just a second.    I cannot believe you.  No, turn it on.  I can do both.    What?   So don\'t speak to me, ever.  And while you\'re not ever speaking to me, jump up your own ass and die.  Oh, rea After all that H. R.  Mediation.  Really?   Yup.    After all the hard work Pam did.    Is that Archer?   Goddamn it.    Archer, hey.    Go away.    About your operations account   Not   Cyril, not now.    Yes, now.    Not a good time.    You\'ve got serious discrepancies in your account.    No, Cyril.  I\'m sure you wouldn\'t use operational funds for personal expenses.  Come on, 22 black.  Twenty two black.  Twenty two.  Black.  Ass.  Son of a bitch.  Heh.  Not you, giant African man.  I\'m sorry.  Can I offer you a drink? How about this expensive prostitute? That is a very serious implication, Cyril.  Well, so is embezzlement.  Yeah? Well, so is the fact that you, some crazy how, are screwing my ex.    Archer, please.  That\'s private.    Not calm enough? You all know about Cyril and Lana, right? Of course, because if Pam knows, then everybody knows because of Pam\'s huge mouth.  Right, Pam? H. R.  Mediations are supposed to be confidential, Pam, you manatee.    And as for you, Cyril, good day, sir.    Archer.  Hey, wait.  What about your account? Oh, I get it.  Classic misdirection.  No, don\'t.  You\'re so ugly when you cry.    Mr.  Archer.    I\'m fine.  Is she in or out eating a baby?   You stood me up again last night.    Last? Oh, yeah.  Oh, my.  What happened was Did you see Brian\'s Song? Same thing pretty much happened.  I helped a guy with cancer.  Look, I\'m really sorry, Carol, but I couldn\'t It\'s Cheryl.  I know, Ca Cheryl.  So to make it up to you   I\'m ready.  could you buzz me in? Ugh.  Is that all you have to say? Yes.  Now tell me again how No, not that part.  Go back.  Yes.  The pepper.  Oh, yes, God.  Oh, God.  Oh, goddamn it.  What the hell are you doing? What are you doing? L I\'m For your information, I\'ve just been reviewing your operations account.    No.  No.  No.    Yes.  Yes.    Yes.  Yes.    No.  No.  And it makes for fascinating reading.    No.    Let\'s see.  You turned in an expense report from Berlin where the German desk says you never checked in.    Oh, Berlin was   Ditto Buenos Aires.    Too busy to check in?   There was Yeah.  Already off to Monaco?   I\'m spying.    Or was it Mallorca? Oh.    Or Tunis?   Tunis kind of rings a bell.  ISIS isn\'t your own personal travel agency.  It doesn\'t exist just so you can jet off to Whore Island.  That\'s not a real place.  I have 50 agents who\'d literally kill to move up to your position.  If you don\'t square your operations account by Monday they won\'t need to.  Your position will be vacant.    Sterling.    Hm? Sorry.  I was picturing Whore Island.  Have I made myself clear? Are you? You\'re looking for the answer "yes"?   Yes.  Good.    Then, yes.  Then get out.  And for God\'s sake, take a shower.  Smells like a whorehouse in here.  Okay.  Your own fingers.    Hm?   Nothing.  Johnny Bench called.  So here\'s the thing.  I need to access my operations account and you\'re preventing that.  Now, we can do this easy or we can do it hard.  Your call.  No? Hard it is then.    Oh, God, sorry.  Goddamn it, Archer.    I forgot that Did I get you? What is wrong with you? Me? Nothing.  You, on the other hand, have a bullet inside you.    I see the foot\'s all better.    And I see you\'re still a hatchet face prick.    Do you see that sign?   Do you see that sign?   Well   That\'s why.  So we don\'t get ants.  Because when your co workers put food in the refrigerator that\'s a bond of trust, okay? And if you violate that trust, or the food, there\'s There\'s my favorite section head.  I am dealing with the break room problem.  Oh, good.  You caught the Oh, wait I had something for this.    The Pita Predator.    You know what? Sorry.  Let\'s just call it what it is.    Food rapist.    Not a pretty name, is it? Pam, if you want some food that\'s supposed to be cream filled I offer these delicious doughnuts.  Yeah?   In exchange for a favor.    A favor?   Yeah.  After how you treated me?   **** your dolphin, Pam.  Archer, she\'s down, all right?   Your ******* dolphin.  She\'s tapping out.    You.    I think she peed.  I had to get three stitches.  And I broke my watch.  And I\'m sorry for that.    Three   But I need your help, Pam, because I\'m um, conducting a mole hunt.    Aah.    Gasp you should because if you let me in the mainframe, I\'ll drop these doughnuts.  Then you can pretend they\'re marbles and you\'re a hungry, hungry hungry hippo.  Lana.  Hey, I know I\'m supposed to be up my own ass right now but   Oh, is that what you want? Yup.    Because that\'s how you get ants.  Yay.  Cyril, my favorite section head.    What do you want?   To apologize for my behavior.    Well   And also to   What are you doing?   Oh, just dicing veggies for dinner.    I always make Lana stir fry on Friday.    Neat.  Listen   Guess what we call it.    Stir Friday?   Wow, that\'s actually better.    Yup.  It\'s all yours.  So come let me in the mainframe.  Is this about your operations account?   No.  Cyril   Yeah? I\'m on a top secret mole hunt.  Oh, yeah, Pam mentioned that.    Wha? When?   Well, she called a minute ago.    You know how Pam loves to gossip.    Yeah.  I need rug marbles.  I know.    Come let me into the mainframe.    Okay.    I need to confirm this with your mother.    No.  No.  I mean, what? Cyril.    What if she is the mole? Think about it.    Your own mother.  Think what that would do to me if we had to kill her   Archer.  by stabbing her wrinkly neck with a knife?   Yeah.  I can\'t let you in there.  Can\'t or won\'t?   Either?   And after I gave you Stir Friday.    That is much better.    I know.    But if you wanna access the mainframe   What? I guess you\'d have to break in.  Break in to the ISIS mainframe.  Which is obviously ludicrous.  As is this baby corn.  What is that about? Archer? ISIS headquarters makes Fort Knox look like a gingerbread house.  Only two means of ingress.  The first, at street level.  Impenetrable after 6.  The second, through an access door on the roof.  Inexplicably unprotected.  But even if you zip lined across  reached the access door  and somehow made it into ISIS headquarters  you\'d still have to find the mainframe.  But, wait, it gets worse.  Inside, there are three countermeasure systems.  The first is pressure sensitive in the floor.  Even a mouse triggers it.  The second is sound sensitive.  Anything above a whisper sets it off.  And the third system is state of the art voice activation.  Cyril Figgis.  So, obviously, it would be a lot easier for me if you just disabled all that when you left work tonight somehow.    Ooh.  That would make me uncomfortable.    Yeah.  Oh, God, everything makes you uncomfortable.  Just the tip? Just the tip.  Just the tip.  How was I to know you\'re lactose intolerant? Because I kept screaming it.    Well, what?   And this I\'m just a secretary.    I don\'t have access to security whatevers.    What?   Then get them from Cyril.    How would I do that?   Seduce him or Pam, or both.    I can\'t do that.    Can\'t or won\'t?   Either.  That\'s how you wanna play it? Fine.    Are you gonna pay for your lunch?   Just the tip.  Actually, I don\'t have any cash.  Can you get it? Sorry.  I also need cab fare.  Oh, ugly duckling.  Bock, bock.  So thanks for nothing, Carol.  Now I have to break into ISIS headquarters in a $900 turtleneck.  And if it gets ruined I\'m gonna make you drink heavy cream, you Carol.  Wow, that was actually pretty easy.  Thanks, new turtleneck.  Oh, and thank you, duffel bag.  Jesus, what else could go wrong? Exactly.  You\'re not Archer.  That\'s what\'s so great about you.  And the fact your mother died in a fire.    What?   I said where are we on that stir fry? Agent Kane.  What? Yes, confirmed.  Confirmed a naughty nellie\'s breaking our after work phone rule.    Cyril, there\'s been a break in at ISIS.    What?   Think it\'s the mole?   God, you and Pam   Pam\'s all right.    Wow.  Okay.  I\'ve got to go.    But it\'s Stir Friday.    Hurray.    But if I\'m not here   Yeah.  Because after three months of whatever it is we\'re doing it\'s weird that you can\'t leave me alone in your apartment.    I know I have trust issues, all right?   But it\'s   It\'s Archer\'s fault I\'m like this.    Here we go.    All of those years of lying and cheating.    It\'s fine.  That thing with the mayonnaise.    How messed up he is about his mother.    Fine.  Do you know he called out her name once when we f? Fine!   And here we are.  All fine.    Cyril, come on, hon, please? Now who\'s a naughty nellie?   Hello? Hi, who\'s this? Cyril Figgis.  I\'m sorry.  Did you say Faggis?   Figgis.  Figgis.    Who is it? Better not be Pam.  Not Faggis?   Figgis.  I was very clear.  Hi, I\'m a huge fan of cock and my name is Cyril Figgis.  Holy shit.  Our security is atrocious.  Seriously, it\'s really bad.  Password.  Hm.  Password.  How about "guest"? No way.  It can\'t be.  Jesus Christ, that is just Baby Town frolics.  Okay, operations account.  Just how deep in the red am I? Out of my mind.  Oh, no.  How? How did I spend that much money? Yeah, I know it\'s sexy, Woodhouse.  That\'s why I bought 10.  Now arrange those by color.  These are all black.  Oh, are they? Or are five in a dark black and five in a slightly darker black? And now I\'m short a slightly darker black one.  So let\'s just put all my expenses into some pathetic idiot\'s account by the name of Oh, Krenshaw.    Oh.  Now that\'s not very nice.    Oh, God.  Hey, I was I was just talking about you.  And about how this isn\'t what it looks like.    A lot of that going around.    Yeah.  It\'s an epidemic.  For example, my real name is Kremenski.    Is that sound? Is that Jewish?   It\'s Russian.  Um   Russian Jewish?   I\'m the mole, idiot.  What? I made up the mole.  Yes, but you told Pam and now everyone is looking for a real mole.  God, do we hate Pam.    So I have to escape.    And irony.  Thanks for breaking into the mainframe for me.    Double irony.    I\'ll need 50,000 for travel expenses.    Fifty thousand?   From your account.    That\'s too much.    It\'s all last minute bookings for two.  Wha? Oh.  Because when I hand the notorious Duchess to the KGB I won\'t just get a promotion, I\'ll get my own dacha.    Too bad you\'ll never see it.    What the? Lana, Krenshaw\'s a mole.  And his name\'s not really Krenshaw, it\'s Kremenski.  Definitely Russian, possibly a Jew.  I don\'t know.  Thoughts? Yeah.  Shut up.  And you, drop it.    Or what?   No, no, no.  Do not wind her up.  That is a big gun, and she is baby crazy.    Baby crazy?   That\'s why I dumped her.    You little You sack of shit.    What? What? I dumped you because you\'re dragging around a 35 year old umbilical cord.  See? All you talk about is baby shit because you\'re baby crazy.    You wanna see crazy?   No, I\'ve seen that movie and spoiler alert, it ends with a closetful of my suits on fire.    I wish you\'d been wearing one.    Who would want to wear an on fire suit?   Cosplay enthusiasts.    What? Do you even hear how totally batshit insane you sound? I\'ll tell you what I hear.  Yeah, please keep talking.  So why are you sitting here in the car eating stir fry? Oh, it\'s Stir Friday.  And Lana said to.  Krenshaw?   Ms.  Archer?   What\'s this flap about a break in?   Mother, look out.  Krenshaw is a mole.  Oh, Pam\'s just full of crap as she is of carbohydrates.    Now Hey.    Not this time, you impossible bitch.  Also, you should all be nicer to Pam.    I am always nice to her.    To her face.    Why aren\'t you in the car?   Will somebody do something? What are you doing, you idiot? Shut up.  It\'s classic misdirection.  Looks like we\'ve got a Mexican standoff, Kremenski.  How is this a Mexican standoff?   Dumb ass.  I don\'t care if you shoot her.    I do.    But what if I shoot her, mama\'s boy? Sterling?   Yes.    Picture her dead in the gutter   Sterling.  and what your pathetic life will be like without old Mommy dearest.  Jesus Christ.  What is it?   He\'s got an erection.  What?   What the hell is wrong with you people? Nothing.  You, on the other hand Ow.  Ow.    An erection?   Ow.  Hey.  What\'s in there, buckles? The thought of me dead gives you an erection? No, just half of one.  The other half would have really missed you.  I mean, not   Oh.    Ugh.  Johnny Bench called.  Yep.  See here, Krenshaw just stole 50,000 from Archer\'s account.    Must have been doing it all along.    Apology accepted, ass douche.    What? Call him that again   Make me.  What?   Do you see this?   I just don\'t understand.    This is a hostile work environment.    I would have known if we had a mole.    How?   How what, dear?   How could you know if we had a mole?   Um Then I am taking hot pepper and slowly I am rubbing it around Goddamn it.  Hello? Darling?   Who was this?   Who are you, Comrade Question? And who are you, Comrade Questions?   Comrade?   Oh, shut up.  You and your erection.    And why are there doughnuts everywhere?   Lana did that.  Do you want ants? Because that\'s how you get ants.Malory Archer.  Ho.  You get more beautiful every time I see you.    Oh ho ho, Gussy.    Minx.  You\'ll be the death of me yet.  But if I die let it be with the name of this dusky jewel upon my lips.  Lord Feltchley, may I present Miss Lana Kane? Yes, you bloody well may.  So nice to, uh Wow.  Okay, that\'s kidskin you\'re slobbering on, so Okay.  Wouldn\'t want to offend that boyfriend of yours, eh, wot? No offense taken, Your Lordship.  Glad to hear it.  Whoever you are.  Cyril Figgis, ISIS Comptroller.    And also my   Boyfriend.    Person I\'m dating.    No, he isn\'t.    We date.    No, you don\'t.    Ha.    No, no, no.  Your man\'s a rakish chap.  Air of mystery, chiseled good looks?   Oh, I think maybe you mean my ex?   Oh.    Archer.    Archer, exactly just.  And if memory serves, not only handsome, but also A secret agent.  That\'s what I am.  And I shouldn\'t even be saying that but you have a certain thickness about you that I very find appealing I find your drunkenness very unappealing I am drunk or I wouldn\'t be talking to you.    So if you\'ll please excuse me.    Hey, come on.  Don\'t be like that.    Whoops.    Sterling, look out.  Feltchley, you dirty Sassenach.  Free Irishmen will never bow down before the English crown.  Oh l l, Sterling Archer.  That was totally ninja.  Yeah, if you\'re into that.  Hmm?   Lana?   Hon? Hello?   Huh? Hey.    What\'s up, buddy?   Ugh.  Nothing.  Oh, dear.  Good show, Archer.  Really saved my bacon there.  Hey, come on.  You know I\'d never let anything happen to your bacon.    I love you, Santa Claus.    What? I do.  Cyril, we\'ve got big problems.  Well, it may seem daunting now but in the long run the HSA makes a lot more sense than flex accounts.  I don\'t mean the health plan.  Unless it covers Wandering Eye Syndrome.  That depends on if that\'s a real thing.  Oh, it\'s very real.  And Lana has it.    Wait, what?   Cyril, I know you saw how she looked at Sterling last night.  Well, I think she was just shaken up Stirred up, Cyril.    In the loins.    You think her loins were stirring?   Lf not frothing.    Frothing? Great.  What should I do? We should make you into someone for whom Lana\'s loins get equally frothy.  And how exactly would we do that? She\'s obviously attracted to men of danger.    Like Archer.    Exactly.    The perfect field agent.    Who better to train you to become one? Archer train me? To be a field agent? He\'s already been briefed.  But only on the "what," mind you, not the "why. " No sense telling him it\'s about Lana   Boy, wait till I tell her.    No.  Cyril.  Under no circumstance is Lana to know about our little plan.    Right.  I think.  Oh.    But about plans: Health plan switchover?   Cyril.  I\'ll take care of whatever that is.  You just concentrate on your training.    And Archer\'s really okay with this?   Oh, not at all.  Which is just gravy.  No, I just let mother think that because I know what she\'s up to vis  vis Cyril and Lana and me.  And it\'s not broadening Cyril\'s horizons.  Trust me, Mother\'s idea of horizon broadening is a lot of fights walking home from a lot of jazz tap lessons.  I so enjoy our talks.  You got them? They\'re loaded and ready to go? Seriously, Krieger, you are my Oprah.  So obviously I\'m not happy about this whole arrangement, but But your mother is, so But I wonder what Lana thinks? Oh, Lana\'s not need to know on this.  Wow, "open purse, remove balls" huh? I\'m sure it\'s not the first time you kept a secret from Lana.  Uh Hello.  Herpes?   You gave Lana herpes? Ahem.    Hello, Cheryl.    It\'s Carol.  What? Since when? Since I had it legally changed because you always call me Carol.  Wow, that\'s   Excuse us.    Ugh.  Okay, now what is this herpes business? Sorry, bad joke.  And a false alarm.    Lesson one, get used to that.    Should I be writing this down? No.  Never leave a paper trail.  That\'s lesson one.    So ditch this.    Hey, that\'s Ow! Jesus.    My dead mom\'s pen.  Cyril did that.  This is what a real field agent uses.  Huh.  Point\'s a lot finer than I prefer.    That\'s because it\'s a hypodermic needle   What? and the cartridge is full of a deadly super toxin called Poizocaine.    Here.  Keep it in here.    Uh Hey, whoa.    Wait a minute.    But be careful.  The cap slips off for, like, no reason.  Beep, beep, beep.  Oh, you giving me the truck noise Karen Carpenter\'s stunt double?   I thought you were walking backwards.  It\'s all the HSA switchover crap.  I\'m so over that lame flex account.  When does the HSA start? When Cyril e files these DD 14s.    Oh, Ms.  Archer\'s taking care of those.    What? Cyril\'s off somewhere with Mr.  Archer.  I\'m sorry, Cyril\'s off what? With whom? I think "somewhere" was the "what" there.    "Mr.  Archer" was the "whom. "   Worlds collide, huh? Inevitable for a serial workplace dater.    Oh.  Yeah.  Call the kettle black.    Ugh.  Did she just race card me, or are you totally just gay for her? I\'m the Human Resources Director, Little Miss Hostile Work Environment.  She is riddled with herpes.  Hey.  Inappropriate workplace topic.  And also a dealbreaker.    Lesson one: Human intel   Oh, shoot.    I forgot about the DD 14s.    Screw them.  That\'s Mother\'s headache.  You tell me, does it look like I\'m allergic?   Jesus Jones, yes.    So when I asked for cucumber slices which one of you idiots sent up zucchini?   That, well, that would be   That would be Jane who did that.    Scatterbrain Jane?   I know, she\'s just a mess.    Because this is obviously zucchini.  Oh.  You\'d recognize a vegetable that wasn\'t wrapped in a Monte Cristo sandwich.  What\'s that supposed to mean? That is Pam, isn\'t it? Okay, so, human intelligence entails? Well, there\'s false flags, dead drops, drop outs, cut outs active doubles, passive doubles, dangled moles the often under appreciated honeypot?   Wow.    One of my favorites.    That sounds like a lot to cover.    Yeah, so we may have to gloss over almost all of it, but   Aah!   Weapon.  Oh.    Oh, hey hon.    Hey back.    Hello.    What\'s   What\'s this?   Well, see here\'s the thing Under no circumstance is Lana to know about our little  plan.    Here\'s what thing?   Okay.    Archer\'s DD 14.    Yeah.  That we\'re on our way down to clear up with Jane.    Really?   Well you know Scatterbrain Jane.  Heh heh.    You\'re cooking dinner later?   Yes, I am.    Yeah.    Yeah.  Speargun?   Oh.  I can\'t believe I just did that.    Yeah, dunce.  Now Jane\'s a loose end.  Hey, Jane.  You getting a snack? Keep your story vague.  That\'s lesson one.  But, I mean, morality aside, how do you keep track of all these lies? Practice, Cyril.  Lying is, like, 95 percent of what I do.    In your job.    Sure.  It was pretty cool how you handled that speargun.    Yeah, it was pretty cool.    Will I get to learn karate? Karate? The Dane Cook of martial arts?   No.  ISIS agents use Krav Maga.    Krav? We\'ve got an ex Mossad guy, he comes in Thursdays.    Neat.    Yeah.  Tuesdays he does a spin class.    So will I need sweatpants?   Cyril.  You need all new clothes.  What\'s wrong with these? Sorry.  Oh.  I was laughing at your clothes.  Wow, Archer, you were right.  A tailored suit hangs so much better.  That\'s because Woodhouse is a genius.  Like so many other geniuses, unappreciated in his life Shut up and hem, you old fruit.    Speaking of fruit, sir.    Oh, sorry.  Heh heh.    Cyril, check this out.  Watch yourself.    Really?   Don\'t make it weird.  It\'s your friend.    And so\'s this baby.  Jeezy Petes.  It\'s a Chekhov.  Russian made.    . 25 caliber.    When would you use an underwear gun? Hopefully never.  But say you\'re in a Caribbean bungalow and you\'re kind of high.  An exotic woman on the bed now is she just the high priced whore you asked for?   Or is she an assassin?   I don\'t know.  I Here\'s room service.  Who ordered champagne? How should I know.  Exactly.  You\'re baked, can\'t remember.  Since when does it take three huge, surly Jamaican guys to deliver one bottle of champagne? Oh.    Because they\'re assassins too.    Or Maybe one guy\'s a new waiter, the second one\'s training him and the third\'s from maintenance, finally off his lazy ass to fix the AC.  Oh.  Yeah, I guess that could happen.  Point is, you come out of the john waving this around nobody\'s gonna bug you for a tip.  Here.    It\'s a gift.    Thanks, wow, that\'s slippery.  And the safety\'s off so be careful, it could go off for, like no reason.  Now what\'re these pills? Oh, just antihistamines mostly.  You just rest, Ms.  Archer.  We\'ll take care of these DD 14s for you.  Damn right you will.  Idiot.  Pam, look at this.    Holy shitsnacks.    We have snacks? Everybody\'s personal medical records.    No, we can\'t be looking at this.  Are there snacks? It\'s totally confidential.  It totally should be.  Look at this.    Oh, my God.    Yeah.  Cyril tried to get his plan to cover a penis ensmallment?   Who\'d have thunk it?   I bet Agent Kane thunks it plenty.    You bet she does what?   Oh! I bet she, uh Oh.    I got nothing.    That\'s what I thought.    You seen Cyril? Is that Lana? Wow.  What happened to you? Scatterbrain Jane, but let me just tell you, okay? You should be thankful you have Cyril.    Well   For about 12 reasons.  Well, thank you, Malory.  But if you don\'t mind, I\'d prefer to keep my personal affairs out of the office.    Oh, please.  She\'s had more pens in that company ink than a pen store.  And yet does not have herpes.    Dealunbreaker.    Ugh.  What\'s the matter, baby? Afraid you\'ll catch something? No, it\'s not that.  I\'ve just never been this close to a Call girl.  It\'s not an insult, Cyril.  Trinette takes pride in her work.    I really do.    Okay.    So come on budge in.    Uhn.    Gosh, yeah.    Now that\'s not so bad, is it?   Ha ha ha.    No.  That feels pretty good.    I can tell.  You are gifted.    Okay.    God, it\'s just his gun, Trinette.  Sorry.  Bet this seems pretty weird.  Oh, please.  The sick shit I\'ve done in this apartment?   Okay.    And that wasn\'t all gun, neither.  Ha ha.  No, ma\'am.  Hey, can you two focus? Please? Woodhouse.  Are you ready, or what? Yes, quite ready sir.  Though not entirely willing.    Yeah, and I don\'t know if I am, either   Could have fooled me.  Hey.    Oh, Trinette.  It\'s perfectly safe.  You\'re tangoing then your trained field agent eyes spot two threats.  But they\'re not trained.  We haven\'t done this yet.  This is how you train them.  So.    You spot your first threat.  Woodhouse.    Ooh.  Hoo.    My knees aren\'t   Bam, bam, bam.  You put him down.  But just shoot the pad, not Woodhouse.    Like, actually shoot the gun? Then.  How else are you gonna learn? Okay, he\'s down just the pad.  Then you see the second threat.  Oh, no, you\'re out of ammo.  What are you gonna do? Oh, that\'s where the turn comes in? Duh.  Woodhouse.  Get in position.  I really need a better health plan.  Shut up.  Weapon is hot and live fire exercise in five, six, seven, eight.  Tango, tango, tango.  Scan the ballroom of the Cuban embassy for the agent you\'re supposed to meet.  You\'re just some Canadian dude down here on business and threat.  Woodhouse.    Yes.    Cyril.  Shoot.    Oh, oh.    Aah!   Shoot, bitch.  Democracy\'s at stake.    Oh! Take that, forces of evil.    Heh.  Ooh.    Whoa.    Way to go, baby.  You hit it.  Yeah.  I did, didn\'t I?   Second threat.    Oh.  Right, I forgot about   Second threat.  Jesus.    Ow! Christ on sale.  Jesus.  Yeah, Cyril.  That was totally ninja.  No, Archer.  That was totally uncool.  Sorry, Trinette, did that hurt? Yeah, it fricking hurt, idiot.  It\'s ice.    Okay, we\'ll use grapes.    We\'ve only lingonberries, sir.  Ballistically similar to grapes? Screw your grapes and screw your whatever berries, I am out of here.    No, wait.  Trinette, please, l   Spying ass bastards.    Please my fat Irish ass.  Ow!   Ooh.  What the hell\'s in your freaking pocket? Um   Ha.    Oh.  Oh.  I don\'t feel so good.  Me neither.  And voicemail again.  Huh.  So, it\'s me.  Duh.  And did you say you\'d cook, or did I mishear that? I know I misheard you about Jane, because turns out, I ran into her.  Hey, Jane.  You getting a tampon? Yeah.  Loose end.  But I\'m sure you had a good reason to lie to me so can\'t wait to hear what it was.    Oh, my God, you killed a hooker.    Call girl.    She was a   No, Cyril.  When they\'re dead they\'re just hookers.  God, I said the cap slips off the poison pen for no reason.  I know, but I just assumed that if anything bad happened No.  Do not say the Chekhov gun, Cyril.  That, sir, is a facile argument.  And also woefully esoteric.    Woodhouse.    Fetching a rug, sir.  Now he\'s fetching a rug.  Happy, Cyril? No.  No, I\'m not happy.  Well, guess what.  Me neither.  I mean, big picture, I wouldn\'t say I\'m a happy person.  Sir.  I have fetched the rug.  Plus now I\'m out a rug.  Oh, God.  I should never have agreed to this.  You and your stupid mother and her stupid frothing loins.  Hey.  I know you\'re upset, but if you ever mention my mother\'s loins or their frothiness, to me again I don\'t know what I\'ll do, but it will be bad.  Now let\'s go bury this dead hooker.  Shirt tails.  We need a password.    Hang on a second.  Ha ha ha.  How you doing, Ms.  Archer? I am good.    Okay, try Okay, try "guest. " Real good.  Well, that\'s just idi Oh, my God.  I know, right? So here let\'s make the co pay zero, and the deductible   Super high, right?   No, low.  You want the lowest deductible.  But don\'t you deduct it on your taxes or something?   Wow.    So you want more? And people think Jane\'s stupid.  Speaking of, it\'s probably better if Jane was the last one to log in.  You are a bitch.  I am not.  What? Because I don\'t want Sterling to end up with a woman like Lana Kane? My God, a black ops field agent? Thought she was going in a whole other direction with that.  Because let me tell you, I was black ops.  And that does not for a young boy a very merry Christmas make.  Ajax a success, Teheran is ours, stop.  Merry X mas from Mommy and Uncle Kermit, stop.  Also, be nicer to Woodhouse, stop.    You made up the last part, didn\'t you?   I did, sir.  Douche.    Oh, my God.    I know, right? This is the most kickass health plan ever.  And I think I just had a flashback, so these antihistamines are insane.  Oh, I\'m crazy? Cyril, you\'re the one who killed a perfectly good hooker.  By accident.  We could explain.  To who, Cyril? The cops? Lana? She\'d never forgive me.  Archer, my life is ruined.  And all because Mother cooked up this stupid plan   But I just to make you an agent just to impress Lana.  Ironic, isn\'t it? I\'m not sure that\'s technically irony.  What? This is like O.  Henry and Alanis Morissette had a baby and named it this exact situation.    No, it\'s   Yes, it is.  Because a man like you, Cyril, doesn\'t deserve a woman like Lana.  You You butthole.  You set this all up, just to drive me and Lana apart.    Well?   Screw you, Archer.  Hey.  Hostile work environment.  Exactly.  And I\'m gonna file a hostile work environment lawsuit against you, and your mother, and ISIS, and What? Who the hell is that?   Your confederates in Operation Butthole.    Cyril.    Those aren\'t my confederates.    Well, nice try but Cyril Figgis ain\'t buying it.    You hear that? I ain\'t buying it.    Cyril.  Oh, my God.  How about now, Cyril? Are you feeling ready to buy? To Scatterbrain Jane.  And to plan covered elective surgery.  And the boob job.  That you so need.  And the ass reduction you so need.  And the skinny bitch ectomy you need.    Oh, my God, did you hear that?   What do you think it is? Immigrants.  That\'s how they do, you know? Just drive around, listening to raps and shooting all the jobs.    Then who are those guys?   How should I know? KGB, the Stasi, Shining Path, this guy I know named Popeye? I have enemies, okay?   That\'s because no one likes you.    What? Seriously, do you not sense that? I am a product of my upbringing, Cyril.  Well, I was a single mother.  And it\'s a big dangerous world out there.  Are you idiots still even here? So why aren\'t you better at this? I am the best at this, Rain Man, okay? I\'m like Who? James Bond? Well, I don\'t like to invite that comparison.    But yeah, basically.    So do something.  I\'m doing all kinds of stuff, Cyril.  I\'m shooting the gun, see?   I\'m driving the car.    I could drive better than that.  So knock yourself out.  I\'m ejecting.    No, you are not.    Yes, I am totally am.    Stop it.  No.    No.    Grenades in the glove box.    Drive me and the hooker to safety or Excuse me.    Lana? Yeah, I\'m looking for two guys.  They\'re on their way to the morgue?   Great.    Archer, what am I gonna tell her? Well, if you learned anything today, it won\'t be the truth.  I don\'t care if you have you lied to me.  Did not learn anything.    Well, you shot a machine gun at me.    Around you.    Because my feelings were hurt.    Well Why on earth would you lie to me? I just wanted to show you I could be a supercool ISIS field agent like Archer, but But baby, don\'t you know I like you so much because you\'re exactly the opposite of Archer?   Well, yeah, but   Not to mention your other qualities.  Oh, you are such a naughty Nelly.    He just gets a pass? Like Milton Berle? Yep.  Hey, so how did you know where I was? When we first started going out I may have injected a tracking device into your body.  In my body? No, no.  Now, that is a breach of trust, Lana.  Do you really wanna open this can of trust breachy worms right after I caught you and my ex boyfriend with a hooker in the trunk?   I do not.    You do not.  Oh, and Archer, how\'s this for ironic? You know what? I don\'t have a "one to some other number of douchebags" scale.  So, six? Oh, my God, Trinette.  Yeah, Trinette, you shitass.    So you know you have to be punished.    Yes.  You\'re gonna walk into our video store With the sweet old Korean lady.    And buy the nastiest, barebackinest, hard dickinest, ball splapiest interracial porno in there.  From the sweet old Korean lady? Yep.  How you feel about that?   Like I got off pretty easy.    Night ain\'t over yet.    Throw me in a trunk?   Not part of the plan.  Inject me with some crazy spy poison?   It was just a harmless tranquilizer.    You shitass.  I mean, let\'s be honest, I doubt that\'s the first needle you ever   Ow!   I never.  Give me your wallet.  I already paid you.  File a customer service complaint.  I\'m sure Popeye\'d love to hear it.  Hey, come on, you wouldn\'t tell Popeye.  Oh, watch me.    Oh.  Give me your watch.    You know how much this thing costs? Probably less than a new set of kneecaps.    There.  Happy?   Almost.  You know, I bet there\'s a lesson to be learned from all this.  But l Oh, shit, my rug.And if it happens again I\'ll put a lock on it so no one can enjoy it.  Moving on, item seven.  Oh, I\'m afraid I have some tragic news.    Um, item six wasn\'t tragic? Zip it.    Wow.    Agent Hector Ruz who had infiltrated El Frente Rojo was killed last night when his cover was blown.    My little burrito.    Wait, who? How in the world did his cover get blown? Ruz? Hey man, talk to these chicks, all right? Tell them how we\'re really ISIS agents! They don\'t believe me.  Hello? Seor Wingman?   He probably got careless.    I\'m sure Hector didn\'t get Oh, come on.  Ruz was a loose cannon.  He played fast and he played loose.  And in the end, he got burned.    Be that as it may!   Loose cannon.  For ISIS to continue enjoying Title 6 tax incentives we have to meet certain diversity requirements.    Oh, I think we\'re pretty diverse.    Ha.  Please.  What? You\'re blackish.    Ish?   Well, what\'s the word for it, Lana?   You freaked out when I said "quadroon. "   Imagine that!   You imagine it!   Both of you, imagine shutting up! Because after losing Agent Pak last year Hey, tell this broad what\'s up with ISIS, Pak man.  Wokka, wokka, wokka! and then Agent Mgumbe You going to this lame ISIS picnic?   Loose cannons! the ISIS palette has become decidedly monochromatic.    I\'m one sixty fourth Cherokee.    Shut up!   So stupid.    What?   A, no, you\'re probably not.    And B through Z, nobody gives a shit.    Racist!   What? You\'re anti Native American.    Jeez!   Come on.  Item eight.  We need a diversity hire.    I vote Asian chick.    And after an exhaustive search I found the perfect candidate.  So join me in welcoming our new ISIS agent Stern.  Conway Stern.  He\'s a diversity double whammy.  So that was the firing range and the cafeteria, and   Do you keep kosher?   Well, I do have a weakness for prawns.  Me too! I\'ll have them make paella tomorrow.  Okay, that\'s the mainframe, and these are all just drones.    Hey, come on! Malory, these are the unsung heroes of ISIS.  Where\'d we be without my man Cyril in accounting? Hey, thanks, bro.  You got it, buddy.  Or the lovely Pam in Human Resources.  Yeah, I am kind of lovely.  And last but not least I\'m sorry, I don\'t know your name.    Me neither.    See? They don\'t know anything.    Now, over here is a big corner office.  I see it\'s currently empty.  Like my "vagine. " Yeah, but unlike your dusty "vagine," it\'s not going to stay empty.  Wait, you don\'t think you\'re getting the office.  Well, I am the Human Resources director.  Pam, come on, let\'s face it.  Your entire job could be done by a   A bulletin board.    You heard Conway.  I\'m essential! How? I can go online and get a list of every federal holiday for the next   Wow, ten thousand years.    Wait, really? Ten thousand? Hmm? Oh.  No, this isn\'t even on.    I\'m gonna get that office! I\'m getting it, Pam! Oh, my God, I am surrounded by idiots.  And this is the locker room.  Yeah, the, uh, lockers were a tip off.  Well, I\'ll leave you to it.  But if you need anything you know how to whistle, don\'t you, Conway?   Yup, lips together, blow.  Got it.    Oh.  Ha, ha.  You are just a little treasure.  Jesus, Conway.    What have you got yourself into, man?   You better pray it wasn\'t my mother.  I\'m fairly confident you misread that whole situation.    Oh, yeah?   I\'m real confident you misread this one.  Uh, how about this one?   This one, uh actually seems kind of gay.    Maybe because our penises are touching.  Yeah, so, let\'s go on Three!   What? You, uh, see something you like?   Wha? No, you queer! Oh, I\'m queer? From the guy whose tiny gun came with a matching purse? Hey, it\'s got plenty of stopping power.  What? That little?   Goddamn it, Archer! Again!   Oh, shit.  See that? He was putting on his pants and I stopped him.  So you just watch your step, mister, uh   Damn it.    There, should have gone with:   "Sammy Gay vis Junior. " Damn it! Come on.  She doesn\'t need a corner office just to Xerox the ISIS newsletter.    Color Xerox.  And what, you need more room to chop vegetables? All right! Obviously, I need to make a decision.  But which shall it? Oh! Or I could just give Conway both!   You what?   I already took care of those.  Frodo and Salsa were my operations.  At ease, Career Admiral, Malory was getting impatient on Salsa.    Salsa was a highly complex operation.    Two phone calls.    And as for Frodo Wha? Well, some pun involving hobbits.  Like, I bet he wishes he was wearing Bilbo\'s coat of Dwarven mithril.    Gonna take your word on that.    Yeah? Well, take my word on this.  I am the top agent around here.    So watch it!   So, see, in Middle earth Shh.  Shh, shh, shh.  Come on, buddy.    You\'re kidding.    No, I\'m dead serious.  I wanna file a complaint against Conway.    On what grounds?   He touched my penis with his penis.    Wow.    Yeah.  He just came up to me and was like: "Byoop!"   Where?   All of it.  Head and shaft.    And Oh, you mean where in the building.    No.    That shouldn\'t matter, Pam.    I got this other complaint from Brett who said you shot him again.    Uh here\'s the thing about Brett.  Oh, shit! Those were the newsletters! Cyril, I need a little favor.  Okay, Carin Oh.    Now it\'s Cristal? Cristal.  You know? Like the champagne.  It\'s what hot black guys drink.    Uh, you sure about that?   And I want Conway to drink me so I need you to hook a sister up.    Well, I will certainly try.  Don\'t try, do.  And here, use this.  Wow, what is this? Tell Conway that his Secret Santa wants to come early.  Or, you know, whoever brings Jewish people their Christmas presents.  What are you doing?   Uh, none of your businessing.  What kind of spy agency scrimps on a freaking shredder? Apparently the kind that scrimps on background checks.    Who is this guy?   I don\'t know.  But I got a bad feeling about Mother\'s little "Project Conway. " So I must be having a stroke because we actually agree on something.    Wait, really? Totally.  I mean, he shows up out of nowhere and starts trying to get all up in everything? I mean, Salsa, Frodo.    Possibly Mother.    And what do we even know about him?   Only that he\'s not circumcised.    Okay.    Glossing over how you know that   We touched penises.  No! Glossing.  But a non circumcised Jewish guy, that\'s not weird to you? No, why would? I mean, I\'m not Jewish and I\'m circumcised.  So it can   It doesn\'t work like that.  Lana, come on.  I think we both know it works fine.  Oh, come on.  Not your dick, dumbass.  Oh, my God! This is about you and me, right?   Oh, my God! Get over yourself!   Hey, I am over me.  But apparently you\'re not.    What the hell smells like shrimp?   Just my sensual womanhood.  Oh, wait.  Ew.  I bet your womanhood smells divine.    Conway!   Now, whom can I thank for these shrimps? Me, your secret Jew Santa.  Conway! That was amazing.  Yes, so, uh okay.    Oh, my God, I hope I\'m pregnant.    What are you talking about? The system bounced your sexual harassment complaint against Conway.    Well, unbounce it back.    Who am I, Tron? Talk to your mother, she bounced it.    Why?   Hey.  Whoa.    Why would she do that?   Don\'t go starting rumors about Conway boning your mother.    Oh, my   You get any of that in the trash can?   No.  I, uh, missed it on purpose.    Hey, Malory, uh, you got a second?   I sincerely doubt it.    It\'s about Conway.    Then yes, I have entire minutes.  Isn\'t he just a dream come true? Well, that\'s the thing.  How did you actually find Conway? Well, he just sort of appeared.    Uh, yes, okay.    Like a foundling, carved out of onyx.  Yes, but from where? I mean, if you didn\'t do a background check Are you an idiot? Or do you just think I am?   He totally checked out.    Okay, so do you mind if I take a little? Lana Kane! Just because now you\'re not the only black agent   Hey, that is not   Urban.  Whatever.  You come in here and accuse Conway of what, exactly? Okay, fine, I can\'t prove anything right now.  But that never stopped J.  Edna Hoover from persecuting Martin Luther King now, did it?   What does that have to do? Wait, J.  Edna? You never heard that? How Hoover was this huge, cross dressing chicken hawk?   I had not.    That\'s exactly the kind of slanderous and unsubstantiated rumor I will not tolerate at ISIS.    Think about that while on suspension.    While I\'m on what?   What are you, deaf and racist?   Wha?   I\'m black.    Oh, put it back in the deck.    Hey, how is my lovely lady.    Suspended.    What?   Malory suspended me.  Just because I had the nerve to ask questions about her little homeboy McJewerson.    Whoa, Lana, honey.    What?   Even though it\'s perfectly natural for you to be jealous of Conway Then she cold cocked you, huh?   Yeah, with that big Flintstoney fist of hers.    Seriously, "Homeboy McJewerson"?   Oh, come on, I\'ve heard worse than that.  Yeah, but it doesn\'t even make sense.    I mean, maybe if you were Scottish or   Hey, man, racism, anti Semitism.  You can\'t go looking for logic in it.  Here, this\'ll help the swelling.  Oh, thank you.  Ha, ha.  Where\'d you get the steak? Cristal.  Yet another offering of unrefrigerated meat and/or seafood.    Yeah, she\'s kind of weird that way.    She\'s kind of weird a bunch of ways.  What you doing, Birdbones?   Looking for a pregnancy test online.    But there\'s a drugstore half a Oh.  You mean that you take online.    Yeah I want to know like, now.    Well, thank God for them internets.    Okay, what is this lame meeting about?   No idea, I\'m busy and go away.    Excuse me?   Oh, my God, why are you still here?   Mother called me for a meeting.    But I thought you called a meeting.  Oh, and by the way, you don\'t call a meeting, only I call a meeting.  I called the meeting.    Which I love.  That you did that.  I know it\'s not standard procedure but we\'ve got a problem.    A problem or a blessing? A problem.  It\'s a silent submarine propulsion system, called the Whisper Drive.    Oh, sounds sexy.    Would you stop it.    Folks, please.    Embarrassing.    You are embarrassing.    Jesus.  This is Wilhelm Schmeck, inventor of the Whisper Drive.  Schmeck went missing along with the plans for the Whisper Drive.  I tracked him to South Beach.  He\'s arranged to sell the plans to Cuban Naval Intelligence.  If that happens undetectable Cuban missile subs could be parked right off Miami Beach.  Ugh.  Just what Miami needs.  More Cubans.  And all we need is a stand in, who resembles Schmeck\'s Cuban contact Wha? What? That looks nothing like me.    Well, he\'s just a lot more handsome.    Whatever.  Zip it! Conway, dear?   The plan?   Using Archer as bait we slip in just ahead of the real Cubans, capture Schmeck, and recover the plans.  If we could run this thing through your condo, that   You have a South Beach condo?   I, uh Oh, hey, how\'s the, uh, lemon tree doing? RaI says it already has tiny lemons.  That was a wonderful thank you gift.    Well, it was a wonderful weekend.    It was, wasn\'t it? You were there, in the condo, together?   Yeah, last weekend.  Oh, my God.  Oh, for See? That\'s what happens when you drink all day and skip lunch.  Oh, we were supposed to have paella.  Archer, come on, man, let\'s go.  You go! Get on the plane, buckle in, sit there and think about how you\'re not the boss of me.  Hey, babe.  Got any extra puke bags? Why? You taking a moral inventory? Jesus, God, what are you doing here?   I\'m, trying to save   A relationship? Lana, maybe when I get back, we can work out some kind of bang buddy deal, but Ow!   I want you to listen to me.    Well then unperforate my eardrum.  Un head up your ass! I think Conway is totally up to something.  Duh! You think I\'m an idiot? I know he wants to marry Mother and cut me out of the will.    Ugh.  Archer.    Which is why I\'m going to kill him.    Oh.  Okay, well, whatever the reason.  It\'s not because of the whole black stepfather thing.    You know me better than that.    Yeah, I do.  So try not to do anything stupid, okay? Conway could be dangerous.  Yeah.  You know what\'s dangerous?   Your obsession with me.    Just Seriously Lana, call Kenny Loggins because you\'re in the Danger Zone.    From Top Gun.    Just be careful.  No.  God, this is so classic Mother.  Yeah, it\'s pretty tastefully done, huh? No, you ass.  The selfishness.  She never shares anything with anybody.  You\'re keeping that office for you? I need it to escape the glare from those windows across the street.  From the? There\'s no glare.  Well, not now.  But mid April? Every morning.  For almost 20 minutes.  So you\'re gonna keep that huge corner office empty the other   Ninety gazillion percent of the time.    Just because the glare is annoying? Well, semi annoying.  Okay, you\'re meeting Schmeck at that caf across the street.    And, uh, why do you have that? Exactly?   You never know what\'s gonna happen.  Yeah, two people all alone together, down here in South Beach.  I\'d rather have it and not need it   Uh huh.  Than need it and not have it.    Ah.  Uh huh.  Kind of like a condom.  Which happened last weekend.    Oh, my! Ugh!   Damn, man, I was kidding!   Look, if you\'re too nervous   I\'m fine, all right? Just let me rinse off my mustache.  You are more handsome in your photos.  Oh, yeah, talk to me about handsome.  And you have no trace of Cuban accent.  Yeah, it\'s called tradecraft, genius.    I blend.    Just shut up and get the plans.    You shut up and get the plans.    What? I mean, give me those plans now.  Give me those plans.  You may have them once I confirm the balance in my Swiss account.    Tell him not to bother.    What? Wait, what are we doing?   Conway! What the shit, man?   What? Schmeck was a traitor.  Yeah, now he\'s all over my 400 dollar custom shirt.  I\'ll buy you a new one.  Now grab the plans before it\'s too late.    It\'s already too late.    Ha, ha! Yes it is, now hand over Because it\'s already soaked into the fibers, dumbass.  This is linen! And that is a Cuban hit squad.  And you might want to duck.  Oh, my God.  Conway!   That was amazing!   Yeah, well, you know.  No, seriously, that was like   That was like, uh   A Charles Whitman Sampler? Damn it, yes.  Seriously, thanks.  Oh, don\'t thank me yet.  What, Conway? No!   Now you can thank me.    Oh, my God.  You saved my life twice.  You\'d have done the same for me.    No, I wouldn\'t have.    Ha, ha.  I was actually kind of planning to kill you.    Wait, what?   I know, now I\'m totally embarrassed.  Hey, you know what? Water under the bridge, dude.    Come over here, let\'s man hug it.    All right.  Okay.  Um I mean, after all we are going to be family.  Once I marry your Mom.    What?   I\'m kidding.  God, relax, man.  Because for a second there, I was like I mean, not in a racist way, but   Conway?   Yeah, buddy.    Uh, are there more bad guys behind me?   Nope.  You dick.  You dumbass.  I set this whole thing up.  I just needed a stand in for those broke ass Cubans.    Yeah, I get it.    I mean, come on! The Chinese\'ll pay five times as much for the Whisper Drive.  And once they do? Let\'s just say you better learn to use some chopsticks, buddy.  Conway, wait.  Just answer me one question.  Yeah, make it quick.  My ride is here.    And your lungs are filling up with blood.    Did you have sex with my mother? Wait, what? That is your only question? Not who am I, not how did I infiltrate ISIS or who the hell is flying the helicopter?   Just answer the question! No, Archer, I didn\'t have sex with your mom.    Oh, thank God.    Oh, and that? That would have been a though image to get out of my head.  That, right there? That kind of racism is exactly why I can\'t wait to see tiny little Chinese boots on your white ass necks.  Which may sound hypocritical, I know, but Would you go?   Aah! What the?   Sorry, Conway.    Oh, wait, shit, I had something for this.    Aah.  Is it something like, uh, "You don\'t get off the hook that easy"?   Damn it.    Yeah, he\'s good at those.    Well, crawl on over there and blow him.    Hey, come on.    Now, drop the case, Conway!   It\'s cuffed on, woman.  Aah! And how the hell are your hands that freaking strong? Ew.  You haven\'t seen the last of Conway Stern! Which is not my real name! Uh, so let me guess.    Yeah.  Whoever he is, he ghosted an ID file onto our worldwide database.  Yeah.  Which you probably found while researching me.  Lana, because you\'re in the, uh Danger Zone.  And those were his last words.  Right before he bled to death on the rug.  Which rug? Oh, good.  I thought you meant in the bedroom.  No, that one is just jute.  Exactly.  Guests come in from the beach, they\'re all sandy or whatever, and Suspension? Lana, dear, you are getting a bonus.  My God! You foiled that perfidious Conway, saved Sterling\'s All right, just pull the knife out.  And then slap Saran Wrap on the hole.  Oh! But leave me enough to make guacamole.  No, you squeeze lemon juice over it, then smush the Saran Wrap right down on top.  That way it doesn\'t go brown.  Oh, let the paramedics do that.  You just have fun, dear.  Mm hm.  Bye.  Oh, damn.  Now I bet she\'s going to squeeze up all my brand new lemons.  And I\'ll have nothing left to remind me of Conway.    Except his little mocha love child.    His what? Yeah.    You had sex with Conway? Yeah, and he totally impregnated me.  Wait, he was only here two days.  How is that pregnancy test showing positive? Oh, this is just a detergent pen.  I just put a little blue sticker on it.Torvald Utne.  The Olympic shot putter? The chairman of the UN Intelligence Committee.  Do you not even skim the briefings in your inbox?   I have an inbox?   Utne decides which spy agency gets the insanely lucrative UN contract.  And as you may or   probably don\'t know, for six years running the contract has gone to ODIN.  Ugh.  The Organization of Douche bags In In   Wait, I had something.    Douche baggery notwithstanding   Nowheresville.  their ground floor isn\'t a laundromat.    Wash and fold, technically.    ISIS needs that UN contract.  So I am going to woo Mr.  Torvald Utne   Gross.  with a dinner party.  Tonight.    And you\'re uninviting me in advance.    Normally, yes.  But this party is different.  And very important so absolutely nothing can go wrong.  Then we better keep Dr.  Bellows away from Jeannie   No, no dates.    I Dream of Jeannie.  No one is bringing a date, so don\'t you bring a date.  I don\'t wanna get there and be the only one without a date.  And I don\'t want another one of your sullen whores using my medicine cabinet like a Pez dispenser.  Peggy, you will probably kill me for this but Senator, we now have a subway museum If Are you still big into trains? That wasn\'t her fault.  Who puts OxyContin in a Xanax bottle?   People with servants, idiot.    Lf they steal pills how does it help to switch the labels?   Because they can\'t read English.  Ha, ha.  I\'m gonna leave you to think about that whole line of reasoning   You think.    And what scheme you\'re hatching for this dinner party.    There\'s no scheme hatchery.  Hello?   Do you mind? It\'s the caterer.  Right.  Okay, sure.  Your instructions are clear?   Ja.  No problem.  Oh, I have other call.  Yeah, okay.    Hello? Oh.  Hello?   Da, da.    So your instructions are clear?   Da.    Excellent.    Uta, get dressed, we work tonight.  But Mani, what about The Fantasticks? Tomorrow, liebchen, I promise, but to   You brought this ridiculous thing.    Is it so ridiculous to ready my body for the baby?   Uta.  Please do not start this.  Just ready your body for work, hmm? Fine.  What is the job? Two jobs.  The first, we make a big phony attempt to kill Torvald Utne.    Okay.  And the second? We kill Torvald Utne.  So your instructions are clear? Drinks and fish balls.  You ring first bell for dinner.  And on second bell, I come out, all John Wooey screaming crazy and shooting blanks.  Then I throw myself in front of Utne, shielding him with my supple body as you\'re gunned down by ISIS agents.  Who are also shooting blanks.  Mm hm.    And loud ones.  Because for Utne to buy it, everyone must act surprised.    Oh, I\'m sure they will.    Yeah, me too.  Mani, I have a bad feeling for this.  Why? Only I will have real bullets.  This is taking chocolate from a baby.  Oh, no, we won\'t give our baby chocolate.    Ugh.    He can have carob.  Thanks for inviting us to your swanky dinner party, Ms.  Archer.    Yeah, I could get used to this.    Don\'t.  You\'re only here because I may need you to take one for the team.    Torvald is an incorrigible poon hound.  Ha, ha.    Those are enormous in size.  Oh, well   Uh, thank you.  Kind of.    May I please cup one in my hand?   Ooh.  See, here\'s the thing   We\'re actually together.  Cyril, go get some gravlax.  Torvald, feel free to cup anything in the room.  Uh Oh, you were talking about my guns.  Strange that you wear them to a party.    Normally I wouldn\'t, but Malory   But that\'s ISIS for you.  Always primed and ready for action.  This is good to know.    Yeah, how about that? Which is why you should consider ISIS for the UN contract.  Our agents are highly trained in many disciplines.    Like Krav Maga, for instance.    My arm, my arm.    You\'re breaking my arm.    Lana.    Oh, I\'m sorry.  Did that hurt?   Yes, it hurt.  What is wrong with you? Nothing but too much enthusiasm for the opportunity to serve the UN.    Oh, and hands like the Truckasaurus.    Hey.    Gravlax, anyone?   No.  No gravlax.  I need painkillers.    Cyril, in my medicine cabinet Wait, no.    Aah.  I have to get it myself, just right after I get that.    Hello.    You\'re late.    What is that smell?   Gravlax and failure.  I think Lana just broke Torvald\'s hand.    Truckasaurus.  Ha, ha!   And we won\'t win that contract if Who on God\'s green earth dressed you? Nobody, that\'s why I\'m late.  Woodhouse just disappeared.  Only temporarily, sir.  Why are you here?   Actually sir, I\'m with Carina.    Who?   Carina.    Ugh.    I changed it again.  I feel that Carina better captures my sensual womanhood.  Yeah, she so totally does.    You said no dates.    I said no such thing.    Well, your mouth did.    Well, your mouth better get over there and make Torvald happy.    Um, phrasing? Regale him with exciting tales of ISIS exploits.  Take his mind off Lana\'s huge, Johnny Benchian fingers.    Can we get off my fingers?   Yeah, they are pretty big.    First time I\'ve heard you complain.    Hi ho! Ha, ha.    Seriously, who wants gravlax?   Sterling, go.  Regale him.    I think he\'s already being regaled.  Meatballs!   Oh, for Torvald.    Bet you get that a lot, huh, Torvie? Swedish meatballs.  Get away from me, you disgusting woman.    Wow.  So even Pam got a date.    A man, even.  But suave master spy, Sterling Archer, stands alone.  Just like the cheese.    I have a   And a very handsome cheese, at that.  I don\'t even know how you got out, Woodhouse.    Alone.    And I do have a date.    You do? Where is she?   She is parking.  Oh, yeah? What\'s she driving? A Snuffleupagus? Uh, oh, wait.  Uh, with all that sexy European lingerie modeling Mm hm? to pay for her European med school that she\'s going to she probably never had time to learn to drive.  She sounds fabulous.    Gravlax?   Thanks, no.  I\'m allergic to cat piss.  Go away.  So your instructions are clear?   Oh.  Why must you micromanage everything? Yeah, yeah, okay.  You know what second hand smoke does to a fetus.  Uta, after we kill Utne we need to have a very long and serious talk.  No.  I need a painkiller, not a   Torvald.    What is that? A calcium supplement?   Trust me, dear, these work wonders.    Okay.  But what I have seen ISIS is a distant second to ODIN.  Very distant.  What about the groundbreaking work Dr.  Krieger is doing for ISIS in our Applied Research Division?   Yeah, tell him about the sex robot.    The what?   Yes The what?   I call him Fister Roboto.    But it doesn\'t just fist.  Tell him.    Pam! He\'s a fully integrated multi fetish artificial being.    That is the most disgusting   Shut up.  Shut, shut.  And the best part is that he\'s learning.    ISIS clearly is not the agency for us.  Rotten gravlax, sex bots, and, uh except for the Negress, the women are Willing to do whatever it takes.    Still gross.    And such rudeness.    Fister Roboto wouldn\'t take that.    He\'s just too damn sensitive.  As also am I.  So if you will excuse There, there.  Let that calcium citrate seep into your bones.  What about Trinette? She said that? How about Jade? Oh, no, never mind.  Destiny? No, she\'s not passable.  With that Adam\'s apple she looks like she swallowed a Rubik\'s Cube.  Excuse me, sir.    L   You are looking for a date?   Are you working? Mm.  You could say that, yes.  Then we need to lock down your cover story.  And, uh I need to hit an ATM.  Torvald, please, don\'t go yet.    You haven\'t even tried the fish balls.    No need.  There is plenty of fishiness going on at ISIS without your balls.  Maybe I should go say something.  Where\'s the damn fish balls, already? I could kill for some food.    Sure it wouldn\'t be the first time.    Lana.  No, I just meant like she literally killed somebody.  Then ate their corpse.  I saw where you were going.    You know   When I served in the King\'s African Rifles the local Zambezi tribesmen called human flesh "long pig. " Never much cared for it.  Torvald, at least stay for dinner.    I think you\'ll be very surprised by   I detest surprises.  Which is why the contract will remain with ODIN.  Mani, do something.  Utne is leaving.  Okay, okay, we go ahead of schedule.  Find some Tupperware, we take food to go.  But you promised me Ruby Foo\'s.  Yeah, I also promised you a baby.  How\'s that working out for you?   Hey, does that cook seem weird?   Normal weird or German weird? Now, good night, and good Evening, you beautiful girl.    Hello.    You\'re not, um, leaving, are you? No, not if you are staying, Miss?   Oh, um Yup.    Hbsch.    Elke Hbsch.    A pleasure, my dear.    I am Torvald   Utne, I know.    I am a great admirer.    You know he\'s not the shot putter, right? Of course he is not the shot putter.  But I am sure he is very strong.  Ha, ha.  Unlike these drinks.  Come, my dear let us find something potable.    Whoa.  Wait a minute.  Hey, Utne.  Utne!   Would you shut up? We just need to keep Torvald happy until dinner.    And what about my happiness, Mother?   Well?   Oh, was that not rhetorical? The Needle? Why is she here? Oh, that Russian prick.  He sent two teams again.  And if the Needle kills Utne, we won\'t even get our per diem.  But what if you kill them both? Oh.  Yeah, I could do this.  Hey, help.    Ah! Help with what, sir? No, I was addressing you as "help. " What\'s the story on those fish balls?   Coming right out.    Hurry it up.  All I\'ve had today is, like six gummy bears and some Scotch.    This is why I don\'t get you nice things.    Not that.  Him.  Uta, that was Duchess.    That was Duchess?   Yeah, the deadliest agent there is.  Oh, my God.  I can\'t believe they fell for that.  But if he\'s on the plan of Frau Archer What if her plan is a big fat set up? What if they mean to kill us?   Oh! Mani, the baby.    Ah.  Okay.  So now we go to Plan Manfred.    And then Ruby Foo\'s.    Well, we will see.  Really? A European lingerie model.  Only to pay for European med school.  Ha, ha.    Like to get a physical from her.    Or with her.  Ha, ha.    Ow, ow, ow!   I wonder if Dr.  Panty Model knows how many pounds it takes to snap a collarbone?   She probably uses the metric system.    Yeah, what do they use? Kilowatts?   No, in this case it would be pascals.    Ugh.  Hey, Europe, be gayer.    Lana.  Release him.    As you wish.    I find your lack of faith disturbing.    I find your mannish hands disturbing.  I think they\'re kinda sexy.    Excuse me?   They\'re fingers, Pam, not kielbasas.  But keep them limbered up.  I have a big surprise planned for dinner and I need you ready, locked, and loaded.  Yeah so, do you maybe want to let us in on your little scheme hatchery?   No.    Oh, if I were 20 years younger.    I can make you feel like you are.    Mm.  I would like I think that very much.    Well then go find an ATM,   I\'m sorry? Oh, me too.  I must leave for a moment.    Excuse me.    Yeah, sorry, don\'t mind me.    Hey, are you having a good time?   Oh, I am.  Ha, ha.  Good to hear.  Please excuse us.  Mm hm.  Keep her out of the medicine cabinet.  One more dead body in here, and that bitch Trudy Beekman will have me right back in front of the co op board.  You don\'t get along with your neighbors anywhere.  Who could with a woman who wallpapered her guest bathroom with vintage New Yorker covers? Yes, Major.  I am in position and ready to eliminate the target.  Excellent.  ODIN will find it much harder  to bribe a dead man for the UN contract.  And I will find it much more enjoyable to work with the woman who runs ISIS.    What do you mean "with?"   Against.  Obviously.  Duh.  Obviously.  And so I still think you should let me kill everybody here.  Nyet.  Under no circumstances are you to harm the hostess.  Who, um   Whose name I have no way of knowing.  Hey.  What the hell are you doing?   Uh, Botox.    Not from the medicine cabinet.  No.  Don\'t use this.  She switches all the labels on her medicine.    Why?   I think there\'s, like, a racial component.  But for all we know, this could be insulin.    Oh, your mother is a diabetic?   How should I know? Why don\'t you just pour it on everybody\'s? Because our employer was very clear: We are not to harm the hostess.  But her I want to poison most of all.    Are you lazy Huns ready, or what? Oh.  Ha, ha.  Hello, yep.    Good.  So on the second bell   I come out shooting blanks.  See? Uta is just, uh, polishing the gun.  Give me that.  Some idiot dropped a fish ball on my Azerbaijani rug.    I am that idiot.    Ach.  Why are you so immature? I\'m 19.  Elke? Is everything all right? Wunderbar, Tovald.    How are you?   I am fantastic, my dear.  Those calcium supplements are amazing.  You\'re gonna need some calcium, after I do something bad to your bones.  Hello?   Hello?   Can you hear me? Come in.    What? Wait.    What the hell?   What is the frequency? Kenneth?   Turn off.  Turn off.  Turn off.  What? I can\'t hear you, tiny man.  Oh, great.  Thanks, Mother, for replacing the baby aspirin with LSD.  God, that is just hmm, classic her.  Places, everyone.    Is everyone comfy? Relatively.  Sterling and Lana? You both have a clear line of sight to the kitchen?   Yes?   Sure, I think so.    Well then let\'s eat.  First bell.    Wow.  Forgot how much I hated that.    Oh, that\'s right.  I kept it on the nightstand to wake Nanny whenever Sterling wet the bed.  Ha ha ha!   L Mother! Sissy bed wetter.    Wait, whose bed?   It was always "don\'t ask, don\'t tell. " Woodhouse.  What are you doing?   Uh, sitting down, sir.    What, at the table? Like people? Sterling.    Sterling.    What? Look, he thinks he\'s people.  This Archer is a gigantic douche bag.  Oh, Torvald.    Who cares about him?   Oh.  Woodhouse, dear, please have a seat.    Very kind of you, ma\'am.  Shut up.    Torvald, a toast?   Sure, go crazy.    Oh Then, um   Hooray.  Dig in.  Wow.    And what is this we\'re eating?   It smells vaguely poisonous.  It does smell vaguely poisonous.    Are you sure she has the right plate?   Pretty sure.    Oh, Uta.    What? I am pretty sure.  Don\'t worry, this is a normal smell.    This is called Janssons frestelse.    Frestel? Yes, frestelse.  It means "temptation. " Oh, Torvald.  I am very tempted.  Yes, and I am tempted to give ISIS the UN contract, Malory.  Hmm? I mean, you are?   Well, it depends on your frestelse.  Mm.  Tell me, my dear, is it tempting? Elke, what is the matter? Are you? Um   What? That\'s the wrong plate, Uta.  Uta.  That\'s how you talk.    Perfidy.    No, Torvald, there\'s no perfidy.    You poison my food over a contract?   Torvald, I swear I didn\'t When I am finished with ISIS, you won\'t be able to get a contract for a pre paid mobile phone.    No, no! I will tear you down brick by perfidious brick.    It\'s okay.    Aah! It\'s okay, they\'re just blanks.    Oh.    Well, see, you say that.    But they were blanks.  Weren\'t they?   Uh, only if the back of his skull picked that exact moment to explode outwards.    What? Ugh!   Oh, my God.    Damn it.  Where are those Germans? What? I should not do this in my condition.  What condition? Your only condition is that you are a stupid crazy girl.  Do not speak to me like a child, Manfred.  I hate when you do that.  I think you like it.  Ja.  Because I think you have some serious and unresolved issues with your father.  Yeah? And maybe that is why I date a wrinkled old man like you.    Wow.    I didn\'t mean that.    No, no, it\'s okay.  I think we both knew it.    Oh, Mani.  Just strange to hear it out loud.    Oh, for shit\'s sake.    And they didn\'t do one dish.    This is funny to you?   I ate a bunch of that LSD you had labeled as baby Aspirin.    That was baby Aspirin.    Oh.  Hey, guys?   Wait, what?   What, uh?   What\'s the plan here?   I shall fetch a rug.  No you will not.  That rug was a gift from the Azeri Khan himself.  And besides, we\'re not going far.  Is that hard to do? With those big old ballpark frankenfingers? Shut up.  Hurry, the Beekmans will be back any time.  And nobody touch anything.  God, Cyril, would you go?   Unh.  I should be carrying her.    Cyril, I paid her, I get to carry her corpse.  See? Just look at this bathroom.  I kinda like it.  Exactly.  All right, drop them there next to that awful Louis Quinze repro.  Now then.  We want this to look like a classic hooker murder suicide so, Cyril.  Take Sterling\'s gun and pump a round into his prostitute.  Wait, what? Everyone shoots the chippy.  That way, we\'re all in it together.  Think of it as a team building exercise.  ODIN gets to go on Outward Bound.  ODIN can suck it.  Now shoot.  Oh, Jesus.  You\'re next.  Cyril, that was pathetic.  Come on.  Everybody shoots.  Hey, I wanna go.  Bam! Now, Sterling, drop your gun between the bodies, and No.  Have you never seen CSI? This is already, like, Clue Town.  Not for long.  Dr.  Krieger, dear? What? Oh.  Cyril, call 911 from their phone and leave it off the hook and Sterling.  But this gun, it was a gift.  Oh, please.  Nobody gives you gifts.  You don\'t know.  Whatever you say, dear.  Dr.  Krieger? Now, then Still didn\'t get the contract.  Oh, but I will.  And I\'ll get to see Trudy Beekman try to explain this little barbecue to the co op board.  That smell takes me back.    Just like a Zambezi feast.  Yeah, I\'m kinda hungry.    Is that weird? It would be weirder if you weren\'t.  Well this torte\'s a winner, Malory.    What was the name again?   Kladdkaka.  Stop it.  I\'m sorry.  That That\'s a funny word.  Oh, I thought we were laughing at the dead people we set on fire.  Um, sorry.Oh! Oh, I cannot believe you.  Are you out of your big fat Russian skull? Of all the dumb stunts you\'ve Nikolai, how could you do this?   With KGB surveillance team.  They   Not "how" how, you ass.  "Why" how.  For record of activities in Krakow.  Oh, some blurry eight millimeter of No, we have the digital hi def now.  Wonderful.  So they can blow it up for the jury at my treason trial.  Is amazing, no loss of resolution Damn your bloodshot eyes, I\'m serious.  I will not let that happen to you.  You let this happen.  And by doing so, jeopardized our entire operation.  Darling, please.  Don\'t say that.  I have no idea how this Ramn Limn  got the disk.  He must have gone rogue.  Oh, all Hispanics look roguish.  The KGB had no idea about my plan.  So please, do not blame Major Jakov.  Oh, right, how could I? The important thing is that the disk does not fall into the wrong hands.    You mean "wronger" hands.    Like your government\'s.  Or mine.  I find it very surprising that Castro okayed an operation with such potential to embarrass the Soviets.  Well, he is unpredictable.  Which is why I am planning ahead for my retirement.  In beautiful Miami.  And so, here are the keys and the deed to my condo in South Beach.  A nice start to a new start.  But what of the financial arrangements? You\'ll get the money when I get the disk.  And if you\'ve made copies I tried, but the Russian was smart enough to copy protect the disk.  Yeah, he\'s a real genius.  But if you try to double cross me Well, you should know what kind of a man you are dealing with.    Oh, Ramn.  I think I know exactly what kind of man you are.  Uh, que? I said I could eat the absolute pants off some shrimp.  I don\'t suppose he\'s up.  No, mum.  And from the looks of it, not to mention the lemur I would hazard he\'s taking a personal day.  The hell he is.  Woodhouse, we got any lube? Like at this point even olive oil would help me get that drawer unstuck.  Jesus God, Sterling.  Schoolgirls?   Those are costumes.    I suppose that makes it better? Doesn\'t it? Oh, uh, Woodhouse, I told my guests you\'d pack their lunch.  I\'ll do my best, sir.  I\'m afraid the lemur got into the pudding cups.    Yeah, like I told you he would.  You idiot.    Will you please focus? Now, I know you\'re familiar with the honey pot.  Seducing and blackmailing a hot female enemy agent.  I love the honey pot.  I\'m sure you do.  But this time you may not find the target appealing.    What, is it Pam? Seriously, whoever.  It\'s all the same in the dar No.    Yes.  Yes.  Yes!   No.  No.  Come on.    Have Gillette do this.    Sterling, you\'re the only one I can trust.  And don\'t even get me started on Miss Gillette.  She has never liked me.  But someday I\'m gonna write a book about this place.  Mm hm.  A real smackarooni.  Sterling, please, I need your help.  This Ramn Limn is blackmailing me.    With what? What\'s he got on you?   It\'s none of your nosy beeswax.    Well, then it sucks to be you.  You\'ll be who it sucks to be if I have to call my bridge partner.  Oh, who\'s your bridge partner?   The district attorney.    So? Sir, that stolen lemur bit one of your prostitutes right in the face and she says she can\'t go to hospital because she\'s, quote, "tripping balls. " You know, when I was little, I used to pretend you weren\'t my mother.    Me too.  Bang.  Bang.  Ew, kill.  Bang.    Shock.    Shut up.  Oh, my God, bang.    I hesitate to even ask.    We\'re doing "Kill, Bang, Marry. "   Again, hesitation.    It\'s on the ISIS Intranet.  You click through pictures of everybody who works here, and say if you\'d rather   Kill them or bang or marry them.    Wow, that is entirely inappropriate.  That\'s what I said.  If you go through the whole list you can see what everybody said.    Everybody? Like?   Like Lana.  And if, I don\'t know maybe she said "bang" about Mr.  Archer?   I got ups.  Move it, chubs.    Hey.  Dr.  Krieger\'s covert team installed these surveillance cameras while Limn was out shopping yesterday.  Yup, we\'ve got video and audio with a satellite feed back to these hard drives.    Same set up I\'ve got in my van.    Jesus, Krieger.    You\'re still taping bum fights?   No, now I\'m into something darker.    Ahem! Since that obnoxious little Castro is such a raging homophobe   Fidel hates the gays.  it\'s a safe bet he\'d have Ramn killed if he ever found out he was gay.    So once you seduce him   Whoa, whoa, whoa.  I thought nobody else was supposed to know about this.    He won\'t remember.    Yeah, no, I\'m   I am shitfaced.  Miss Archer, phone call.    I\'m busy.    Um, we all are?   Bang.  Uh, kill, I guess.    Thanks a lot.    It\'s a bad picture, Pam.  He says it\'s urgent.  Something about developments in Krakow? Krakow? Oh, for Sterling, get to Miami, and don\'t come back until you\'ve completed your assignment.    Taking one for the team, huh?   Hopefully not.  Well if you do, I\'ve developed a proprietary chemical compound which may come in handy.  I call it Formula K.  And it makes you temporarily gay? I don\'t know.  Just started human testing.  By dosing Danny the intern\'s coffee.    Danny is definitely feeling something.    I think I\'m going to pass.  Suit yourself.  Just means more for me and Danny.  Who is loving it.  I have ascertained the target, sir.  And he\'s actually quite handsome.  And I suppose that makes it better.    Doesn\'t it?   No, it Woodhouse, this is Miami.  Don\'t you have any cooler clothes?   No sir, not anymore.    And your shoes.  Because how hard is it to poach a goddamn egg properly? Seriously, that\'s like Eggs 101, Woodhouse.  Now I know you\'ve lost your mind.  You want me to defect to Russia? Just, uh, you know, if the worst happens.  That is the worst.  Standing in the snow for beet rations in my Blahniks?   Come on.  I\'m head of KGB.  I have my beets delivered.    Nikolai.    Free Stolichnaya, Beluga caviar.  My own private limousine.  The Soviet system is actually incredibly unfair.    And it just sounds wonderful, but   Hey, I\'m just putting it out there.  Well, just put it back in.  You\'re the whole reason I\'m in this mess.  I\'m trying to help.  I mean, if that Cuban does not fall for the honey pot.  Oh, I think he will.  I\'ve got my top man on it.  Or possibly bottom.    Ahem.  Can I help you?   I don\'t know.  Can you?   Is this some sort of viral marketing?   What? No, I meant Or are you asking me, specifically, if I have a penis? Uh, it\'s more of a conversation starter.  And here\'s a conversation ender.  Adios.    Oh, bilingual snap.    Thank you.  Do you not see me rocking this chiseled slab of hard man body?   I mean, come on.  Are you gay or not?   I am.    But you.  You are so not my type.    What? Hey, I am everybody\'s type.    Oh, please.    What?   You are entirely too gay.    No, I\'m not.    Are you kidding?   Oh my God, you, like, sneeze glitter.  Thank you.  So, yeah.  I\'m an ISIS agent and that Ramn guy\'s a Cuban agent and, uh, I\'m supposed to run what we call a honey pot on him.  I can\'t believe you have all this stuff and it\'s, like, portable.  I can\'t believe you blab that you\'re a secret agent.  I can\'t believe you\'re a hairdresser and Rudi\'s an interior decorator.    God, he\'s the best in Miami.    Thank you.    You\'re quite welcome, sir.    Lf I had a spoon No, no, no.  I would eat you up.    Don\'t be nice.  So this spy agency, is it, like, the real CIA "James Bondy" deal, or what? Charles, ISIS employs some of the world\'s foremost intelligence analysts, covert operatives, and scientists.    Wait, did Cyril play this stupid game?   You\'ll have to play to find out.  Danny.  Danny, stop running.  We gotta keep that heart rate down, buddy.  Okay, kill.  Bang.  Bang.    Ew, kill.    Well, thanks a lot.    Pam, it\'s a bad picture.    I think that\'s hot.  Like, somebody murdering me? It\'s so intimate.    So, yeah, basically, we\'re the front line in the fight against tyranny.  Thank you.    My pleasure.    I wanna dress you up like a little gnome and just have you live in my garden.    I would like some new clothes.  Shut up.  But also and speaking of clothes these seem way too normal.    What, normal as opposed to gay? Implying that gay is abnormal? Not abnormal, just gay.  In spite of your personality, you get plenty of women, right? Uh, duh and or hello.  So, "duh and or hello," just act like you normally do around women.    Really? Because how hard is it to poach a goddamn egg properly? I believe he means before you lure them into the apartment, sir.  Oh.  Yeah, that makes more sense.  So I just like, what? Approach him in a bar?   Yeah, If I were you, I\'d try The Cock Fight.    What? A cockfight?   It\'s the name of a gay bar.    They also have actual cockfights.  Yeah, Latino men.  You take the bad with the good.  Jesus, what\'s your problem?   You are.  Blonde, brunette.  I thought I made it clear you are not my type.  Is that where we landed on that, because l Dios mo.  Is your ego so large you cannot handle a single rejection?   Yes.    Let me buy you a drink.    I already have a drink.  Why don\'t you buy him one? He could use it.  Why Why don\'t we all have one and talk about it.  Seriously Woodhouse, how can you be so totally awesome and not be gay? Well, I was very fond of a boy at school once.  Reggie Thistleton.    But he died in the war, at Flanders.    Flanders?   What war was that?   Oh, the Great War.    They\'re all great.    Oh, my God, yes, those Nazi uniforms?   Hugo Boss.    Shut up.  Swear to God.  And look at slut, just getting home.    Well, I guess our advice worked.    No, it didn\'t.    Ramn blew me off.    Then where were you all night? Way the Christ out in the Everglades burying some Dominican guy\'s rooster.    Fun.    Oh, you mean literally.    Yes.  Sorry.    I mean, look at my clothes.  And what the hell are you wearing, Woodhouse?   L   We bought those for him.  If you throw them off the roof I\'ll fly to New York and fling acid in your face.    Thank you.  Oh, great.  Mother, I have nothing to report yet.  This is a lot harder than I thought.  How hard could it be to talk a gay man  into having anonymous sex?   See the stereotypes we put up with?   You don\'t know what I\'m dealing with.  You don\'t know what I\'m dealing with! See? Here is my nice building, my limousine, my mother.  Oh, and my apartment is two bedrooms, so she won\'t even have to move out.  So you just listen to me, Mr.  Man.  Get me some video of hot man on man action by tonight or don\'t bother coming home.    She sounds fabulous.    Yeah, she\'s actually not.  But the stereotype thing got me thinking because, let\'s see, Ramn is Latino   And Latinos are all about machismo.  So you may have to out macho him.  Out macho a gay guy? Oh, my stars.  Or, wait, you could just be a sarcastic bitch your whole life.    Thank you.  Wait a Did you set this whole thing up just so I\'d have to come live with you and your mother?   No! It was merely incompetence.    And I suppose that makes it better? Doesn\'t it? Wait a minute, how do you know Ramn\'s playing jai alai right now?   Um, he\'s Latino.    So it\'s either that or dominoes.  Stereotypes exist for a reason.  Okay, we\'re off to get our scrotums waxed.  Ramn, hey.  I have a proposition for you.  Mama, have to call you back.    Don\'t you ever give up?   Not when it comes to somebody refusing to have sex with me.    You know, consensually or whatever.    Hmm.  So me and you, one on one, loser has to do whatever the winner says.    Lf I win I want you to leave me alone.    Fine.  But if I win we go to your place and have, you know gay sex.    Have you ever played jai alai? Uh, actually, lacrosse.  But it\'s jai alai for white people.    Lacrosse is gay.    You\'re gay.  I mean, I am too.    We\'re both gay.    Seriously, I can serve this pelota almost two hundred miles an hour.    Big whoop, that little squishy   Jesus, is this made of limestone?   It\'s a dangerous game.  Yeah? Well, I\'m dangerous.  And I\'m gonna win.    And gay sex.    Okay.    Go stand over there.    Where, over here?   Mm, little more far.    What, here?   Is this?   S, s.  That\'s good, right there.  That\'s what you\'re gonna be saying when I\'m, uh, all inside you with gay sex.    Are you ready?   Yeah, I\'m ready.    Wait, do I need a helmet?   Probably.  Wait, what? I mean, after all you are playing a very dangerous game Sterling Archer of ISIS.  There he is.  Welcome back, amigo.  Jesus Christ, who apparently uses the same awful decorator as my mother.  Trust me, whoever decorated this condo is not in heaven.  And neither are you Agent Sterling Archer of ISIS.    Wait, you know who I am? Duh and or hola.    So you know why I\'m here.    I assume because your mother forced you to pose as a gay man, in hopes of catching me in a, how you say pot of honey.    Yeah, which is just so classic her.    Oh, you should meet my mother.  She   No, no, no, shut up, listen.  My mother   Oh, my God, that\'s her.    Dios mo.  It\'s her.  L I can\'t believe we hung up on them.    That was so thoroughly awesome, Ramn.    This is awesome.    Here, try it.    No.  Whoa, whoa.    It\'s raw, man.    No, the citric acid from the limes actually cooks the fish.  Try it.  Mm.  Mm!   Oh, my, Ramn, that is amazing.    Right? Mama always said: Mine always said: "Sterling, come in here and check me for lumps. "   Holy shit, was that out loud?   It\'s okay.  This is a safe place.    Yeah, but it\'s not, though.    Are you referring to these?   Ha.  You found Krieger\'s cameras?   I think he is not so good at his job.  Danny! Dude, that whole agency\'s not so good at their jobs.  Kill.  Kill.  God, when do I get to the end so I can see what Cyril said?   You don\'t think that\'s hot?   I seriously think you\'re scary.  No, no, no, like, a big sweaty fireman carries you out of a burning building, lays you on the sidewalk.  You think, he\'s gonna give me mouth to mouth.  But instead he just starts choking the shit out of you and the last sensation that you feel before you die is he is squeezing your throat so hard that a big wet blob of drool drips off his teeth and just: "Blurp!" Falls right onto your popped out eyeball.    Jesus Christ.    I know, right?   What the hell?   I\'m wet just thinking about it.  Cyril? Cyril, you get your ass out here right now.  Is she freaking cause Cyril said he wanted to bang Danny? No, it\'s cause he said he wanted to marry her.  She\'s so weird.  Hey, will you choke me a little bit? Pfft.  That\'s nothing compared to the pendejos I have to work with.    You haven\'t banged half of them like yours truly.    I can\'t.  If Fidel found out I\'m gay, he\'d   Well, that\'s why you\'re here.    And maybe it\'s the concussion but I seriously feel crappy about that.    No.  I feel crappy.  I should not have tried to blackmail your mother.  Yeah, what\'s on this thing anyway? Get on the floor, you tacky ass, white after Labor Day wearing bitches.  Thank you.    Charles and Rudi? What the?   What is the meaning of this?   Sorry.  We\'re a hit squad.  Turns out Fidel is unhappy that one of his top agents is gay.  Ay, dios mo! Hey.  Save your breath for cooling your ceviche.    Ceviche is already cold.    I know.  You dicks were working for Castro this whole time? Positutely, yes.  But we were having such a blast hanging with Woodhouse   Who\'s fine by the way.    I\'m genuinely sorry about this.    But may I can keep the clothes? Forever and always.    Not that you care.    Yeah, I actually don\'t.    So are you two even really gay?   As big old tangerines, yes.  Then how can you work for Castro? You know his stance on homosexuality.  Because, commie, I have something called a mortgage.  Hey, whoa, if this is about money, I know somebody who\'d pay a whole lot of money to get this back.    Sterling, no.    Hey, Ramn, shut up.    Let the mummy talk.    I can\'t let you do this.  What the?   You\'ll never take me alive, bastardos.  Let\'s outsource it to some cracked up Haitians that\'s what I said.  You know why? So you could be all Little Miss "Hindsight\'s 20 20. "   Here, take this.    Why did you have a salad gun?   Ah, I was going to kill you.    Oh, you are just the worst kind of Me? Your mother started all of this.  So give them the freaking disk If I do that it will become public.  And if you see what\'s on this disk   Well if you weren\'t gay, you will be.    Ha, ha! Well, what is it? A sex tape of Mother?   Ahem.    Oh, my But there, you see.  It\'s gone.  So it\'s okay, just let it all Jesus, God, do you ladies want to put on your nightgowns crack open a tube of cookie dough and talk? Goddamn it, we\'re dealing with some profound issues here you queer.    What the hell, man? Sorry, I meant homosexual person.  No, you idiota.  We have a finite number of bullets.    Oh, my bad.    Oh, my bad.    Ha, ha.  Now who feels stupid?   My guess is both of you.  Since the last thing you see is gonna be that horrific sofa.  Shut up, I bet you\'re not even a real interior decorator.  Well, he\'s not licensed or anything, but he\'s got a real flair for it.    Thank you.    So how about stand up and let us paint the walls with your brains.    Here, take this.  Jesus, Ramn, a Claymore?   I can explain.    You were gonna frag me? No.  This was for decorating.  What, look at this place.    I was going to have to start from scratch.    The kitchen\'s not bad.  Oh, God, are you kidding? That kitchen is awful Oh, crap.  No, thank you.  Ramn, was that not totally epic? S, Sterling.  Because you lived to tell the tale.  No, no, no, because my mother\'s condo got trashed.  God, she is gonna freak when Wait, where\'s Charles and Rudi? Hmm.  I think they must have escaped, however implausible that may seem.  That does seem implausible.  And so, I must now go into hiding.  Fidel will keep sending hit squads and he will not stop until I am dead.    So, what, just a life on the run? S, just like el Doctor David Banner.    How do you say "The Hulk" in Spanish?   El Hulk.    Gay.    What?   We don\'t have a word for "Hulk. "   Do you have a word for "gay?"   Gay.    Gayer! Jesus, Spanish, our jobs aren\'t enough.    Now you got to take our words?   Sterling.  I didn\'t mean that, it was racist.  And even though you were gonna shoot and or frag me I feel like we had kind of a connection.  I\'m sad because we had a connection, and now And now I feel like a dick so come on.    Let me turn that frown upside down.    How? Well, the bedroom was untouched by the explosion.    I\'m listening.    So let\'s blow the shit out of it.  Oh.  I thought you meant you wanted to   Ramn.    And just why is that so funny? Not that.  Woodhouse.  He\'s all tied up somewhere.  Scared Scared and alone.  Probably dehydrated.I get to go to the French Riviera on the ISIS dime to do what? Locate a stolen shipment of Redeye missiles and kill the arms dealer trying to sell them, Spirodon Skorpio.  Whoa, what, is diabetes busy? Don\'t underestimate Skorpio.  There\'s a reason the bounty on him is so high.    Like, high enough to redo my kitchen?   Ugh.  What did I tell you? That Saltillo tile is terrible for a kitchen because it\'s so porous.  And Mexican whore house y.  So I\'m sure your cook feels at home.    Hey, Pita isn\'t a whore.    Not until you got a hold of her.    First of all   Oh, shut up.  The bounty on Skorpio is more than enough for a new kitchen   I also have the nook And the rest you can set aside for Pita\'s inevitable medical expenses.  Ugh.  Like, one time that happened.  It\'s pretty late.  Why don\'t you take a cab? Mr.  Sterling? I have problem.  I\'ll pay for it.  Again? Seriously, Pita You\'re killing me here.  Again? This was supposed to be coconut shrimp.  One, three times.  But it\'s the Pope\'s fault she won\'t let me wear a condom.    Why don\'t you wear a vasectomy?   This again? Don\'t you want a grandkid? Well, if I did, I\'d just scrape all your previous mishaps into a big pile and knit a onesie for it.    Jesus Christ.    Sorry, I\'ve been fasting and I\'m edgy.    Still though   Sterling.    Okay.  If there\'s money left after the kitchen, then vasectomy maybe.  You do want the assignment?   Yeah, I want it.    You really, really, really want it? Yes.  I really want it.  Well, too bad.  Because guess what.  Womp womp.    Why does she get the mission?   Because I said so.  Either way, we have a plane to catch.  We? Why are you going? I\'m going to, um, a conference? Oh, well, isn\'t that convenient? If you think that\'s convenient, wait till you see my new kitchen.  Ha! Seriously though, you should look through some of her design catalogs.  So, zoom, you\'re just jetting off to France?   Isn\'t that kind of sudden?   No, baby.  Sudden is wanting to move in with somebody after four months.  Talking.  Just talking about it.  You know, I mean, jeez, I moved in with my last girlfriend after four weeks.    What are you, a lesbian? Why, would you be into that? Just curious.  Which was an odd word choice right there, and am I talking out loud? Now remember, I want the entire data system on those new servers or I will just make it rain pink slips.    I\'m not doing that.    That\'s a poor motivator.  Lana, I want you to call or text me at the top of every hour.    I\'ll call or text at the   I\'m gonna be kind of busy, hon.  Well, it\'s all on this schedule.  Oh, no, honey.  The doors are closing and I didn\'t get the Oh, so close.  So your conference wouldn\'t be for control freaks who micro manage everything, would it?   What? No, that\'s not why I\'m But look, you be careful with Skorpio.  He won\'t hesitate to kill you.    Unless I get smothered to death.    Oh.  That\'s just pathetic.    But even though Cyril may be clingy   Oh.  Saran Wrap could take a lesson.    You used to complain constantly that Sterling was emotionally distant.  Yeah, I was just being nice, though.  I wonder if he\'s like that because I used to spank him with a wooden spoon.  Uh Yeah, I don\'t know about that, but it might explain the ping pong paddle.  My point is, dear, you can trust Cyril.  Now you go have a fun assassination.  Okay, and you go have fun at your thing.  Oh, I will.  Bye, dear.  Did you rent a boat? Da, is very Ahem.  Pretty nice boat.  It better be, Mr.  Sex Tape.  And you, scuff that luggage, and I\'ll cut your hamstrings for you.    I think we\'re making some progress.    Where, in opposite world?   We\'re never gonna finish all this.    We can, if certain people would help.  I\'m sorry, are you addressing me? Because your authority is not recognized in Fort Kickass.    Ugh! Mr.  Archer, you could help.  Hey, I\'m helping Cyril.  Text her again.    I am, if you\'d shut up.    And really pour out your feelings.    Don\'t listen to him, he\'s just trying to Shut up! Cyril, bare your soul.  So, heh heh, did I say is nice boat, or what? Yes, Nikolai, you certainly did which hopefully explains my shock at finding myself aboard the Chum Guzzler.  I am just getting that.  Well, I know what you\'re not getting.    Give it.  I\'m serious.  Give me my phone.    No, get off.  Cut it out.  Cyril, goddamn it, you\'re smothering Lana.    Pam, I will hit you in the face.    Aha ha ow! Don\'t listen to her, Cyril.  If there\'s one thing women totally love it\'s to be smothered by men.    Heh.  Like you\'d know.    Or choked, in your case.  Cyril, trust me.  Give her some space.  But why hasn\'t she called? I mean, what if she\'s in danger?   Or Or Cyril, come on.  Worst case scenario, her cover got blown and Skorpio\'s raping her senseless   Oh! before he chops her battered corpse into fish food.    What is wrong with you?   How can you say that? What? I said "worst case. " Leave that to your field agent.  Why must you always micro manage? I don\'t.  And if you will recall I used to be an excellent field agent.  Da, is why I fall in love with you.  My God, Kolya, we were so young.  Young and in love, and in Berlin.  On that magical moonlit night, beneath the Bridge of Spies.  The night before you break my heart, and disappear for nine months.  Kolya, there\'s something I\'ve been meaning to tell you.  What is in this drink? Sorry, is ice from cooler.    Somehow it got butter all over it.  Aah! Hey, don\'t be queen of drama.  That wasn\'t me, you idiot.  Oh, dear God.    Cyril, give it to me.    I bet that\'s Lana.    It\'s my phone.  Pam put yours in the blender.    Come on.  It\'s called tough love, Cyril.    The secret ingredient is phone.  Hello.  Mother.  What? Really?   And you\'re sure it was Lana?   What was Lana?   Okay, I\'m on it.  What? Yes.  God.    Come on.    What did she say?   Well, she\'s still really pro vasectomy.    About Lana.    Oh, right.  Yeah, so remember that worst case scenario we talked about?   Oh, my God.    Yes, yes, I remember.    Archer, if anything   Cyril, relax.  I will rescue her.  So, Krieger? How\'s about a roadie? It would be nice to know what kind of danger I\'m facing.  What danger? They do it outpatient.  What? Not the vasectomy, the rescue.  How would I know? I\'m at a conference.    Wait a minute.    You don\'t have a minute.  Now, will you just put a lid on it? All right, I\'m going.    Shitty flying rats.  Just put the damn lid on it.  Commence Operation: "Something about I rescue Lana and she begs me to take her back, so then Cyril commits suicide. " I swear to God I had something for this.  Seriously, are you just bailing on this whole assignment, or what? Who gives a gosh damn about that? Lana\'s captured, maybe even Rescued, Kenny Crybaby.  Come on.  I bet Mr.  Archer already went all double oh ninja on Skorpio\'s ass.  Waa paah!   Karate sound.    You really think so? Cyril, right this second I bet he\'s untying Lana taking off her ball gag   Her what?   And she\'s looking up into his steely blue eyes and parting her moist lips   Wait a minute.    Yeah, hang on, crazy pants.    Let her talk, woman.    As he takes her in his rippling Rambo y arms, throws her down   Oh, my God and then yeah! Oh, yeah! That\'s right! Give it to me! Uhn! Damn it, look what you Shouldn\'t you be off cooking a rabbit somewhere?   I\'ve got some in the lab.    I mean, maybe it\'s not that but there\'s only one way to find out.    Give me that.  Oh, Jesus, God.    I thought I gave you a fake number.  What?   Archer, it\'s me.    Cyril? Hey, I can\'t really talk right now.  Well, that\'s too bad, Mr.  Man.  Now, you just put Lana on the phone.    Well, Cyril I can\'t really do that either.    He says he can\'t put her on.    Archer, put her on the phone.    Cyril, buddy, look when I see her, I will tell her to call you but I can\'t freaking talk right now! Archer? Hello? He hung up.  Probably cause he\'s all: Oh, my God, I can\'t breathe.  And that\'s the reason I don\'t have sex with my co workers.    That and no one ever lets me.    I\'ve had good results with ether.  Oh, no! Oh, my God, Nikolai, something\'s wrong.  Is just fat dripping from kebabs.  Not that.  Kolya, my people need help.    Do you have any KGB agents nearby?   Meh   "Meh" what?   I just don\'t feel so comfortable discussing KGB operations with you.    What? I tell you everything.  Da, but is a little unprofessional.  Swear to God, Lana better be dead on a slab or begging for mercy over a vat of acid or a shark tank or   Drinking champagne in a bikini?   Oh, screw me.  Two minutes, my love.  I am just now again re shaving my balls again.  First of all, you have no right to interfere with my operation.  And not that it\'s any of your beeswax, but I did not have sex with Skorpio.    Oh, really?   No.  God.  I just kept putting him off, making him re shave his balls.  Oh.  So you can hang out on a boat? It\'s a mega yacht.  And I just I needed a break from Cyril.  Who thinks you got captured, or killed.    What was that all about?   Um Uh I actually forget what that was.  I\'ve been hitting the sauce pretty hard.    Jesus.  You are so irresponsible.    Oh, really? Go ask Pita who\'s irresponsible.  Hey, she knew the job was risky going in.    And since you didn\'t do your job   I will, all right? Just give me like a week.  Too late! You had your chance and you blew it.    Now, how\'s my disguise?   Depends.  Who are you supposed to be? Topper Bottoms, stern yet sensual skipper of the USS Rough Service?   What, they\'re your clothes, idiot.    Uhn! Oh, damn it, that was the guy in charge of the chocolate fountain.    There\'s a chocolate fountain?   Oh.  There\'s everything.  Great champagne, ridiculous food a whole, like, squad of hot little Filipina masseuses.    Skeet?   Probably.  I just really need some me time before I have to go back to Cyril and his whole Curiously oppressive brand of love?   I mean, come on, haven\'t I earned that?   Yes, we have.  I\'m staying.    What? No.  No, you\'re not.    Yes.  Yes, I am.  Or would you prefer I tell Cyril you slept with Skorpio?   Even you wouldn\'t stoop that low.    Lana, come on this is me, remember? Unprofessional? From the man who used an entire KGB surveillance team just to make a sex tape of me? Ha.  And entire KGB art department to airbrush wrinkles off your old ass.  I want to leave, please.  Right now.  So who\'s stopping you? Hmm.  Hmm.  Smiles everyone, smiles.  For this party, everything must be as perfect as my beautiful companion.    Ha ha.  Because in one hour, the world\'s most dangerous terrorists will gather here, on the Argo, to bid on my humble wares.  Wait, wait, you.  Chocolate fountain guy.  You look, uh different.    Oh!   Um, I guess I\'ve been working out?   Yes, I can see that.    Quick.  Bring me some duct tape.    I, uh Because this malaka is ripped.  Come, my dear.  Before the party, I must relax on top of you.    Ugh.  No excuses, huh? My balls are smooth.    And you know I love that.    Not as much as I love chocolate.    Oh hoh hoh.    So, you, malaka, bring plenty of it, yes.  I would prefer not to.  Bartleby, the Scrivener? Anybody? Not a big Melville crowd, here, huh? Yeah, he\'s not an easy read.  And I drove her right into his arms.  His big, tan, muscle bulgy arms.  Cyril, come on.  Don\'t listen to What the hell is your name now, anyway?   I don\'t even remember.  Exactly.  So   What are you snorting off me?   It\'s mostly MSG.    The flavor enhancer.    Which you so need.  Pipe down, pipe cleaner.  And, Cyril, it\'s a rescue mission, okay?   Probably fraught with danger.    You really think so? I bet they\'re fighting for their lives.  Wow.  Yeah, that That got a little dark.  So now we have champagne, huh?   Um, got anything a little stronger?   Or way stronger.  Like poison? Mm.  I think I have just the thing.    Oh, my God.    Ready the shark tank for my guests Agents Archer and Kane, of ISIS.    What? You knew the whole time? How you say? Womp womp.    All right, you heard Mr.  Skorpio.    No, just Skorpio.  Remember? How we\'re doing that from now on?   Sorry, sir.    Hang on just one second.  Where was this enthusiasm before? I know, right? Now he wants to contribute.  M Ha ha.  Oh, funny.  Actually, I\'m getting this.  Damn, I had something for this too.  Damn it.  Eat grenade, stupids.    Oh, well, now what?   Ugh.  Are you still here?   Where\'d you get a grenade?   Hanging from the lampshade.  Wait, what?   What? Did he just call me a whore?   Now, why on earth would he do that? Because he turns women into whores.  Just ask his slutty Mexican cook.  Oh, my God, yes.  We should call her, because I would literally murder somebody for some migas right now.  Every single noun and verb in that sentence totally arouses me.  And I\'m so open to that.  And, Cyril, ignore her.  Nothing\'s going on between Archer and Lana.    Although   Although what? Well, every ISIS agent has a company issued life insurance policy, and And what?   You\'re my beneficiary!   Your what? On my company life insurance.  Oh, my God.  I mean, if this goes tits up.  Now? Really? Oh, right.  Because you walked into Strippers\' Discount Warehouse and said, "Help me showcase my intellect. " Discount? Hello, this is Fiacci.  Uh I think it\'s pronounced, "Knock off. " Right after I get back, I\'m changing that stupid policy.  Ugh! Yes, you\'re my beneficiary.  How\'d you get life insurance, Lana? Don\'t they know you\'re in the danger zone? But that doesn\'t mean anything.  I mean they could\'ve forgotten to fill out new beneficiary forms Cyril, they have to update those bennie forms every quarter.    Ouch.    But that means Oh, my God.  Damn ass hammered shit!   What?   Benefits! I forgot to spend the balance in my goddamn flex account!   Are you date of employment, or?   Calendar year!   Ouch.    That\'s just leaving money on the table.  How did you forget that? I guess I was busy fantasizing about Archer and Lana having intercourse!   Ouch.    Cyril, come on, hon, we all were.  And you expect me to believe that? I don\'t care.  Just like I don\'t ever think about you.    Reloading.    Firing.  So when you filled out your insurance, you weren\'t thinking about my muscular arms or my ass, in the combat firing stance?   No, I wasn\'t.  I don\'t.  I mean, I\'m So full of shit, your eyes are brown.  No, they\'re Oh, my God, they\'re green.  Like emeralds.  How did I never see that?   Lana, your eyes are amazing.    Archer.  I mean, not compared to your tits, but Ow! Ow! What is your problem? You.  And plus, I have a boyfriend.  Oh, right, how could I forget Mr.  Cling? Cyril? Cyril, come on.  Let go.  Oh, God, he\'s stronger than he looks.  Get him out of here! Because these corporate bag munchers owe me 630 dollars for my goddamn flex account! I cannot believe you shot me.  God, you know how much I hate that.    You better get used to it.    Kill them, you fools.  Kill them.  Oh, my God.  I am gonna die and you\'re the last man I was in bed with.  Well, one of them.  Don\'t worry, I won\'t tell Cyril.  Probably.    Shit.  I\'m out of ammo.  Archer!   Lana.  Lana.    Do you trust me?   What? No, I don\'t trust you.  Well, that\'s too bad.  Because guess what.  Oh, my God.  Nikolai.  Our son.    Our what?   Oh, so remember that little something I wanted to tell you? A little something? Oh, that is just classic you.    So I\'m a little late.    A lot late.  No one could have survived that.  Oh, man! Whoo! I am awesome! Ugh.  And it just keeps on getting better.    Lana?   Asshole? Oh, my God.  Was that not epic?   First of all   Nikolai, look, they\'re alive.    Oh, thank God.    Thank God? For what? The lying woman I risk my career for? The son she don\'t told me of? Or maybe my damn security deposit? Security deposit.  What was it, a pair of flip flops?   Half the bounty.  Come on, I deserve it.    Ha! Too bad.  So you can just paddle that hole in your foot right on back to your cheesy, Mexican kitchen Oh, I\'ll get a new kitchen.  Let\'s see you get a new boyfriend after I have a talk with Cyril.  Ha! About what, exactly? How you cried during a two man threesome? Wooden spoons are a huge emotional trigger for me, Lana.  Yeah, and now I know.  And when I tell Pam so will everybody in the office.    Oh, is that how you wanna play it?   Yeah.  Fine! Keep your stupid bounty, then! And keep your pathetic, clingy boyfriend.  I will.  Oh, and Cyril may be clingy, but at least I know I can trust him.    Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Cyril, come on.  Snap out of it, seriously.  It\'s not like we burned down the mainframe.  You really need to relax.  How? My life is ruined.  Again.  Look, what happens on this scratchy green office rug stays on this scratchy green office rug, okay? You mean this, what we just did, you\'ll keep this our secret? Yeah.  God, Cyril.  You can trust me.  You know, probably.  Probably? Womp womp.All aboard, for safety and adventure! On the rigid airship Excelsior  where the pampered luxury of a cruise ship  meets the smoothness of modern air travel.  Yes, when you fly Excelsior, you\'re flying in style!   And safety! Safety?   But isn\'t hydrogen flammable?   And how, Timmy! That\'s why Excelsior is filled with safe  natural helium.  Why, it\'s actually flame retardant!   Neat!   And safe! So, whether you\'re enjoying Excelsior\'s majestic vistas  duty free shopping, high stakes baccarat  dancing with your lovely wife  or even a cigar after a French gourmet dinner  you\'ll be enjoying them in style.  And safety!   All aboard Excelsior! God.  Who\'d wanna put a bomb on that? That\'s what we\'re hoping ISIS can find out.  No, why bother? Some broad gets on there with a staticky sweater, and boom, it\'s: "Oh, the humanity!"   No, no, that   Sterling.  Were you watching some other commercial just now? It\'s a rigid airship.    Filled with helium.    Which is non flammable! Dumb ass.  I thought our promotional video covered that fairly well.  Oh, and how.  Sterling, it\'s totally safe.  Well, except for the bomb threat.  No, not to worry, dear.  ISIS won\'t let terrorists blow up your lovely blimp.    Rigid airship.    My top two agents will be on board.    Nope!   And I will oversee the operation personally from what I assume will be first class accommodations.  Oh, actually we are fully booked.  Well, if you think, oh, I don\'t know this "Trudy Beekman" person can thwart a major terror plot.  I suppose we could bump Mrs.  Beekman.    Bump me, I\'m not going.    Lf these two share a cabin.    Nope!   Not going to let the terrorists win!   We\'ll pose as husband and wife!   Nope! Cyril would totally freak.  Malory, let me stay with you.  We\'ll do the whole Oprah Gayle thing.  Nope! I need a stateroom to myself in case I have a gentleman caller.    Um   Mother, please.    Please do not make me do this.    But Lana think of the innocent lives you\'ll be saving.  And also the fact that this is a direct order.  At least tell me it\'s separate beds.    Um Hmm.  Ugh.  Lana.  Lana.  Lana!   Lana!   What? Danger zone! Terrible, awful, just gut wrenchingly bad feeling about this.  Baby, I really need you to trust me.  Okay, now is the cabin small? Yes.  And yet surprising amount of storage.    Ugh.  And I\'ll hardly be in here, okay? I\'ve got a terrorist to find, and I doubt he\'s hiding under   What\'s basically a twin bed.    Archer.  Since it\'s all drawers under here, because look how tiny this room is!   Oh, my God, it\'s like a broom closet.    And yet, a surprising amount of storage.  Oh, shut up, and Cyril?   Very eager to know why you\'re still here.    He was just   Just helping Lana get settled.    Trust me, Cyril.  She already settled.    Hey!   Hey! Disembark, Cyril.  We\'re about to launch, or whatever blimps do.  Yeah, what does a blimp do, Pam? Uh Kick your skinny ass? Now come on, we gotta get off this thing before Relax! God, we\'ve got half an hour.  Oh.  Well then, make me a double Campari and, uh I guess vodka?   We don\'t normally drink on the bridge.    Well, I don\'t normally fly on the Hindenburg 2. 0.    It\'s not Cyril doesn\'t normally storm off without even kissing me goodbye! We\'re all out of our comfort zone.    Not me, my stateroom is gorgeous.    Oh.  That, what\'s her name, Beekman? I bet she\'s just sick she got bumped.  Yes, she literally vomited from anger.  So if we could just focus on the bomb threat? How about crew members?   Anyone who might be disgruntled?   Um That\'s Lieutenant Krauss.  He and I were both up for command of the Excelsior, but You got it.  Leaving him with motive.  Release the mooring cable! Come on! It\'s not Larry Luftwaffe, that\'s Oopsie.  Ha ha ha.    Ugh, way too obvious.  God damn it! We\'re moving!   I know!   What happened to half an hour?   I lied!   What? Why the hell are you two still here? Because I knew you\'d be here, because you don\'t trust Lana with Mr.  Archer.  No! No, now that is   So ironic, Cyril! Ugh.    Especially in light of recent No.  rug burny events.    Oh, my God! You two banged? L Uh See, here\'s the thing   Fruit basket!   Wow.  You are just a dog in a manger.  I don\'t know what that means, Pam.    I didn\'t grow up on a cheese farm.    Oh, for the It\'s called a dairy.  Even a hint of a problem on our maiden voyage would kill Excelsior\'s stock price.  So, Lana, canvas the passengers and crew learn what you can about Krauss   But please, be discreet! Hey, good advice! Which maybe I\'ll just sort of fold in with my 12 years of experience as a covert operative.  Don\'t be snotty.  And Sterling, if there is a bomb Captain, dear, where would it do the most damage?   Probably in   This new place called anywhere?   This whole thing\'s a bomb.  Jesus!   It\'s not   Wanna blow us all to shit, Sherlock?   Ow!   Sterling!   For the last time the Excelsior is filled with non flammable helium! Although this is a non smoking area, sir.  Damn it, he\'s a prospective investor! Not after that, I bet.  And forget about Krauss.  There\'s your bomber.    Who? What? That guy.  Beardsley McTurbanhead.  You idiot.  That\'s Sandu Singh, the billionaire investor!   He\'s a Sikh!   Oh, so if he\'s not a Muslim he just gets a pass? That\'s called profiling, Mother, and I don\'t do it.    Singh is Excelsior\'s majority shareholder.    So? If anything went wrong on this flight, he\'d lose millions.    It\'s a perfect cover.    Sterling.  Just look for the stupid bomb.  Relax.  What do we have, like, four hours before we get to London?   Sterling, are you joking?   The crossing takes 24 hours.    Are you joking? What?   Rigid airships combine the pampering of a cruise ship with the speed of   Some other, slightly faster ship? Uh Hello, airplanes? Yeah, it\'s blimps.  You win, bye! Oh, God.    I hope you didn\'t invest in this.    It\'ll be fine, though.  As long as nothing goes wrong on this flight.  Oh, captain, my captain with ISIS on board, what could possibly go wrong? Pick one! Either A, I tell Lana what happened on that scratchy green office rug or two, you get inside me.  Or C, maybe I just jam this mop into the engine and kill all of us.    I don\'t think that\'s how blimps work.    Darn, right.  We\'d just sort of float around.  Stupid naturally safe helium! But I am liking the jamming imagery.    And the killing.    And are you just gonna sit there? Yeah, until she tags me in!   What?   I\'m kidding! My back\'s all messed up.  So you\'re ruining Cyril\'s life because in your "dream the impossible dream" world, it\'ll make Mr.  Archer jealous? Oh, Pamela.  You read me like a poem.  Yeah? What\'s the poem gonna be about when Cyril snaps and murders you? I don\'t know.  World\'s gushiest orgasm? Can you just get out of the way!   What, are you gonna shoot me again?   Yes! Oh.  Well, then hang on.  Cyril\'s already freaked out enough about us sharing this shoebox without you air drying your unkempt bush.  Unkempt bush? You\'re one to talk.  Ah.  My vulva is smoother than a veal cutlet.    With terrible timing.    Oh, really.    Baby   Did I interrupt something? Oh Rehearsal with your Commodores tribute band? Archer! Cyril, what are you doing here? I wanted to tell you something very important but apparently you\'re too busy showing off your vealy vulva! Cyril! You know, your whole trust thing, and I\'ve tried to, okay? Okay, you know what? We are on a break!   Oh, yeah? Yeah!   Well, that\'s fine by me.    Cyril, wait.  No running! Shut up.    Oh, my God, what have l   What\'re you doing? Go after him!   Oh.  You think I should?   Yes! We\'re almost out of fruit.  Which is why I find it strange that you\'re so incredibly calm.  Well, that seaweed wrap just slurps out the stress.  Can\'t wait to tell Trudy Beekman all about it.  Lf, um, we ever meet.    What about you? Anything on Krauss?   No.  Shut up.    Have you seen Cyril?   What? Why would I have?   And what the hell is he doing?   Hey!   What\'d I tell you, huh? Huh?   Ow! Uhn! There! Go buy a nicotine patch!   Gentlemen.    No, no, no, what happened to discretion?   What happened to that bartender?   Right? Guy sees an empty glass and all of a sudden he\'s Judge Crater.    Oh, for God\'s sake! Nigel, some chips for mister? Archer.  Ha.  Sterling Archer.  The minimum bet is ten thousand, sir.  Dollars.  I stuffed all my money in that guy\'s mouth, because Well, perhaps we could play for something much more interesting.  Yeah, cause that was seriously, like, all the cash I had on me, so.  So if I win, I spend a night of passion with your exquisite wife.    My wi? Oh, yes, my wife, of course.    Oh! Yeah, that\'s a deal! But if I win you tell me where the bomb What?   Baccarat! Mr.  Singh wins.    Wait, wait, wait, we were going?   The von Zeppelin suite.  I shall expect her within the hour.  She\'s not gonna be happy about that.  Um What, are you mostly paid in tips?   Almost entirely, sir.    Heh.  Ahem.  Mm hm.  Well, whose fault is that? Prancing around in your Fiacci knockoffs blathering about your vulva.    Hey, first of all I\'m just saying! You\'re driving Cyril straight toward another woman.  Cyril? With another woman? Malory, seriously.  Look at me.  Look at me! Look at and choke me!   Oh, yes, yes! Oh, my God!   Oh, my God, what am I doing?   Ruining your life, you idiot.    Ha ha ha.  And making it hard to drop a deuce.    Uh I\'m sorry, what?   You.  Now.  Led Zeppelin suite.  You have no proof Singh\'s the bomber.    He hinted   That\'s profiling.  that the proof was in his cabin!   Really? Yes! So go down there and find it while I go find the bomb.    Ugh.  Bombs, bombers, vulvas.    You people are just ruining my trip.  Uh Well, don\'t stand here gaping at me! Go thwart something!   No running!   Zip it, Zipperface! Oh.  Kidding, sorry.  Hey, have you seen that nerdy fruit basket steward? Check the Kaiser Wilhelm suite.  You really need new names on Hey, what were you doing in there? Things for authorized personnel only! So don\'t go in there.  It\'s verboten! Ah.  Okay.  Probably merits a follow up.  Archer?   Cyril? What\'re you? Archer, I need your help! I think I\'m losing it here, man! What gave it away, my mother\'s? Why are you wearing my mother\'s robe?   I can explain.    I don\'t think I want you to.    See, it all started when you and Lana   Cyril! You should tell her this.  I tried! But you were naked and it was all vulva this, and vulva that.  Yeah, and as you\'re standing here, dick and or balls caressed by my mother\'s robe, ugh Lana is waiting for you.    Really? Where? The Led Zeppelin suite.    There\'s a von Zeppelin suite.    Which I\'m sure is what I meant.  So, go!   Thanks, Archer! You\'re the best!   I know.  So yes, the bottom line is that I was unfaithful to you.  Two Well, three times, I guess, if a dry humpy choker counts.  And if you can\'t see it in your heart to forgive me I will forgive you.  Because that\'s what love is, Lana.  It\'s forgivey.  Which is not a word.  Come on, Figgis! All right, here we go.    Oh, why?   Hello!   So, that\'s your idea of a break, huh?   Cyril! It\'s not what it looks like! Well, then, what is it? Okay, so Cyril got in over his head.    Jesus, God, did he kill her? No, no, no, he ran from her! To go confess to Lana but so then this one starts freaking out, and long story short I kinda had to drown her in the tub.    So you killed her? Apparently not, so good news.  Shut up, Pam.  Did Cyril run by here crying in a woman\'s bathrobe? Well, it wouldn\'t surprise me.  You\'re driving him stark raving mad.    What\'d I do?   What\'d you do? Running around all up and down this stupid blimp.    Against the rules.    Half naked, tits bouncing around like you\'re at a rodeo, then going back to some billionaire\'s suite?   I was trying to stop a bomb plot.    Oh, my God, there is no bomb!   More good news.    And just how do you know that? Ugh.  Because I made the bomb threat! Trudy Beekman booked the very last ticket on this flight, so it was all: "Meh, meh, meh.  I\'m Trudy Beekman.  I\'m on the co op board and I\'m going on a blimp! Meh!"   So, yes, I made a phony bomb threat.    Good for you.  And yet you lecture me.  Lovely.  Hello?   So, what would you say if I told you that your mother made a phony bomb threat just to get a free ride on a blimp?   I\'d say that\'s fairly classic her?   Oh, shut up.    And then I\'d just sorta laugh at the, uh The whatchamacallit.  Irony.  There\'s actually a bomb on board? Archer? Archer? Oh, what the hell? Where the **** are you going? Gotta get my turtleneck.  I\'m not defusing a bomb in this!   No running! Shut up! Oh, and Lana, maybe you ought to grab the Kraut.  He\'s the bomber.  What is this? You know what it is, Fritz!   So shut your schnitzel hole and disarm it.    Oh.  I get it.  The German guy mit a scar must be the bad guy.  Well, you know how I got this scar? Saving a Jewish girl from a gang of skinheads.    Oh, Jesus.    Yeah! And so Krauss gets a curb party.    Wow.  Now I feel like an asshole.    Your words.  But could you be a lamb and disarm it anyway? Yeah, probably.  Okay, got the turtleneck and my wire cutters.  Now where are we? We\'re at you just shot the guy who could disarm the bomb, jackass! What? I didn\'t shoot him!   You think I\'d bring a gun on this firetrap?   Then who did it?   I did! Captain Lammers! Nice read, Velma.  "Keep your 401 K in company stock," they said.  "The price can only go up," they said!   Well, guess what!   Um, it didn\'t? Who the hell wants a two day blimp ride to London?   Which is our only route!   Okay, so it\'s a niche market, but Blowing it up will send the stock price down to zero.  Yeah, that\'s why I shorted it!   But what about all the other employees?   Um   See? It\'s that kinda selfish shit   Lana, no! You\'ll kill us all! For the last time, you idiot! It\'s not hydrogen it\'s helium! And what about that are you still not getting, exactly? Well, obviously the core concept, Lana! Sorry, I didn\'t go to Space Camp.  How about bomb defusal camp? No, actually lacrosse camp.  If that helps.  I mean, a lot of those skills are universal.    Shut up.  Agent Gillette, please.    Oh, great.  Come on people, talk to me! What are we thinking? What are we doing?   What are we wearing?   My crisis vest.  Mr.  Fatface.    Lana? Hey, girl, are you there?   Yeah, I\'m Hey, can you see me?   I see your knockoff Fiacci drawers.    Ha ha.  You are such a bitch.    Hey, Ray.    Ugh.    Let\'s see that ignition, girl.  You got it? East German crap, probably a GK 31 or 32.  So on the side of the timer, there should be a serial number.  That\'ll tell me which wire y\'all need to cut.  Got it?   Yeah, I see it! Ready?   Since first call.    Nine, three, four T, X, S.    T X X? Two X\'s? X  S! Like INXS! N X X? Jesus, use the NATO phonetic alphabet!   The what? Duh.  Christ on sale, is it S? Sierra! Ray it\'s niner three four, Tango, X ray, Sierra! Thank you, doll! Now there should be a dash, followed by two letters.    Okay.    Okay, so now I want you to cut the blue and white wire.    Which one? There\'s two of those.    No One\'s blue with a white stripe  and the other\'s white with a blue stripe.    Yeah, and both are identical!   No! They\'re not! Ray? Hon? They\'re really similar.  One\'s a teeny bit Blue, honey.    Which one?   I guess that one, maybe?   So wait, which one do I cut?   The teeny bit Blue one! Okay!   O K?   Wait! Stop!   What? You said the letters after the dash were Oscar Kilo!   Who?   What?   O K! Oscar Kilo!   No, "Okay!" Like: "Okay, now I\'m gonna tell you what they are!"   Then you didn\'t!   I thought we skipped that part!   Skipped a step in disarming a bomb?   Which I thought was pretty irresponsible on your part.    Why do you always do this?   Why do you always not shut up?   Stop.    On the radio when we answer in the affirmative we say, "Roger. "   Roger.  Sorry.  Ray.    Now.  In the serial number what are the two letters following the dash?   You ready? God damn it, Archer!   First letter is B.    Bravo.  Thanks, second letter is N.  M as in Mike, or N as   As in Nancy! God, you of all people.    What? Archer!   Me of all people?   Nothing.    Ray, hon.    Okay.    Oh, so you can say okay?   Oh, my God.    Ray, can I shoot him? In about five seconds, honey.  Lana, be careful! Jesus, the helium! Right after he cuts the solid green wire.    The green color is solid, or? Roger.  Oh.  Roger.  Cutting the green wire.  Archer!   Jesus, God! What? That\'s how annoying you are.    Your mom\'s annoying! How about that?   Let\'s go there.  Let\'s go here! Where Archer shut up and cut the goddamn wire already! You shut up and I\'m doing it! God!   Oh, my Ray! What\'s going on?   The timer sped up!   Did you cut the green one?   Yes! Roger! Steven! Whoever!   Ray!   What were the last two letters? B.    As in butt hole.    What do we do here? And M! As in Mancy! What?   M as in what?   Mancy! What\'d you think I said?   Nancy! You idiot! Oh, yeah! I can see how Then I was like "You of all"   Exact! Same! Spot!   Ray? Ray? Tell me what to do! So do you all have parachutes? No!   That would be, you know, problem solved.    Ray!   I don\'t know.  Push it off with your big ass hands.  Good luck, honey.    It\'s too heavy!   Archer?   Aah! Aah! Aah!   I can not do this alone!   You\'re not alone! Baby! You came back to me! Well, I really Lana, there\'s a lot you and I need to talk about.  And let\'s do that.  Right after we shove this huge bomb off the blimp!   Okay, but then we seriously need to   Cyril!   Sorry, here we go.  Lana! We\'re not gonna make it!   Yes, we are, Cyril! We are gonna make it.    Ha.  Oh, my God! Lana, we made it!   Oh.  Hooray for metaphors.  I told you.  Ha ha.  Okay, now then.    What did you want to talk about?   Um Well, uh, a lot of stuff, really.  Starting with the fact we just bombed Ireland.  Um Pretty sure that\'s Wales.Shh! Shh!   Ugh.  Why the hell is your phone on?   Because I have a social life.    Hello? Why the hell is your phone on? Because I have a Why did you call?   Because this is important.    Micromanagitis.  If we show San Marino the flaws in their palace security  they\'ve agreed to hire us as security consultants.  And I\'m sure I don\'t need to remind you that we haven\'t gotten one of these jobs since your Uffizi fiasco.  And yet, you always do.  Because you learned nothing from it.  I learned that flammable and inflammable mean the same thing.    Wait, what?   Well, this time make sure you Mother.  Oh, my God, we\'ve been spotted they\'re shooting at us.  Oh, my   Heh.  Bet she\'s freaking out right now.    Oh, my God.  What shade is that? Crack Whore Red?   You said they were tranquilizer darts.    Ah, I merely implied that.  Damn it.  So I poisoned like, five innocent security guards? Would you relax? I\'m pretty sure San Marino has universal health care.    So?   So that\'s good for them.  Because there\'s gonna be some neurological damage.    Oh, my.  Lana.    Wow, that is one serious diamond.  But is it supposed to be brown? It\'s not brown, Pam.    That color is called champagne.    Mm hm.    And why do you have it?   Because I am gonna ask Lana to marry me.  And you\'re gonna give her that if she says no? Like a big "screw you in your big Lincoln Loggy fingers"? The last thing you hear me say is, "Oh, my God, they\'re shooting at us" and you don\'t even call me back?   Well I knew you weren\'t in any real danger.  You know, with Lana there.    Ha!   Ha.  And let\'s just knock off the giggling.  I want game faces on those heads for our conference call with the prince.    I thought he was a captain regent.    Oh, whatever.  All of San Marino could fit in the South Bronx.    The important thing is, they\'re loaded.    Just shitfaced.    Oh   About 15 freaking beers all that Schtzie.  And holy shit, did I honk down a bunch of absinthe? I don\'t know Pam, but could you lower your voice? I must have.  Cause I hallucinated you had an engagement Not.  Another.  Word.    And just what is this, I ask you.    Hello, Cheryl.  Cyril.  Are you cheating on me?   No, just trying to get my muffin back.    Oh, no, you\'re not.    I\'m not?   Not like that.  You gotta slug her in the diaphragm with a forearm shiver.    Oh.  That\'s good to know.  Heh.    Do it.  Um   Wow.    Ugh.  And no muffin.  See? Time lost is muffin lost.  Along with my appetite.    For food, that is.  Heh heh.    Ugh.  Come see me.  Wow.  I am incredibly sorry.  But that is my decision, Ms.  Archer.    And as captain regent of   I don\'t care if you\'re Captain Crunch.  No, wait, Beefheart.    We had a deal.    Kangaroo.  Remember him? We pointed out every single flaw in your cut rate security system.  And now not only are you hiring another agency you won\'t even pay ISIS for that security probe.  Which means no bonuses for us.    Wait, what?   Oh, now he cares.  Those monies will go to medical care for the palace guards they poisoned.    What?   Lana did that.    And as for hiring ODIN   ODIN?   Uh, skipper, if I could jump in here.    Trexler.  Oh, Malory.  Even on What is this, 1080p? You look just as supple  and sexy as the day I first laid eyes on you.    Where, in a wax museum?   Sterling!   That\'s no way to talk to your mother.    Just who the hell do you think you are?   Getting ISIS blacklisted at the UN?   Had nothing to do with that.    Embarrassing me in Berlin?   The entire hotel was embarrassed.  Stealing all my prospective clients?   Yeah.    And no matter which way I turn you\'re butting in that big, fat, strong aquiline nose of yours.    Wait, what?   You said it was the nose of a Caesar.    Ehh Well, perhaps a lesser Caesar.  No, no, now, I clearly remember you said Augustus.    And in vino veritas.    The Chianti was definitely flowing.    Ha, ha.    Among other things.    Mother.    Hmm? Oh, uh this is the last time you make me out a fool, Len Trexler.    You wanna play me hard?   Phrasing.    You know I do.    Well, then you better nut up.    Phrasing.    Because I\'ve swallowed just about as much as I can take from you.    Hey! Phrasing! And we\'ll see who\'s smirking when ISIS steals that diamond for real.    Oh, you\'re a naughty girl.    Right, then.  Commence Operation "Rub Len Trexler\'s Big Fat Nose In It. "   Sounds like you already have.    You want to break back into the palace which now has the insane amount of security we recommended?   Plus God knows how many ODIN guys.    Yes, so take more of that poison.  And on top of that suck salad you wanna sprinkle on the bacon bits of "Let\'s tell them we\'re coming"?   Well?   Well, there\'s this new thing called the element of surprise? I\'m so sorry I slammed you in the gut.  Jeez, that\'s how Houdini died.    Houdini died of AIDS.    No.  Why do you always say that? And that\'s the thing.    I want to surprise Lana   Well, you nailed it.  So this time I need you to not be your normal compulsively blabby self.  Wha? When have I ever been blabby? Guess who has breast cancer.  Just one of like, two dozen equally appalling videos on your website.  They\'re not all equally appal   And have I blabbed about you and Cheryl?   She keeps seducing me.  And you think you can make that unhappen if you give Lana a tiny flake of brown mica?   Cyril, look at it.    But I spent two months\' salary.    I know.  But you make shit.    Hey, I\'m doing pretty well, thank you.  Save that speech for the father you continually disappoint.  I\'m head of HR, Cyril, I know your take home.  Yeah, and l I I take home shit.  Well, we all do.  What\'s my father ever done that\'s so great? School superintendent? Big whoop.  There\'s only like 800 kids in the entire county.  K through 12!   Wow.    I\'m sorry, you were saying? I were saying, we all make shit, so, what we should do is unionize.  Yeah.  I\'ll get the raise I deserve.    Then you can buy Lana a big boy ring.    She\'ll promptly agree to marry me.  Then you take her home to meet your dick dad.  And then I shove his hawk face right into her big brown boobs and scream, "Look at those babies, old man.  Didn\'t need a varsity letter to get those, did I? So now who\'s a disappoint?" Oh, Jesus H.  Jones, Pam.  What? Carol? Carol? Oh, wait.  Cheryl? Cheryl.  Hello? Cheryl, I swear to God if I have to open my own salad again I will freak out.  Where the hell is everybody? Let\'s assume we can\'t access the palace through that same skylight.    Okay.    But maybe we overlooked an air shaft or maybe even some access below grade?   So let\'s pull up the palace schematics.    Uh, okay.    Maybe today, if that works for you.    Hang on.    Let me see.  How about now? Anything?   No.    Uh, how about now?   No.    How about now? Anything?   No.    What are you doing there?   I don\'t know.    What, are you just hitting random keys?   Well, obviously.  Aw, damn it, we Where is the hobbit guy?   Heh.  A freaking hobbit works here?   No.  He\'s just a They\'re called little people, not hobbits.    Will you He\'s a hobbit enthusiast.    Ooh.  But he also knows how to work all the computers and satellites and shit.  But even though I do all that I gotta live with a roommate.  In Queens.  That\'s disgusting.    Thanks, Bilbo.  Another example of how underpaid the ISIS support staff really is.  And I for one am fed up.  Yeah, fed full of muffins and denial.  What\'s your problem, neck bones? My problem is I remember what Ms.  Archer did to the cleaning ladies.  You sure, missus? Is plenty space.  No.  Gracias.  Okay.  Ha.  How\'s that for bread and roses? That was pretty sad.  What\'s sad is now nobody re stocks the machine in the bathroom so I have to make my own tampons.  I don\'t know what that is.  That\'s where my yarn\'s going.  Exactly, and so I say, no union.  Yes, confederacy forever.  No, wait, uh uh.  Don\'t listen to the makes her own tampons person.  Listen to your hearts.  Because deep down you know they\'re exploiting us.  But if we unite, we can put a stop to it.  And that supply closet is just packed with posterboard and markers, and maybe even some glitter.  So who\'s with me on that picket line?   And me.    Really? You had me at "put. " Yes, we need a sound sensor.  Duh! Where is that equipment guy? And where the hell are the jumars? Yeah, I don\'t know, this was all I could find.  I\'m thinking goggles, yes.  Shovels I don\'t know how or why we\'d use them.    Ugh.  Cheryl?   She\'s not in here.    Well, why are you in here? Is the San Marino diamond in here now? It might be, for all we know.  We can\'t find any gear we need.  We\'ve got no sat coms, no new intel and so basically we are totally unprepared for this mission.    Unless it involves night shoveling.    Well, I want that diamond.  Not to mention my rapidly approaching  room temperature Cobb salad, so Damn it, where the hell are all the drones? What do we want? Unfair! When do we want it? Change! Okay, so they\'re bad chanters, but overall this strike\'s shaping up.    How? Nobody knows why we\'re striking.    Well, we can\'t say "Hey, right upstairs is a top secret intelligence agency. " But it looks like we\'re picketing the cleaners.    No, it doesn\'t.    Jesus! Stop picketing the cleaners! You were saying?   Why are people picketing the cleaners?   I predicted this.  It\'s curry fury.  Holy shit, is that Cyril? And Pam, Krieger, Carol.  All the Drones.  They\'re not picketing the cleaners, they\'re picketing ISIS.    What\'s their beef?   Oh, the same entitled crap as always.  "I can\'t make ends meet," "I\'m on food stamps. " "My child died because I couldn\'t afford new bone marrow. "   Just me, me, me.    Jesus, whose kid died? Oh, who remembers.  Check Pam\'s blog.  And done, but if you still want us to steal you that gigantic diamond   Well, obviously.    We\'re gonna have to cross their picket line.    Screw that.    Yeah, what\'s with all the bottles? It\'s like a trailer park Easter.  Lousy commies! Go back to Quebec! Jesus.  Okay, strike\'s over, everybody.  No, hold that line.  We deserve a raise and Lana deserves a real ring, so Okay, so let\'s go out the back.    Oh, my God.    Ha, ha!   Happy Easter, Cyril.    Lana? Oh, baby.  What happened to you?   Well, see, I wanted to buy you a   Cyril.    This is not that moment.    And we don\'t talk to management.    Or ham fisted whores.    What?   Hmm?   Yeah, no, they\'re right.    What?   No, not the whore part.  Management.  We\'re not technically management.  But you make shitloads more than we do.  Even though you totally depend on us.  On you? Hey, we\'re out there risking our lives every   Many of the days.    And so, yes, we get paid a little more.    How much a little more?   Well, it\'s complicated.    No, it isn\'t, don\'t answer that.    What with salary performance incentives, bonuses   Bonuses?   Dump her, Cyril.  Hey, crazy.  Go macrame some tampons.  Oh, you wanna hear something crazy? Cyril   Thank you, Pam.  Now look, Lana   Baby, "Take Charge" Cyril is totally doing it for me, it really is, but we\'re on a vital mission here.    Vital mission?   Not on the master clipboard.    So just how vital is it? It\'s incredibly vital.  Because if they don\'t steal me that huge diamond I will literally die.    A diamond?   In this economy?   You\'re stealing a diamond? For her?   Oh, irony.    And the rest of you, back to work.  If that salad isn\'t open in the next   Get them!   Oh, oh!   Hey, whoa.    Stop surging.  Archer, do something.  I am doing something.  What are you doing? Lana, out the back.  Move.  Hey, Cyril.  Cyril.    Cyril! What? I\'m saving Lana.  As usual.  Hey, shut up.  Freaking ODIN.  I can\'t believe this.  How many are there? About a jillion.  Damn it.    A jillion gay little copycats.    What? I didn\'t invent the turtleneck, Lana.  But I was the first to recognize its potential as a tactical garment.    The tactical turtleneck, Lana.    Archer.  The Tactleneck.    Can you please focus?   Not really.  Don\'t think these goggles were properly calibrated.  Ditto the sound sensor.  And the stupid code cloner.  All the gear those sweaty tech dweebs normally Oh!   Do we take the drones for granted?   No.  No, no, Lana.  Do not make this about them.  No, no, no.  That is utterly unacceptable.    It\'s just a cost of living adjustment.  It\'s strong arm robbery.  Come on, Ms.  Archer.  You\'ve been in there ten hours.  Meet us halfway, and Krieger will let you out of there.    Or else he\'ll crank up the heat again.  I love that you know how to do that.    And I love that I have an erection that didn\'t involve homeless people.  And you\'re cool with Krieger shucking your side corn? Yeah, that is a huge win win for me.  You hear that, Ms.  Archer? We\'re all on board for the big win win out here.  Well, I\'m not.  Do your worst, Krieger.    Okay.    Oh, my God, yes.  Yes, go ahead.  Crank up the heat.  I\'m as naked as the day I was born.  Oh, yes.  That is not something   Naked or not.    Well, don\'t keep saying it.  You can\'t stay in there forever.  Ha! I\'ll outlast you.  I\'m naked and I\'ve got half a lime and almost nearly two thirds of a half gallon of Shit.    Now we got her.  Ha! I\'ll suck it straight off this grimy linoleum before I give in to you belly achers.    You\'ve got nothing!   No code cloner, no GPS.  Argh!   We\'ve got no thermal imaging.    Lana we don\'t need gadgets.    Really? Machines are gonna fail.  Then the system\'s gonna fail and then it\'s "Who has the ability to survive?" And that\'s the game, Lana.  Survival.  Just watched Deliverance again, huh? I mean, is Burt Reynolds not the man in that? On the raft? With the vest?   Huh? You know he did all his own stunts.    I know!   Shh!   He did his own stunts! Keep your freaking voice Aah! God! Sweet Jesus, the goggles! Intruders.  Get them.    Aah, Lana! Lana, I\'m blind.  I\'m blind.    Yeah? Should I go on without you? What? No, carry me, monster hands.  Ow, ow, ow! Jesus.  Quit bouncing my eyes.  Shut up.  I\'m trying to get us an evac but nobody\'s answer Oh, holy shit, are they still on strike? Hey, Eugene Debs, it\'s only been about ten hours.    All right?   So you\'d rather die in there than give us a cost of living adjustment? Yes.    Well, I can arrange that.  Crunch! I love that you know how to do that.  Well, now you\'re trapped.  Happy? Yes.    Ugh! Laundry.  Oh, wait, are we open? What? Sir, you have to slow Jeezy Petes, get a load of this guy.  We\'re taking heavy fire and we need an extraction, dumb ass! Lana? Ha! She thought you were a man.  Shut up.  Cyril, baby  we\'re pinned down, okay? We need a Aah!   Lana! What\'s going on? We need evac.  A helo, a jump jet.  At this point, really anything.  Don\'t just stand there, idiots.    Yeah, come on.  Get them out of there.  Uh, we need the sat com link to do that.    So?   So it\'s upstairs.  And, uh, someone broke the elevator.  And Miss Fire Hazard in there bricked up the only stairwell.  Don\'t talk to me about fire hazards.    All you people did in there was smoke.  Oh, God, I\'m hit.  Lana!   Will somebody please do something? Like what, Cyril? I\'m blind.    No, us.  Here.  Oh.    Krieger, Bilbo.  Come on, can\'t you guys do something? Wha? No.  Oh, wait, I meant yes.  Roger that, Zebra Two.  Stand by.  Helo\'s 10 4, just needs you to upload their GPS coordinates into his HUD.  Which I will do with these cell phones.  Holy shit, you geeks are bad ass.  We couldn\'t have done it without an electrical insulator.  So thank Cyril for the tiny brown diamond.  What? Wait, did we get the diamond? What? No.  But Cyril, why did you have a diamond? Oh, uh, just my ear stud.  You know, from college.  Really? Called it.  And, again, you do realize it\'ll be totally destroyed in the process.  Yes, just hurry up.  Please.  Okay, uploading GPS coordinates.    Wait a second.  Damn it, we don\'t have a second.  Lana, I\'m sure we have one second.  But seriously, it does sound like we\'re about to be overrun, so Get my son out of there.  What the hell are you people waiting for?   A goddamn cost of living adjustment.  What?   Hey, yeah.    No!   Krieger, this is not the time for this.    It is exactly the time.  So, what\'s it gonna be, you harpy? You ever wanna see your son again? Not at the number you quoted me.  Mother!   That number is pegged to the consumer price index.  Where? The People\'s Republic of Canada? Jesus, take it out of our bonuses.  What? Mother, no, listen to me.  Aah! I\'m hit.  I\'m hit and I\'m blind.  Jesus, Ms.  Archer, your child is dying.  Oh, all right.  If they\'ll give up their bonuses Mother! You can have your lousy cost of living adjustment.  Something good\'s happening.  And you can have your dick son back.  What\'s going on? I hear a helicopter.    Oh, yeah.  Holy shit my other senses are already heightened.    Hey, this time I saved Lana.    But Oh, God, Pam.  Two months\' salary.    Cyril.  You can\'t put a price on good pussy.  Roger that, Zebra Two.  Hey, the helo\'s got them.  They\'re safe.  Hooray.  Way to go.  Then get me out of this sweat box! Because I am officially out of gin.  Oh, come on, Archer, not now, I\'m serious.  Hey, I\'m serious! Look at me, seriously, Lana.  Forget the eye bandage, but the hair, the strong jaw line.    Who do I remind you of?   Nobody.    Say it.    Don\'t make me do that.    Say it.  Say it!   Ugh.  Burt Reynolds in Deliverance.  No! Not in Deliverance.  Ha, ha.    In Gator.    Ugh.  Right? How can you not see that?Because this is what was there, Lana! There, where? Outside a clown college?   They have those here?   I don\'t know! Archer, look out!   We\'ll never catch him!   You should have thought about that before you blew the damn drop!   I blew jack shit!   Name dropper.  And if you weren\'t so busy trying to bang that waitress you\'d have noticed that ODIN had agents in play! She was the hostess! If you weren\'t blinded by jealousy   Yes, I\'m jealous.    First step\'s admitting it.  Jealous that ODIN\'s gonna beat us again thanks to your epic poon houndery!   First of all   Oh! Oh, my God.    Great, good job.  Shut up! ODIN doesn\'t beat Sterling Archer.  Only Sterling Archer beats Did you wanna finish that? Did you wanna finish shutting your big fat, negative wordsy mouth? Whose fat mouth told the stupid waitress he was an ISIS agent? Hostess.  And I had a plan.    What, to get laid in the walk in?   Also.  Because I\'m not an ant, Lana.    I happen to see the big picture.    Oh, really? Well, then where\'s Kasparov? Okay, that was a fluke.  Ha, ha.  Yeah, a fluke of nature.  Because I happen to have perfect situational awareness, Lana.    Archer.    Which cannot be taught, by the way.  Archer.    Like a poet\'s mind for   Archer.    Archer!   To make the perfect word.    Archer!   Goddamn it, I\'m relishing the   Ow.  Way to go, Lana.  Nice warning.    Nice relishing.  Ow.    Oh.  Think that was ODIN?   No, it\'s only you that beats you, buddy.  Hey, gang.  Barry.  Gee, thanks for helping us catch Kasparov.    ODIN appreciates the assist.  Yeah.  And if you ever get tired of playing JV ball you know where to find us.    Oh, yeah, uh, where\'s that? Um, dick town? Ha, ha.  Jesus, even their cards are nice.  Lana, look at this.  It\'s embossed.  Oh, okay.  Then, I guess, just pout.    That was the mayor of Paris   Name dropper.    Who was just as eager as I am to know why ISIS agents were terrorizing Paris!   So I crashed a few cop cars ran over a few mimes! So I don\'t play by the rules, Mother, but I get results! Well, as long as you got Kasparov.  Oh, uh, yeah, about that That\'s why she can\'t have nice things.    Either that or I steal them.  What?   Hm? What\'s that? Hm? What do you want? I\'m a little busy for chitchat.    Busy trying to turn that thing on?   Look at this!   O N.  Nothing.    Well, just keep at it.    You\'re not my supervisor! I\'m sorry, what? He sort of offered me a job at ODIN.    Barry Dillon?   Uh Barry "We have this whole huge history together" Dillon? We don\'t have this whole huge history.    Oh.  Oh, my God.  Barry.    Oh, yeah, right.  Pretty sweet, huh? Using a mirror to reflect the laser beam back into the laser?   Oh, my God!   Yeah, sorry, it took so long.    And that I\'m accidentally inside you.    Not a problem.    But   I just wanna keep my options open! So you can\'t breathe a word of this to Malory.  You know how she gets.  ODIN?   Well, since I\'m not appreciated here What\'s to appreciate? Exactly! That\'s indicative of your whole attitude, Mother! Sterling Malory Archer, you are of course free to pursue your options.    My Wait, hang on.  And if ODIN made you a better offer, what kind of mother would I be if I stood in the way of your happiness? Uh Wait, what just happened here? Fine! She thinks I won\'t go? Well, guess what!   I don\'t need her!   I, however, do need your keycard.  Yeah, hi, Barry Dillon please? Yes, I\'ll hold! Oh, and just wait till I get to ODIN.  I will.  Keycard?   Oh.  Here! God!   They are the stuff throwingest family.  Okay, so after I call your vase guy Freeze every one of his accounts! And then get me Woodhouse.  And we\'ll just see how tough Sterling is when he can\'t suckle at my teat!   Ugh.  Woodhouse, she froze my accounts and I need to get in my safe, so open the goddamn door already! I\'m afraid I can\'t since ISIS actually pays the rent on the Aah! Damn it! When did we get a bulletproof door? After the Popeye incident, sir.  Oh, right.  Wait, so you kick me out of my own house? Yes, sir.  Although it pains me dearly.  I\'m gonna pain you dearly, Woodhouse! When I peel all your skin off with a flensing knife, sew it into Woodhouse pajamas and then set those pajamas on fire!   Hello?   It\'s just you and me now, Reggie.  So be a lad, put on some Mingus.  Hi, Barry Dillon, please? Yes, it\'s Sterling Archer Oh.  Yes, I\'ll hold! Oh, come on! We\'ve got Ml6 in the semis on Sunday and I am slicing it like a butcher.    Just keep at it.    I think it\'s this new grip.    So listen.  Remember how you wanted me to float that job offer to Lana Kane?   Love her, yeah.  When does she start?   Right? That\'s the thing.  See, I think Sterling Archer thought I was talking to him.    Archer? You\'re kidding! I wish.  I mean, obviously the guy\'s great in the field.    Ha ha ha.  Well, you would know.    Now, see.  Why do you do that? Why do you softball them in like that?   I\'m sorry, how\'s the leg?   Hurts when it rains.  And when I think about Archer, and so I blew him off.  No, no, no, Barry, you blow him on!   "On" as in hire him? As in here?   Yes! It\'ll drive his mother crazy.  Gotta be the grip.  And you froze all of Sterling\'s accounts?   Domestic and foreign?   Even the one on the Isle of Man.  Oh, my God, is that, like, Whore Island for women?   No.    Then you just watch, in no time he\'ll be begging me to take him back.    He hasn\'t called, has he?   No.  How you holding up, Mama Bird? Well, except for your grossly over familiar tone, I couldn\'t be happier.    Even if Mr.  Archer gets a job at ODIN?   Oh, please.  ODIN won\'t hire him.  After the stunt he pulled in Berlin? Well, whose fault is that, Barry? Yours.  You bust in, shoot two good double agents And you think an appropriate response is to ruin my suit?   Oh, and my shirt.    I\'m sorry.  So will you please just help me up?   No.    For which I am pretty genuinely sorry.  Nothing two steel rods and 16 titanium screws couldn\'t fix.    Come on, don\'t be shitty.    Yeah, Barry.    It\'s water under the bridge.    Yeah, Barry.    Because he\'s part of the family now.    So go put his stuff in his office.    Yeah, Barry.  Barry, hi.  So I was wondering if your tempting offer was still open.  No, you silly man.  About the job.  No, just keeping my options open.  Definitely come in.  I mean, we did kind of fill the position but I don\'t know if it\'s gonna be a good fit.  I just don\'t see why you need this.  Because this is a huge opportunity for me and I need to feel confident.  In the interview?   Uh huh.    Oh, that looks great.  Yeah, it feels pretty good.    So come on already, take a cut.    What, like, out the window? Don\'t worry about it.  I get a deal on those, 90 cents a ball.  Um, okay.  God, you\'re a natural.    Bet it\'s all that lacrosse at boarding school.    Yeah, 13 years\' worth.  Thirteen years? What, she ship you off in kindergarten?   Ahem.  Gosh, that must\'ve been tough.    No, l I loved it.  Um Made a lot of good friends.  Family, almost, is what they were.  Speaking of, how\'s your mother taking all this? Oh, please, I bet she doesn\'t even miss me.  Because he\'ll be back, crying for his mommy.  Just like that Christmas break when I moved and forgot to give my new address to his stupid boarding school.  I mean, he rode the train into the city all by himself.  He couldn\'t pick up a phone book? Nine years old, and bawling in that police station like a little girl.    Ha! What\'s that tell you?   Kind of a lot, actually.  Oh, shut up.  I bet you\'re barren.    My God.  On Christmas?   Well, Christmas Eve, technically.  Well, the lovely Framboise from HR has some paperwork for you to sign.  So why don\'t you follow her on down to your big new corner office.    Okay.  Where the sofa is soaked in Scotchgard.    It, uh   lf you know what I mean.    Yeah, I think I do.    It\'s resistant to stains.    Right, right, I got it.    Super.  Because we\'re one big family.  Ugh.    Why do you make that sound?   Gee, let\'s see.  You\'re off to interview with ODIN home of Barry "Oh, I forgot to mention the naked laser thing" Dillon.  ODIN isn\'t some co ed freshman dorm where everyone runs around screwing.  I\'m sorry, Framboise, it\'s not you.  I mean, it\'s not me, either, obviously.  But in the office   You don\'t sex on the women at ISIS?   Constantly, but you know, it\'s not allowed.  It\'s probably illegal.    But here   Here we are one big famille.  Yeah, and the, uh, famille thing actually makes this borderline creepy.    Perhaps if you tried it from behind?   Yeah, let\'s try that.  Don\'t get any on that snappy suit.  Don\'t you have better things to do than mince around and gawk? About a million.  But Cheryl was scared to come in here so I took time out of my busy mincing schedule to tell you that you have a phone call.    Is it Sterling?   I am sure I don\'t know.    Do you know you\'re a little bitch?   Will you remember this conversation?   Probably not, no.    Well, then **** off.  Whoa, whoa with the language.  You kiss your mother with that mouth? You leave Bub out of this.  And how dare you steal my son away from me?   Steal him? You cut him loose.    You cut him loose!   What?   I want you to fire him, this instant.  No, no, I can\'t do that.  He\'s happy here, he\'s making new friends.    Goddamn it, Archer!   What, Barry? I said don\'t come in here.  Framboise, what\'d I say?   He said do not come in.    Yeah, Barry.    I don\'t care if he\'s happy.    That\'s obvious.    Meaning what, exactly?   Meaning, who leaves a 9 year old kid in a police station on Christmas?   Eve.    And he told you about that?   Oh, we\'ve had such great talks.    Fire him!   Join him.  Come work for me.    Have you lost your mind?   Every time I see you.    Fire him.    Can\'t do it.  Can\'t or won\'t?   Either?   Fine.  Then go check your Telex.    Oh, my God.  A burn notice? Look at that.  "ISIS disavows Agent Sterling Archer, a. k. a.  Duchess. "   Man, she loved that dog   "Who is to be considered an unreliable asset and security risk. " Oh, it must have killed her to do this.    Ha, ha.  And I\'m smirking.    No, you don\'t smirk at a mother\'s suffering, Barry, you asshole! Ow! It\'s just, with the shattered femur, and the gunshot wound and I don\'t know if you knew this, but Framboise and I were kind of engaged.    I did not know that.    Yeah.    And I served her up like a pudding.    Barry.    Well, engaged to be engaged.  Ow! Ass.  If you love it, put a ring on it.  Okay, so you go fix this.  You know, I\'m not even sure I want to now.    She was obviously into him.  Mother   Ass.    Not Framboise.  Archer.    The burn notice? His mother just sent that to To every agency on the planet.  Look: CIA, Ml6, Interpol.    We can\'t keep him now, Barry.    Oh.  So So you take him to the basement, you put one in his ear.    Can you do that?   Oh, my God.    That Framboise is a freak, huh?   Yeah.  Yeah, I can do that.  No, as a matter of fact I don\'t have Barry on speed dial.  Well, that\'s rather surprising.  Know what\'s surprising? Kissing you at the airport dozing off in first class, then seeing you on my flight when I get up to pee!   That, to me, is rather surprising.    And really expensive, turns out.    Just   Ha, ha.  Seriously.  I mean, I don\'t wanna sound like a jerk but that Framboise chick must have been a prostitute before she got this gig.    In, like, Bangkok.    Ahem.  I was almost embarrassed for her.    Where we going?   We are heading down to sub basement three.    Is there a shower? Because I bet I just, like, reek of her.    One second.  Dillon.    Oh, Barry, you getting that?   Really?   I\'m brushing it your way, Barry.  No, I\'m actually at the lobby right now.  Two seconds.    So wait, where are we on that shower?   Head on back up to your office.  There\'s actually a private bathroom in there.  Oh, good.  Because, like I said, I bet I just reek.  Yeah, you\'ve mentioned that.  No.  Baby, I am putting you in the corner where you will sit quietly.    Hey, you.    Hey, you.    And who are you? Cyril Figgis, ISIS comptroller and And very eager to sit here quietly in the corner because he is so tired.  Um, so I\'ll just be here, then?   Yeah?   Yeah.  No, no, no! Who put out a burn notice on Sterling?   That would be you.    What?   Ha ha ha.  Holy shit, the look on your face.    But I would never.  Not in a million Get a mirror.    Oh, dear God, did I drink absinthe?   That bottle and most of this one.    Until we wrestled it away from you.  Because you don\'t know how to share, beyotch.    Easy, tough guy.    I don\'t remember any of that.  Absinthe makes me black out.  All right, you yellow sons of bitches.  Let\'s dance.    It also makes you incredibly mean.    And ugly.    Seriously.  Danger zone.    Beyotch.    Well, don\'t just sit there.  Undo this.    Ooh.    "Ooh" what?   We can\'t, Ms.  Archer.  It\'s too late.    I\'m sorry, so, what are you saying?   I, uh   Can you not give me a minute?   No.  You fire me, I take my things.  Take all the things! Here, take this! Go staple my heart back together! How am I the bad guy in this?   So, Barry.    Huh? That was Framboise, our head of HR.    With whom I guess I won\'t be meeting?   No, she\'s gone.  And so, remember how I said we\'d just hired someone?   Yes.    And so remember Sterling Archer? Wait, wait, wait, Lana.  Barry, if you touch me, I swear to God I will put you in the ground.  That was before his mother put out a burn notice on him.  What? Malory burned Archer?   Worldwide.    Holy shit.    Yeah, so he\'s gone.    Already? Like, literally gone? Oh, my God.  I liked her better mean.  He\'s gone.  I killed my baby boy and now my baby is gone!   Oh, now, you can always   Always what? Well, I was gonna say you can have another baby but you\'re all dried up in there.  No, no, no, like, figuratively gone.  Unlike Framboise whose car should be blowing up any minute.    Oh! Ooh la la! Uh May I help you avec your box?   So Archer\'s still here?   Yeah, he\'s in that corner office.  And once Facilities cleans his brains out of it it can be your office.    Really? I don\'t think the cleaning staff does brains.  I mean, you shoot him and I get an office overlooking the Champs Elyses?   And the bank where you\'ll drive your new company car to deposit your insane paychecks and maybe, if you stand on those tiptoes, your huge apartment.    Huge as in?   As in you won\'t see your live in servants unless you really want to.  Let me go shoot this prick.    Wait.  Let me do it.    Really?   Because I would kind of love to.    Not as much as I would.    You guys kind of have a history, huh?   Yeah, you could say that.    Knock yourself out.    These servants, if I did see them would they curtsy meekly?   Heh.  Well, otherwise, what\'s the point? Archer! Come on.  Lana, why the hell are? Whoa, whoa, whoa, Lana, no! Barry, does this make up for Framboise? It does, Other Barry, it sure does.  Barry? I guess, go ahead and call Facilities or whatever.  Because there is lamp everywhere.    God, Lana! Get on with your life already!   Oh!   Telex.  You got one in here?   Why, so you can smash that too?   No.    I\'m pretty sure I\'m financially responsible for the furnishings.    So I can send a telex from ODIN to make the burn notice from your mother look like an ODIN black flag.    Mother burned me?   Apparently.  Oh, my God, that\'s classic her.  You\'re both classic her.  Shut up, get dressed and grab the keys to that car.  We\'ve got about two minutes before some ODIN dick sees this and seals the exits.  Any way we can bump that to five?   I need a shower.    Archer! Okay, God.  Climb down off that rag.  Oh, my God, looks like Jonestown in here.  Yes, Pam.  Get me some poison.  Because I am already dead inside.  Too dead inside to read good news?   Is it my obituary?   Well, it\'s not that good.  Give me that, you oaf! "All agencies disregard ISIS burn notice on Agent Archer a. k. a.  Duchess. " An ODIN black flag operation! Pam, he\'s alive.  My Sterling is alive.  Oh.  And look at happy little Mama Bird.  Well, the blowback on ODIN for this will be huge.    And I saw it coming.  I knew it.    Uh huh.  Just like I knew Sterling would come crying back to mommy wiping his snotty nose on his sleeve like a scared little boy on Christmas.    Uh huh.  Eve.  It was only Christmas Eve.    I know.  Good to have you back.  And?   And?   And do you just plan to loom over me all day, like some sort of henge?   Okay.  Well, you see? This is why.  This is why we can\'t have nice things.  Barry, you asshole!   How am I the bad guy in this?   Because I wanted this, Archer.  I\'m sick of you getting the best assignments just because your mother is the boss.  Do you know what that\'s like?   Besides awesome?   Oh!   Hang on, I think my car\'s on P 2.    Well, I have to get Cyril, who\'s on   Framboise, hello.    Hello.  Oh, man.  That\'s bad.  Yes, now.  Let\'s talk this out.  Talk what out? How you ruined my chance to work for ODIN? Or, ooh, maybe how I just caught my boyfriend balls deep in some French chick.    Ex boyfriend, I bet.    You think?   Yeah, he\'s not coming back.  That chick was like the Pele of anal.    Archer?   Sorry, I know this is tough.  I mean, Cyril, whatever, but your feelings for me are obviously conflicted You\'re right, Archer, I am conflicted.  Because if I had shot you in the face, I\'d be living here.    Getting curtsied at by servants.    Yeah, but you couldn\'t do it.  Maybe we both belong at ISIS, you know?   Maybe that\'s our real home.    That\'s what Mother said about boarding school.  And really, sorry about Cyril.    Me too.    Even if you brought it on yourself.    Excuse me?   Oh, come on, I don\'t recall ever seeing a welcome mat at your back door.    Archer.  But wait, would that cheer you up? Me and you, a little revenge anal?   Archer?   Yes?   You wearing a seatbelt?   Uh, no, why? So, uh, is that a yes, or a maybe, or? What? Oh, okay.  Then, I guess, just pout.And that\'s your message? My God.  Who? Who\'s there? What do you want? Because all you\'re gonna get is holes.  L I mean, holes in you not my Hah! Sterling?   Hello, Mother.    Where the hell have you been?   I don\'t know.    What? And why do you have a cleaver? "Interoffice fraternization of an intimate nature is prohibited to include but not limited to trysts, assignations" What\'s this even mean? It means no more banging coworkers.  Oh, so it doesn\'t affect you.  Mee hee.  Oh, wait, guess what.  Ow! Hey, this isn\'t my fault.  It\'s exactly your fault, idiot.  When Mother found out you cheated on Lana   Hey, you cheated on Lana plenty.    Yeah, but with starlets, models.  Oh, and one time, two actual princesses.    Two at the same time?   Yeah, they were sisters.    Sploosh.    Cyril, you threw Lana away on chicks like   Like Carol.    It\'s Cheryl.    Exactly, back me up here.    You slept with her too.  When I was bored.  Like, stuck at home waiting for the cable guy, or Oh, hey.  What are you doing Thursday between 9 and noon?   Ugh.    One and 4? I\'ll be doing one of your co workers.  Well, do it before quitting time Friday.    Why\'d Ms.  Archer give us until Friday?   I did that.  Somebody in this building is gonna have sex with me.  Yeah? You think between now and Friday you can score some roofies?   Heh heh heh.  Uh uh.  Pam? I will end you.  Ow! Where the hell is my staple gun? I think I saw Cyril with it.    He went through my desk?   I guess.  I mean he said he did.  I don\'t know why I\'m surprised.  I mean, can you believe him?   Cheating on Lana?   Baffling.  Said the kettle.  Which is why I started that new policy.    Yeah?   You idiots run around here like it\'s spring break on South Padre.    Just sex, sex, sex   Sexy sexy, eh? Nikolai?   Is from Frederick\'s of Latvia.    Mother? What?   Oh, hello, son.    Nikolai.    Why did he call me "son?"   What is this?   You mean besides incredibly awkward? No, I think "incredibly awkward" just about sums it up.  What? Mother! Nikolai, could I call you back? I will be here maybe in one hour then I\'ll try to hit gym, so   The gym.  That\'ll be the day.  Are you out of your mind? I must be.  Because it looks like you just destroyed my Steuben bar set.    Well, you just destroyed my innocence.    Oh, please, that Brazilian au pair did that when you were 13.    12.  And why does Nikolai Jakov the head of the KGB, have a direct line to your office? Well, you know, from time to time What? No.  Just leave that, you\'ll cut yourself.  Sterling.  And a follow up question: Why did he just call me son?   That\'s often a figure of speech.    Yeah? How often? Very often.  Just not in this case.  I know Uh What? Terrific.  Two Steuben glasses left and you break one.  I\'m sorry, Krieger, but it\'s over.  So here\'s all your Creedence Clearwater albums back.    Now a sad moon is on the rise.    I know, devastating.  But it\'s not you, it\'s your weak, womanny hands.    They\'re not   It\'s like being choked by a child.  Which I thought would be hot, but   Wait, no, I\'ll take steroids.    I can\'t wait.  I need a man now with monster hands.    Oh, like Lana ha Hey, you.  You know, the whole "monster hands" thing? Starting to border on mean.  Oh, you gonna run cry to Ms.  Archer, like when Cyril cheated on you?   Hello.    Ooh la la.  Well, at least my ex boyfriend isn\'t a noose I made out of extension cord.  Guess what.  She wasn\'t the only one Cyril cheated with.    And what is that supposed to mean?   Figure it out, Truckasaurus.  Oh, that gives me an idea.  But I already have a father.  His name was John Fitzgerald Archer.  He was a fighter ace, and he won the Navy Cross.    And his men called him   "Black Jack" Archer.  I know, dear, I know, because I made it all up.  But the military funeral.  Ready.  Aim.  Oh, my God.    Lf we miss that train I will go blind.  Fire.  But the 21 gun salute.  I donated 600 bucks to a Junior ROTC team up in Yonkers.  Which they used to go to a competition in Albany where they won third place.  So a lot of good came out of that.    So all\'s well that ends well?   What was I to do? Tell a 3 year old his father might be in the KGB? What? What do you mean might be? So there may or may not be a few other possibles in the mix.  What? Seriously? You cheated on me with Carol?   Cheryl.    Exactly.    And I can explain that.    Well if you\'d let me.  Yeah, tell me.  How my father might be Nikolai Jakov head of the KGB or Len Trexler, head of ODIN!   Well   I assume those are my only choices? Oh, my Who else?   Gene Krupa.  No, wait.    What? The drummer? Not Krupa, the other one, with the teeth.    Buddy Rich.    Oh, my   I could never say no to a drummer.    Could you say no to anybody? I said no to plenty.    No.  No.    Yes.  Have sex with me.  Please.    No.    Oh, come on.    Nobody would ever know.    Pam? Yeah.    I\'d know.  No.    Let me talk to him.    No.  No.  Nikolai, he\'s not even here.  He stormed out, thanks to you.  But I could talk sense into him.  After all, I am his father.  Oh.  So Len Trexler or Buddy Rich?   Get me that crazy German.  Now.    Ow! Ow!   Hostile work environment.    Shut up.  We are going to kidnap Agent Sterling Archer.  Oh, yeah? Then what, you hurt his feelings? Then we put new mind control microchip into his brain.  We use its remote control capability to bring him here, make the papa test.  And if I am Archer\'s father I turn him against his own mother, as Soviet agent.  Make him a, how you say, vole.    I think you mean mole.  Mole.    Huh? Vole is also rodent, but more closer related to lemming.  Come on, buddy.  Can\'t you read, ass douche? You\'re not supposed to be here without a kid.  As it happens, I am here with a child.  Mani, can we have more money for the sweets? What? That\'s not even a real baby.  And that is? I thought you were off to the fair with your prize turnip.    A tur? Listen, you kraut puke.    Hello.  Oh, yeah.  You should go.  You\'re lucky his father\'s not here.  He knows krav maga, he\'ll kick your balls through your hat you Nazi shit ass.    Mani, these people.  Well, you wanted him to grow up in the city.  Nein, major, not you.  Yeah, listening.  And after you take Archer to the KGB safehouse on Gansevoort you will implant the microchip into his brain.    Got it.  Yeah, seriously.  Okay, Uta, we have a job, so Where is the diaper bag?   I forgot where I put it.    Huge surprise.    Ow! Ow!   Idiot.  What is wrong with you? And just who the happy hell  do you think you are, hanging up on me? Oh, you gonna tell your boyfriend, Len Trexler?   Or maybe Gene Krupa?   It was the other one.  Maybe.  Or you, maybe, or Whoever it was, he wasn\'t there to raise Sterling, so I don\'t need him butting in now.    We\'ll see.  Nothing.    What? Nikolai, what are you scheming at?   Nothing.    Again he hangs up on me.  And there goes the last Steuben.    Sploosh.  That\'s what I\'m talking about.    Yup, yup, yup.  Wait, you think it\'s safe? No.  Okay, we got the French chick, and Carol and anybody else, Rambone?   No.  Hi, Cyril.    Well.  Um   Scatterbrain Jane? Really? Well, say she had just been diagnosed with breast cancer.  Oh, right.  I forgot, your dick\'s full of radiation and mastectomy coupons.  Boy, you are just so determined not to be cool about this.    Yup.  Anybody else?   Um Ms.  Archer, you\'re trying to seduce me.  Aren\'t you?   Nope, no, no one.    Okay, okay, okay.    Okay, get out.    Of my own office?   Yup.    Why? Oh, you don\'t wanna be here when I bang every last dude in the building.    What?   Here on your blotter.    No!   Yup!   You can\'t do that.    Really? Is it Opposite Day already? Uh Attention? Hi, this is Agent Kane and if you wanna have ball slappy sex with me on Cyril\'s desk please line up and take a number.  You heard the lady.  Take a number.  Eighty sixed? Uh uh.  You don\'t eighty six me.  Because my dad won the Navy Cross.    Here\'s the door.    Help.  Please help me.  My baby.  He swallowed something, he\'s choking.  Oh, who gives a shit about a baby? Who would want to raise a child here?   Well, that was a huge waste of time.    I said don\'t take your clothes off.    Well.  Well!   Begged, even.  Okay, this is good to go.    So was this.    So let\'s get number two in here.    You really think this is gonna work?   Pam, look at me.  Yeah Sploosh.  Now serving number two.  I\'m two.    That\'s me! Move, dude.    Animals.    You\'re all just animals.    Lying in wait at the watering hole taut buttocks all aquiver, just aching to pounce on the supple brown flesh of your woman.    Shut up.    They\'re gonna mess her up.    Why are you even here?   Hello.    But you\'re gay.    Girl, please.  Nobody\'s that gay.    Wait, what?   What, what? What part of you pay me 600 dollars do you not get? The part where we don\'t have sex? You get to say we did.  Which is, like, half the reason men have sex.  But that\'s a lot of money.    Not compared to rotator cuff surgery.    What? Which you\'re gonna need after the jillion high fives you give your little bros.    Okay, I\'m in.    But first guy you tell is Cyril.    And make up the sickest   Yeah, shut up, do you take plastic?   Five percent discount for cash.    I thought it was ten.  Oh, oh, oh, I can\'t wet my beak? Hey, seriously, kidnappers super not in the mood for this right now.  Or that.  What is that? Is that a drill?   Okay, so.  I don\'t want that.    I make a klein hole in his skull with this.  Just shut that off.    Then into the hole I smoosh this.  What is that? And then they can control his brain.  But is Soviet technology so it\'s a crapshoot.    This is amazing, no? What is amazing is we just ran into him on the street.    It\'s a huge city.    Hey.  Hey! Proposition.  First person to untie me, guy or gal I will let him or her give me a handy.  Ugh.    Let\'s share the milk of human kindness.    What an asshole.    Don\'t worry, your time is coming.    Wait, by time do you mean me? And by "don\'t worry", do you mean the chick\'s gonna be doing the handy? And either way, can we do it without that thing? Hey, seriously.  Give me a hanjo.  It doesn\'t work.  I drill hole in head of man who maybe is my son.  Put chip in his brain and now you tell me it doesn\'t work.  You should have asked me before, you See, in testing we have had teensy problem with signal from satellite.  When it is in small window just over the target it can signal the chip.  But when it exits this window.    Ahh.    This problem does not sound teensy! It is compared to the problem we had with interference from cell phones.  Which in lab sent test subjects into ferocious homicidal rages.  So obviously we need to tweak it.  Damn that crazy, jealous Russian.  Bet he\'s hatching some half assed, vodka soaked scheme to Hello? Ha!   Sterling? Sterling, listen very Wha? Voicemail.  You know what to do.  We\'re sorry.    Damn it.  Carol? Carol.  And just where the hell is she?   Oh, God, sorry.  Sorry.    Ahh   What are you doing?   I thought you said start slacking off.  Not slacking off.  Dude, swear to God.  She gave me a Jane Hathaway.  Right on my chest.  My man knows what I\'m talking about.  Doesn\'t anyone work around here? And Cyril I am so disgusted with you right now I just wanna vomit.  That\'s exactly what I said to Lana.  Thirty seven.  Thirty seven.  Ooh.    Uh Move.  Ugh.  Just get it done by Friday.  Oh, come on Sterling, pick up, pick Sterling? Sterling? What\'s wrong, are you in? Ha.  Alternate voicemail.    You know what to do, stupid.  We\'re sorry I\'m done.  He\'s dead to me.  Mother.  Kill Mother.  Oh, my God, I\'m exhausted.  Whereas I am merely confused.  If you told every guy the same thing then they all know that none of them had sex with you.    They\'re all gonna realize they\'re all lying.    Hey, yeah.    Wait a minute.    But remember, they\'re dudes.    What?   Um   I had sex with Lana.    Me too.    Lana Kane, you magnificent bastard.    Mwah.    I just hope Cyril don\'t, like, snap.    Cyril? Snap?   Snap.

Before I change my mind.    But you cannot say a word.    I won\'t tell anybody.  No, honey, I mean during.  Cause I\'m gonna pretend you\'re Alex Karras.  And that\'s your message? My God, who? Who\'s there? What do you want? Because all you\'re gonna get is holes.  L I mean holes in you not my Hah!   Sterling?   Hello, Mother.  Where the hell have you been?   I don\'t know.    And why do you have a cleaver?   I don\'t know.    Well, you\'re safe now.  So get out.    I\'m hungry.    So lick that coat.  You smell like a   Grilled cheese.    What?   Grill me a cheese.    I\'m not grilling you a cheese.  Oh, for God\'s sake.  Waltz in here, dressed like some sort of cattle rapist.  Waving a cleaver and reeking of what I hope to God is meat.  And that\'s all you have to say?   I don\'t know.    I was worried sick.  Called you twice came this close to leaving And why doesn\'t your voicemail just say, "Leave a message, I\'m a jackass"?   I don\'t know.    I don\'t know.  I don\'t know.  What is wrong with you? My head hurts.  And I have no father.  Sterling, of course you have a father.    Just maybe not the one you wanted.    And you And me neither.  Because even though that whole weekend is just a big jazzy blur, I\'m pretty sure it wasn\'t Buddy.    And all these years, you lied to me.    Sterling, I was protecting you.  From what, this sandwich?   This is Swiss, Mother!   Because that\'s all I had.  You ass.    Just like I\'m all that you have.    Well, I hate it.  And I hate you.  Sterling Malory Archer, you will eat every last crumb of that sandwich.    No.    Then get out.  I\'ll call you a cab.  Sterling, stop that this instant.    Kill Mother.    Waah! Ah.  Kill Mother.  Police, police, have to call the Waah! Dja vu, huh? I\'m having a nightmare and you lock me out of your bedroom?   Sterling, no, stay back.    Only this time, you\'ll be crying for help.    Sterling!   And I\'ll be the one drinking and laughing in there with Uncle Buddy!   Sterling, I\'m warning you.  Sterling! Sterling? Sterling.  Sterling! What? God.  Well, whose fault is that? Waving a cleaver, screaming in Russian?   I\'m sorry.    Ass.  Seriously, I don\'t know what\'s going on with my head.  Filthy coat, can\'t tell what\'s cow\'s blood and what\'s yours.  The wet blood, Mother, is mine.    And it\'s ruining my brand new linens.    Sorry.    This is why I can\'t have nice things.    Why, because you shoot them? Serves you right.  You nearly scared me to death.  Well, you obviously weren\'t that scared, judging by your grouping.    Uhn.    Hah.  Guess the old gal\'s still got it.    All six, right in the ten ring.    Hooray.  Just like I taught you.  Without any help from whoever your father is.    Yeah, you were always there for me.    Which I never really thank you for.    Sterling, I don\'t need thanks.  That\'s what makes me such a wonderful mother.    Ha ha.  Are you kidding?   Don\'t be shitty.    Can\'t we just enjoy the moment?   Yeah, how could we not? Ass.So if you want paper towels in there, you\'ll just have to supply your own.  Where do you get paper towels? And, last item, on a related note, I have no choice but to cut salaries.  Eight percent, across the board! And let\'s just put a lid on it! Do we have to supply our own lids? Look, I didn\'t invent the economy! And until Isis gets in the black, we all have to make some sacrifices, so Line one for you.  It\'s your furrier.  Unbelievable! We have to cut back but you\'re buying new horseshoes? Tell him to send over the gray fox.  See? Sacrifice.  At this rate I\'ll be reduced to wearing nutria.  On your horse with his fancy new shoes.  Oh for the That\'s a farrier! I know.  And this Is Konrad Schlotz.  Herr Schlotz controls all of Europe\'s Videotex services.  Videotex? Wow, growth industry So he\'s worth billions.  And I want to convince him to invest in Isis.  Well that\'s gonna be a tough sell We\'ve posted losses for fifteen straight quarters, so So that\'s why you\'re going to cook up a different set of books, Cyril.  Ooh no, I\'m not comfortable with that.  Think you\'d be more comfortable on another little vacation? Upstairs? No, I was dating Lana but since I suffer from sexual addiction, which these quacks deny is even real, now they\'re treating me for Can somebody! Please! Shut up that damn coyote? Clormatrazapam? No.  No I would not.  So unless you want me send you back I will start cooking the books.  Good thing you know how to cheat.  Hey, ya know what? Enough! Now then, this is a two prong operation.  The books are prong one, while prong two is El Frente Rojo.  Derby day, wore that exact same hat.  Shock! Herr Schlotz fears they may attempt a kidnapping during a birthday party he\'s throwing this weekend in Gstaad Ach, Gstaad!   Oh yeah, count me in!   And me out.  I\'m not getting frostbite protecting some old German guy.  Herr Schlotz isn\'t the intended victim.  It\'s his daughter, Anka Who obviously needs someone on her constantly, and so I will be that someone, who is constantly on her! For God\'s sake, Sterling, she\'s turning seventeen! Oh, eww! Sorry, even for you Archer C\'mon, she doesn\'t look like she\'s just turning seventeen! No, she looks like she\'s just turning eighteen.  Exactly.  Plus Europeans use the metric system, which Sterling Malory Archer, you will not touch a single hair on that girl.  I See? How I just let that go by? Look at me.  I\'m the perfect gentleman.  No.  This is completely unacceptable.  Cutbacks, I get it, but you cannot expect me to share a room with Ray.  Aw, I\'ll be gentle Mother! You know what he\'s implying, right? Stop whining, we\'re all making do.  Why, I\'m sharing a room with Lana Hooray And Pam\'s sleeping in the cellar.  Yeah, and if money\'s so damn tight, why is she even here? Eh, she\'s making me mule back a buncha this crap That "crap" is three hundred dollars a bottle, and you can\'t get it in America, so not another sip! And the rest of you, make room in your luggage for ten liters apiece.  Unbelievable I know, what kind of limit is that? Ah gut, you are here, Frau Archer! Ah ah ah! It\'s Fraulein Archer! She added, desperately And these are my top agents, who are ready to lay down their lives to protect your, um Lovely daughter.  Let\'s hope it doesn\'t come to that Ja, but if it does Let\'s hope not.  You must protect my princess.  Anka is all I have in the world since her mother passed away.  Oh, you poor thing.    You\'re a widower?   Oh, like you didn\'t KNOW! No! No!   What is wrong with you?   Did no one just see that? Jumpy, eh? Truly, *** has not frightened the famous Sterling Archer.  No, she does!   My Anka? What do you mean?   Oh, right! Yeah, Archer, Anka is dirty sexy.    What?   Sterling! She is only 16!   I   Oh, schwein! No, I know! I\'m not.    Don\'t come near her again.    Come on!

He started it.  Can\'t I leave you two alone for even one hour without you going at it? I should have asked myself the same thing about you two Meaning what? Meaning you left me for my brother! Your twin brother.  So obviously I still find you very attractive.  And I have good news! Even though Sterling Archer is here in Gstaad Archer?! Ay, dios mio! It won\'t be a problem to kidnap that bourgeois perrita.  Her father has forbidden Archer to go near her! So then we go with my plan.  Your plan stinks more than that cheese.  I think that smell is them.  But even they smell better than your stupid plan.  We go with my plan.  Fine.  You don\'t want the world\'s greatest secret agent on the case? Fine! You want little countess Von Fingerbang to get kidnapped? Fine! Oh oh oh, and as for you, Ray! Sterling Archer may be many things, but he\'s not Fine? Oh, I think he is very fine Hey no no, Anka, you can\'t be in here! Anka? Mr.  Archer, how familiar you are.  You must address me by title Countess Von Fingerbang.  Noooope! C\'mon Anka, seriously, you seriously gotta get outta here before Shit! Before the cops show up, or Wait, what do you have in Switzerland, some kinda pikemen? I don\'t know I am from Germany.

Well, spoiler alert: One of them doesn\'t have any skin on his face.  Meaning what? Meaning I set one of them on fire? Was that before or after you got caught fondling a teenager? Well, obviously before! After was all Gendarmes and dick stitches! Ugh And I didn\'t touch her, Lana, so there\'s no reason to be jealous! Whatever! How\'s your Wilhelm? Aagh! Should I kiss it and make it better? No, you should get away from me! Look, I\'m serious, you need help! You need help, Archer! She came up to me! Ray, what is a What did you call it? "Blow job?"

Yeah, which is last.  Which is third.  In the world.  You lost, Ray.  Jesus, get over it.  It actually was a huge disappointment.  *** Months of preparation ruined! How could you be so stupid? Carlito, he obviously did not mean to get set on fire.  We should have gone with my plan.  Which was superior in every way! So then now we do your plan.  My plan requires three people.  Three people who have faces! Putamadre! Now I must call headquarters for reinforcements.  Good idea, mi amor.  You are so clever.  And sexy.  That sounds like Schlotz, but Oh my God, Pam must be getting naked! All these idiots think about sex.  It\'s called nymphomania.  Maybe mixed with borderline personality disorder, I mean I dunno, Lana, I\'m not a developmental psychologist, but Archer, I\'m serious I\'m serious.  That girl\'s a nightmare.  No, a nightmare is sharing a room with your mother, who expects me to Loofah, I know Protect! Some eurotrash brat! Who\'s got about a jillion guests coming to her stupid birthday party tomorrow! Yeah Think they\'re gonna have a band? Or just a DJ? I don\'t Why don\'t you go find out? No, I can\'t be alone.  That\'s when she strikes, like a slutty little ninja.  Eww, is that Schlotz and Pam?

Got any ideas? Because I\'m all ears! Why don\'t we take that? Well obviously we\'re gonna take that.  C\'mon! Oh, Archer! We are safe now, ja? Well, it\'s a little early to say But I really kinda doubt it.  I mean, I\'m sure I\'ve been in worse situations But right now I\'m kinda drawing a blank.  What the hell\'s all that, ya reckon? Immigrants.  Cramming their lowriders full of free health care and Snow.  We should go to the gendarmerie! Yeah, if you weren\'t topless! Oh, and hadn\'t accused me of molesting you!

Faster? I\'m freezing to death already! You shoulda thought of that before you took your stupid clothes off! Seriously, would you go? I\'m doing it like you said.  Grip it as hard as you can, and twist the absolute shit out of it! Oh, I get it! Just like men love it on their Wilhelm! No we don\'t Oh, my God! You\'ve never even seen a Wilhelm! Wh ? I have seen dozens! Scores even! You are such a liar! I bet you\'ve never even gotten to second base! I Well, so maybe not! So what? What do you mean so what? Why do you behave like No one cares how I behave! Mama is gone, papa is always at work, so I just rot away at that boarding school! Yeah, and then I bet you get Sent off to camp all summer! Riding camp, skiing camp! Lacrosse camp! It\'s like he doesn\'t want me around! Yeah, so you misbehave because You just want a little attention! And it\'s so hard to make friends! Because you\'re insecure, so you overcompensate, and come across as A snob, or arrogant, yeah, no I get it! You know Archer, I think you and I are a lot alike I don\'t do that! Okay, I think that\'s all of em! Which is good, because I\'m out of ammo And we\'re out of gas.  Fantastic.  Guess we\'ll have to hike back.  Oh my God! You must be freezing.  Hey relax, you\'re gonna be okay.  We\'ll get you back to the hotel and All the wind from the driving, Archer, my hands are really burning! Ooh, that\'s first degree frostbite.  Too bad you don\'t have big, mitteny gloves, like me.  I can\'t feel a thing in these.  And it\'s like my breasts are on fire! I, um, just maybe put your hands on them.  My hands are like ice! But yours are No!   Please   No, we can make it back in like   half hour tops.    I can\'t wait that long.  Please, with such big, mitteny gloves, it won\'t even count! Nooope! But I could get nerve damage! That\'s actually a possibility.  Please, Archer! Just for one minute! Um Literally one minute, and only because this is a medical emergency.  Ahh that feels nice.  No it doesn\'t, don\'t enjoy this, this is a medical proced Oww! What\'s wrong? Nothing, just um My stitches.  Oh yeah? Gettin\' a little "local swelling?" Right.  I can\'t believe I let this happen It was those damn green Russians.  Yeah, they pack a wallop And if you ever breathe a word of this, I will gut you like a carp.  Hey, what happens in Gstaad Stays in Gstaad.  Now who\'s ready for a shower? This gal!Splendid.  Yes.  And we\'ll work out all the details when hm? Yes, it sounds amazing, it really does, but We\'ll talk about it when you get here.  Hm? Mm.  Something on your mind, dear? Not anymore.  What in the a microchip? Russian markings? What on earth is this? Krieger thinks it\'s some kind of satellite linked mind control device.  Mind control? Why does he think that?   Because he removed it from my brain?   What?! I told Krieger about my headaches, he gives me a cat scan, then boom.  Next thing I know he shoots me full of some kinda, I dunno, fish paralyzer   That crazy   And then it was drill, baby, drill.  Oh my God, how do you feel? Little pissed off, actually.    Well that\'s understan   Because it was obviously put in my brain in the first place by your boyfriend, Nikolai Jakov of the KGB! Sterling, first of all we\'re not even together anymore   I bet.    And second of all! Why would he put a mind control chip into your brain? I assume because he thinks he\'s my father! And what, you think he wanted to mind control you into loving him? You tell me! That\'s your specialty!   Get out.    No.  Yes! Mother, you\'ve been lying to me my entire life! Just for once, I want you to tell me the truth! Well, people in hell want ice water.  Now if you\'ll excuse me, I\'m right in the middle of a fairly huge deal.  Buying a lock factory? For your information, I\'m no, never mind, you\'ll find out soon enough as it is.  Oh, that\'s classic you! Avoid the truth, bury the secrets, hide the   Oh for theI\'m selling ISIS!   You what?! There! Happy? No.  Mother, tell me this is a joke! The only joke is my bank statement.  What? Everything I had was in a hedge fund, but it turns out the whole thing was nothing but a damn Ponzi scheme I lost all my money.  I\'m ruined.  so you\'re selling ISIS? She what?! Aww, maaan That\'s totally not iree.  Then why don\'t you go back to Jamaica? A, because I got deported, and B So can she actually sell ISIS? Like, doesn\'t the government own it? Yeah, I\'ve never been clear on that.  It\'s way too complicated to explain, especially to you two, but short answer yes, she can sell ISIS.  The question is, who would buy it? ODIN?! CHERYL/CAROL Or whom Yes, ODIN.  Why would ODIN want to buy Oh my God, is Len Trexler behind this?! He made me a very attractive offer.  I bet! That\'s because he wants to you know, that! With you!   But wait a minute, does he know you\'re   Gorgeous! Hello, Leonard! Hello, beautiful! Hey, kiddo.  Hey back and if you don\'t mind, we\'re kind of in the middle of something?! Actually Sterling, if you don\'t mind? Len and I have a lot to talk about.  Like selling ISIS out from under us?! That, and the round the world luxury cruise I\'m taking with your mom.    The what?   Hopefully in the honeymoon suite! The what?! And then the unemployment office, after ODIN lays us all off.  Ugh! That totally stinks! Eh, you were on borrowed time anyway.  No, that! What are you eating?! Ackee and saltfish.  Yeah thanks, this is only mohair! So, you really think ODIN\'s gonna get rid of everybody? No.  Not everybody In fact, ODIN plans to promote a very select few ISIS personnel to fill some of the impending vacancies.  Vacancies like? Malory Archer\'s chair.  Wh ? Really?! Well figuratively, I mean I don\'t know about the actual chair, but   So I\'d be like, like the   Regional director for the Americas.  Barry, that\'s my dream job! Yours for the taking.  If you are similarly mine.  For the taking.  Taking as in to get this job I\'d have to have sex with you? Your words.  And also mine.  Yes.  Hey! hey! Do you idiots wanna hear my plan or not?! Okay, so suggestions.  About what? What\'re we talking about?! Stopping my mother from selling ISIS to ODIN! You said you had a plan! My plan, is to crowdsource a plan! My ear bells! Don\'t you people have work to do?! Not for long, huh? Uh, can\'t wait to welcome each and every one of you into the ODIN family! And speaking of, kiddo, hope you\'re gonna welcome me into your family.  My fam, uh, uh, uhrrowrrmf! Ugh! You people better not track that onto the carpet! It\'s filthy enough as it is.  C\'mon, Len.  I\'ll follow you anywhere, my sweet!   Holy shitsnacks   Is Trexler buying ISIS just to get your mother to marry him?!   No! Yes! Look, shut up.    That is some high priced MILF.  Hey! Shut up! And think of a way to make Trexler not want my mother! We could give her a MILFectomy.  If you say milf one more time, I will shoot you in your eyeballs.  She does have a point, though Not the m i l f part!   But if we could make Trexler fall out of love   How? Trust me, you can\'t control a person\'s heart.  You can with a little thing I like to call a deep cycle marine battery.  Or LSD.  Is that what you\'ve been giving me?! Yes?   Well that explains a lot   I thought those were breath strips! But anyway, whatever, emotions like "love" don\'t actually come from the heart, they The brain! Yeah.  Or LSD.  Oh, come on Where is the trust? What could be so secret she wired it up with twelve pounds of C 4? Ugh, I don\'t think I even wanna know What.  Nice.  Here, take a look at this.  Okay, which one of these wires Blue and yellow.  Ya wanna look at it for more than half a second? I wired the damn thing! Ass! Well I didn\'t know that! Ass!   Okay   I lied, I didn\'t wire it.  ARCHER What?! Badumpbump.  You think that\'s funny? Not compared to that.  What is that? Oh yeah.  No no no no no, Ray what do I do?!   Well if you don\'t shut if off   She\'ll know somebody was in here! So you could wait for the batteries to die   Okay, yeah that\'s   But sounds like there\'s about four big ol\' D cells in it.    ARCHER Aww, maaan   Yeah, it\'s it\'s pretty big.  Is it black?   ARCHER Wh ? No, it\'s   Slightly darker black? ARCHER No! It\'s not any kind of black!   Racist.    Shut up! It\'s more of a Aubergine? I guess you\'d call that? Oh.  Still pretty hot.  Will you shut up?   Take a picture.    Shut up! Okay, I\'m going in.  Aww man, can\'t believe I\'m doing this Try to think about something else.  Like how there\'s no sink in there.  So what if there\'s no Oh my God! Yeah.  There\'s no sink! Ugh there\'s not enough liquor and therapy in the world to undo that.  I touched my mother\'s dildo.  You shoulda borrowed these.  They\'re like super heavy du aagh! Hey! What the hell\'re you doing? What\'re you doing?! Making robot birds? Lana we\'re in crisis mode, Mother\'s trying to sell us to ODIN! I know.  So how about don\'t break any more stuff in my new office? Your new oh my God, ODIN\'s making you the new boss? Yup.  I mean, I kinda maybe have to sleep with Barry, but ARCHER Wh ?! Lana, how can you do that?! By getting drunk and knowing it\'s the same thing your mother\'s doing? And I know that it\'s killing you that she\'s leaving you for another man, and you better not mess it up for me.  Speaking of mess, you traitor, your stupid birdbot is leaking.  My what? Aw, shit! Probably hydraulic fluid.  It\'s sweet and sour, dumbass! Yeah who\'s the dumbass now, Lana?   Or whom   Barry.  How\'s your shattered femur? How\'s your creepily childlike feeling of maternal abandonment? The sale isn\'t final yet, Barry.  No, but it will be.  And we\'re here to make sure of it.  So don\'t try to do anything stupid.  I don\'t have to try.  Shit, whatever, move.  Barry, is that how you get ants? Yes it is, Other Barry, yes it is.  Okay, the satellite link is online So let\'s play God.  Freaky I\'ll tell what\'s freaky, is guess what I had already named this bunny.  Rabbert Klein.  Wow, that\'s actually better.  All yours.  So can you put it in a person\'s brain? He\'d suffocate.  Not the rabbit, idiot! The chip! Oh! Yes, absolutely! Without killing the person? Oh.  Yeah, maybe.  Ahhhh doesn\'t that feel good? Feels better than this offer.  Len, I need at least twenty percent down.  Aww c\'mon, it\'s not like you need the money.  You\'re already loaded.  What if I weren\'t? Then you\'d know I loved you for you.  You really do, don\'t you? And always have.  What about all those years you spent shacked up with what\'s her face, the crazy one?   Anastasia   No, the tall brunette.  Crazy crazy.  Yeah, Anastasia.  She killed herself.  Oh.  Right, sorry.  Yeah, that\'s how you like it, huh?   All down in your nooks and crannies   So hey, hate to interrupt   your conversation   It wasn\'t a conversation Lana, I was just talking to my gun, not with it.  Pretty big difference.  Huge, yeah, so, are they in there signing the sale contract, or?   As we speak.    Yessss! Cause I\'ve got tons of ideas to run this place more efficiently once I\'m ODIN\'s regional director.  Already jotted a bunch down.  Hey, that\'s great.  Hope you bring that same kind of enthusiasm and self starterishness to having sex with me.  Oh.    So us hooking up is still, um   A perquisite for the job, yeah.  Or is do I mean prerequisite? Either way, Barry\'s pretty stoked.  Okay, so that\'s Barry and Lana Pam, you\'re the amorphous   rasta blob   Big ups.  Those are the ODIN guys, Ray you\'re the little pink sailor, and Why do you have so many damn dolls in here? For sexual harrassment complaints.  So people can non verbally indicate where stuff happened on their body.  Yeah that takes like, one doll.  Not if there\'s ever a gang rape.  Cyril, better pill up.  You\'re assisting Krieger with the surgery.    Wh ? ! Why me?!   You\'re good at math.  How is that supposed to help?! Can\'t hurt.  Ray you lure Lana into the mainframe, Carol you lure Barry I wanna lure Barry! Wrong bait Ray, he\'s straight.  How do you know? How do I he was engaged! I was married! For two years.  I mean, she was a lesbian, but still we met in a "Pray Away the Gay" bible group.  That was a pretty weird time for me.  Just get Lana in the mainframe! I\'ll take care of Trexler, and Pam? You\'re job is to neutralize the ODIN agents.  How the shit am I s\'posed to do that?! With Krieger\'s magic breath strips.  But do not touch them.  Lysergic acid is absorbed right through the skin.  Even the tip of your fing uh oh.  Oh for [BEEP]\'s sake, Krieger! You\'re about to do brain surgery! Yeah, so sooner\'s gonna be better than later.  Dammit, how much time do we have?! For me, usually about twenty minutes.    Usually?!   Less if I take two.  Man, you have got a problem.  Oh right, like you\'re one to talk.  Yeah, Pillbo Baggins.    CYRIL These are from a doctor!   So?! Krieger\'s a doctor! Not a medical doctor! Not even the other kind.  Technically.  I gotta tell ya guys Um, not feeling super confident bout this plan.  Racist.  I guess you must be the infamous "Barry" everyone\'s talking about.  Yeah, go away?   Infamously few of words I guess!   Go away.  Um, so Lana said to give you this? Pretty succinct.  Guess you guys have lots in common! Like, I bet your genitals are the same distance from the ground.  Look alive, gang.  I think Archer\'s gonna try to torpedo this deal, so until the contract is signed, don\'t let Archer anywhere near that office.  What\'re you don\'t do that, You asshole.  We\'re buying this place.    Carpet\'s shitty enough as it is   I\'ll tell ya what\'s shitty, is somebody\'s breath around here.  Whoa! Here, take three or four of \'em.  Probably won\'t kill you guys, either.  Cause somebody smells like they ate the ass end out of a northbound cow.  Well? What do you think? I think I\'m gonna miss you so much! Aww honey, you\'re not going anywhere.  Not when I\'m the regional director.  But are you sure you\'ll get the job? Totally, yes! I mean, I do kinda have to sleep with Barry, Oh right, he said tell you he\'s in the mainframe and it\'s now or never.    Really?   Used those exact words.  Uck.  It all feels so dirty.  Yeah, the carpet in there\'s gross.  No, trading sex for this job.    I mean it\'s the chance of a lifetime, but   Honey, look at me.  We all gotta do what we all gotta do.  You wouldn\'t hate me for it? Oh, God no.  But just do reverse cowgirl, because that carpet\'s seriously heinous.  Wow! So guess that worked, huh? Pamela cool runnins, mon.  ARCHER God, would you give it a rest, um uh Damn, I had something for this.  Blob Marley.  Alright, there\'s my signature.    And once you countersign   We can set sail for romance! Mazatlan, Maui, maybe even a small wedding on the beach in Tahiti? Yeah, about that Can I borrow Len for a second? Why? To give him my blessing in asking for your hand in marriage? Well that\'s just weird.  No, it\'s beautiful! Well maybe not traditional, but it\'s a damn classy move! After you, kiddo!   Barry?   In here! Just doing some deep knee bends.  Nude.  Wanted to stay loose.  Yeah, so listen, about the job, and this I don\'t think I can do it.  Then why\'d you send me that note? What note? What the ?! Hey! Hey! Open this damn door! Sorry, honey! Please don\'t hate me! Just doing what I gotta do I sorta pictured more of a lounge, Morris chairs, that kinda stuff   ARCHER Yeah.  So listen, about you and Mother   We\'re in love, kiddo.  Well, maybe you\'re in love.  She\'s just in need.    Of what?   Of money! She\'s broke, Trexler, she lost everything in a Ponzi scheme.    So what\'re you saying, she\'s   Using you! You dumb idiot! Doesn\'t matter.  I\'m crazy about her! And if I can be there for her when she really needs me, then all the better! I was afraid you\'d say that.  Why? Ow! Why are you doing that?!   Hello   What is that?! Fish paralyzer? Okay.  Okay, he\'s out.  How\'s Krieger doing? Not, um, great.  Yes he is, let\'s do this!   So, are we gonna do this or?   No, we\'re not.  For a big list of reasons, at the top of which is Archer.  You\'re not still into that guy? No! But he\'s out there, somewhere and somehow, dashing all my hopes.  Look this sale is gonna happen.  So what we should do is spread our clothes around, so our naked bodies don\'t touch this carpet.  Oh, for the sweet and sour? Might as well start an ant farm.  And what\'s taking those two so long? Wow.  So that didn\'t take long, huh?   I dunno   That was rhetorical.  Okay, Krieger!   Yes!   What are you doing?   What\'s next?!   Uh uh uhOkay, cue visual! Roger! Cueing visual! Awww! There\'s my lovely lady love!   Okay now, uh wow, that feels good   Krieger! Oh! Commence the Modified Ludovico! Commencing the Modified Ludovico! Aaghh! No no no, I don\'t like this! Who is that horrible woman?! That\'s Malory Archer.  You love her.  Oh no.  Oh no no no no.  Ick!   Krieger?!   Uh, uhcommence satellite link! Commencing satellite link! So, you wouldn\'t want to marry her? No, eww! No, please! Make it stop!   Uh, uh, what do I do, what do I   Just hit tab! Oh.    Idiot.    Okay, it\'s over.  And you\'re sure you don\'t want to marry that woman.  Oh God, no! No, ya know what I want?   Tell me.    Some of that lettuce.    Um okay.    Or actually all of it? And the bunny attached to it, he\'s attached right, can I have the bunny and the lettuce? Uh, can we give Lenny the rabbit? And the lettuce! Sure thing.  Go to town.  Yeah cause they\'re brothers.  Is he always going to be like this, cause now I feel bad.  Sterling? Len? Either and or both? Where the hell are you? ! Len!! Yeah, do you know where he is? Yes, I\'m just screaming his name down the hall to celebrate that fact.    That some kinda joke?   Is that? It\'s cold in here.  Because she\'s here! The big bad lady is here and she is cooold! Len, what\'s going on?! You\'re mean and I don\'t like you and I don\'t want ISIS or you and all I want is this lettuce and his brother   Rabbert Klein   Rabbert Klein, so Barry, you ass, for the love of all that\'s green take me and Rabbert to the lettuce store!   Sterling Malory Archer   Yes, Mother I\'m here for you.  You did the right thing, honey.  LANA And all it cost me was my dream job.  And a broken hand.    Which kills   Here.    I\'m good.    Racist.  Buy you a cup of coffee? Ya know, since you\'re broke? You meddling ass.    Sterling, I know what you did to Trexler.    I didn\'t do anyth Yes you did! Because certain "items" in my desk Bop bop bop bop bop! I can\'t hear you.    were not where I put them!   Bop bop bop bop bop! And we never need to speak of that sickening invasion of privacy again.  Yeah, and the neverer the better.  But since I can only assume that Russian mind control chip is rattling   around in Len Trexler\'s bald head   Not rattling,   Krieger stapled it   I had to go Plan B, and lease out three floors in the building And also sell the cleaners.  You sold the cleaners? To who?   Or whom   Wh ? ! Popeye?! Mmm hm.  And he paid upfront, in cash! Yeah not surprising, considering the fact he\'s a loan sharking pimp! Former loan sharking pimp.  I\'m going legitimate.  What do you know about dry cleaning?! I know you still owe me three grand.    Yeah and I told you   And I also know I got five of your hand tailored suits in the back.  Wh ? You\'re holding my suits hostage?! Collateral.  Now get the outta my cleaners.  I think it\'s a good fit.  See you tomorrow Popeye! Mm hm.  What do I know about dry cleaning I know I\'m switching from perc to D5.  Goin green up in here.What do you even do here? Sit on your ass and analyze data? I\'m a field agent, Isaac Newton, I risk my life, so yeah I do deserve the best space in the parking garage.  Like it would kill you to roll 50 feet.  Stupid thing\'s electric.  Archer, I still haven\'t got those TNE reports you promised.  Are you sure? You didn\'t eat them? Yeah, well, since Lana broke up with me I\'ve been finding solace in food.  Well, keep your chins up Cyril.  All eleven of them.  Cyril\'s about half a rack, huh? Yeah, so why do you pick on him? I, oh, was that a rhetorical? And why are you bleaching everything? Ugh because it sneezed out here! Okay.  And is mother in?   Oh, she\'s in there, all right,   And they\'re expecting you.  Thanks, crazy.  Who\'s they? Hello, Archer.  Trinette?! Why are you here? You don\'t call me for a year, and that\'s how you talk to me?! Yes, dear.  Where are your manners? Oh, I\'m sorry.  I guess I skipped the Emily post chapter about how to introduce your mother to a hooker! Escort! Ya puke.  And I\'m retired.  Yeah? Your 401k doing that well? I have a sep, smartass! Oh, and this.  So I ain\'t worried about gettin\' by.  What is Why, is this a subpoena? It\'s for the paternity test.  The what?! Yes, "the what," dear And "the who. " What who?! Who is that?! Why, this is Seamus McGoon Sterling.  No, Seamus Sterling McGoon Archer.  And why is that "who" named like me?! Why do ya think? I\'m asking you why! Because he\'s your son.  You colossal idiot.  Why? Why didn\'t you just get the vasectomy like I ask you to?   Honestly, I thought it would hurt.    And this doesn\'t?   It it\'s apples and oranges.    I\'m not ready to be a grandmother.    Really? But you\'re so Grandmother ly? No Old.  If and when I am ready for a grandchild it won\'t be the potato face spawn   of some Irish whore!   Exactly.  It\'s probably not! I mean, seriously, what\'re the odds on that?   So she had a lot of Ugh   You kidding? I used to have to book her weeks in advance.    Although   Although what? Um whew! Wow, Trinette, that was amazing.  Yeah, that Wh ?! Wait a minute! You liar! This ain\'t a condom wrapper, it\'s from a frickin\' candy bar! So? Sometimes I like to treat myself.  Well, sometimes I like to ovulate! Well, I gotta sleep, so do it somewhere else.  Money\'s on the dresser.  Nothing.  Hundred to one, he\'s mine.  Well, he better not be! My God, I couldn\'t bear the shame it would bring on this   family to have um   No.  Please, mother, finish that thought! Oh my God, you\'re such a hypocrite! You were gonna say "illegitimate child"! No, I was going to say "bastard. " Ouch.  I mean, that\'s gotta hurt, huh? Why should I care if Archer knocked up some dumb hooker? Because babies are soft skulled, fat little germsacks, and now we\'ve all been exposed to that one\'s bacteria! What? Don\'t engage her.  But c\'mon, Lana, you dated Mr.  Archer forever and And you have nothing to show for it.  Paging doctor Loggins.  Couple things One, I don\'t need a baby to validate my existence.  Two, the absolute last person on earth I\'d have a baby with is Archer, because he is not sold separately.  Did you try Yeah, I\'ll come over, mother.  Just gimme 20 minutes.  Well, I\'m sorry, Lana! But I didn\'t invent the childproof pill bottle! So as far as Archer\'s concerned, I actually feel like I dodged the world\'s most dysfunctional bullet.  Yeah, but Cyril was Oh, wait! Did he have some sort of character flaw? Hello, hello, hello! Couple things   Yeah, we are code blue here   Hey, yeah, blue! Like for baby boys!   No, I meant like for her face, but   No, like for let\'s have a baby shower for Trinette and the wee baby Seamus! Oh, my God, yes.  But you\'re place is disgusting, so where can we have it? Well, Archer\'s got that bangin\' pad.  Ooh, he\'ll hate that! I wanna come! Ooh, I think I just did And, so, thank you both for coming.  Even though, Mr.  Archer is the only party named in the subpoena.  Well, we both have invested interest in the outcome of this silly test.  And said test will, obviously, be administered by a third party, so A third party?! But we have a state of the art laboratory at ISIS! Normally, I wouldn\'t let an intern do this on his first day but Chet? How\'s it hanging, buddy? I\'m sure you do.  But our client has concerns about the integrity of the test results, given your agency\'s clandestine nature.  Oh, and by the way, super crazy about that elevator pretending it\'s a dryer.  Barry? But all kidding aside, ODIN will be providing security for the paternity test.    Odin?!   Oh, yeah.  Hello, Archer.  Barry.    How\'s it hanging, buddy?   Hanging great, Barry.  How\'s the leg? Barry, does it hurt? Cause it looks like it kinda hurts.  It did hurt, and it still does, so So how can Trinette afford ODIN?! This is pro Bono.  Consider it payback for my shattered femur.  And that reminds me doctor Ben? Wh ?! And what the hell is this?! We take a blood sample from Archer My God? What year is this?! I know, right?! Why can\'t you just take a DNA swab?! A blood sample is enough to determine paternity.  And after we take a liter A liter?! How much is a Owww! Archer will be left in a weakened state, which should prevent his attempting to compromise the test.  Turtlenecks, I invented those.  You\'re bleeding him dry! Ser\'sly, Barry, how much is a liter? About 8 gills.  What\'s a gill? You\'re just talkin\' in circles.  Thanks doctor Ben.  Next! Under ODIN guard, the sample is taken to the vault of First Savings Bank.  I don\'t know why I told you where, but it doesn\'t matter, as the bank and vault will be surrounded by ODIN agents.  Merely an added precaution, as the vault is basically one big shitstorm of anti intrusion devices.  Tomorrow, in full view of both parties, we will test the sample here, along with a blood sample from wee baby Seamus, thus ensuring complete accuracy of the paternity test.  Any questions? Yeah, Barry I\'m still unclear on the liter thing? Vis a vis, uh, unit of volume I seriously don\'t feel good at all.  That\'s because those ODIN ghouls drained a fifth of your blood.  Oh hey, speaking of fifth A drink\'s the last thing you need! Well, you might want one too, cause Pretty decent chance the baby\'s mine.  What?! What happened to a hundred to one?! I may have uh, massaged that number.  How can I show my face around town if Trudy Beekman will eat me alive for this! Decent chance.  Oh, oh, oh, and I can just forget all about getting on the board at the met! The museum or the opera? Either! Sterling Malory Archer, you are going to break in that vault and replace your blood with someone else\'s! Someone else\'s blood.  Yeah, great, I\'ll just have Igor bring a villager up to my castle.  Oh, Igor! Yeesss? Oh, evening sir.  Hello, mum! Woodhouse, what the hell is this?! It\'s a baby shower! What\'s it look like, ya puke? Ugh.  I think I could use a drink.  Sterling? Pick a villager.  Why did you let them in my house?! Because I told you to buy lemon curd, Woodhouse! Now what am I gonna spread on my toast? Your tears?! They just sort of barged in, sir Uh huh.  And why are you barefoot?! Oh, you guys, it\'s so sweet.  I made that! It was gonna be a ham cozy, but then I was like "eh. " So.  Well, he can use it as a blankie.  And eww.  What is this, homemade salad dressing? Breast milk.  I have my own.  So you won\'t need this.  It\'s some plastic dry cleaner bags.  Oh, and a book about SIDS.  Wh ?! What kinda shit gift is that?! Yeah, right? I made mine.  Me too! That\'s disgusting.  If I wanted to look at your bare feet, I\'d sneak in and do it while you were asleep! Well? Have you picked out a donor? Yeah.  I dunno if it\'s the blood loss or what, but this whole thing feels Pretty stupid, Archer.  Getting a hooker pregnant? Yikes.  Cyril Oh, sorry, Ms.  Archer.  I\'m sure the board at the met will frown on this.  I\'m sure I don\'t care for your tone.  Well, I don\'t care to be judged by a couple of Lousy hooker baby havers! You were saying? You get him drunk, I\'ll go to the drugstore and get some supplies.  But you said I could hold him you\'ve been holding him and you\'ve been drinking and yer hands are so damn big! Don\'t wantcha to, um, crush him.  No, but I\'m gentle, I\'m soft, give her the rabbit, Lenny.  Okay.  Thank Wow, somebody\'s got a full diaper, huh? Ugh.  And after that falafel, I am right behind him Did you see me? Holding the baby? Looked like Tyson holding that dove.  Listen, bitch Ah! Careful, \'cause, in about three drinks, you\'re gonna get all boohooey, ask me to pump a baby into you.  Wh ?! No, you guys should totally do that! The mochachino ones are the cutest! Guess he\'d be half gay too, though So can you say best dancer ever?! No! Thank you, but I don\'t care for any! Cyril, it\'s a toast.  Don\'t be rude.  No! Alcohol tends to exacerbate an underlying Personality disorder! Sexual addiction\'s not a real thing, asshole! Well, just wait\'ll the new DSM comes out! Then we\'ll see! We\'ll see you still being an asshole! So, uh have you ever thought about having a baby? I dunno.  Sometimes I think, ya know, I\'d like to adopt a little baby So I could abandon it at the mall.  That answers my follow up question.  Cyril, you\'re insulting me.  A toast! And what is it to toast about about, anyway?! How bout that "upper decker" I just left in the master bath? C\'mon, Ray.  Sploosh, called it, three drinks ago.  C\'mon, we both have amazing genes Nobody\'s arguing we\'re both hot, but Ray, you can do it! And I can watch! The door.  Like a lookout, so nobody sees ya doin\' the dirt.  Oh, and also here\'s to child support! See ya around, Cyril.  And I\'ll see you at the lawyer\'s office, granny.  Toast, damn you! No! Toast! Jeezy petes, with you people! Well, at least I\'m not a sex addict! And cue the collective sigh of relief.  Oh, shut up.  Hey, I just ran all the way to the drugstore a liter low on blood, so I am in no mood.  Oh, and I am? Cyril won\'t drink, so we\'ll have to find another way to Woodhouse, dear? Yes, mum? I assume you\'re holding? Holding? Er, why, just this tray of Don\'t bullshit me, you old dope fiend! After that scrape I got you out of?! Let\'s liven things up, Burroughs Five grams of junk says I can shoot a pia colada off your wife\'s head! my stomach\'s never been the same! I shall fetch my gear What the hell was that?! Who knows? I didn\'t have a sip of water the entire time I was down there.  No! Maybe it was an ice cube Woodhouse! He\'s a heroin addict?! Oh, listen to you, mister judgy! Now, go lure Cyril into the bathroom so we can drain his stupid blood.  Cyril, you are not to blame.  You are merely a victim of sexual addiction.  Cyril, you are not to blame.  Preaching to the choir, buddy.  And what\'s that supposed to mean?! It means, I understand, because I, too, suffer from sexual addiction.  Oh, you\'re just a, dirty stomp around.  That\'s what society calls it! But you know how it is to be surrounded by women! Yes! Prancing around in their stirrup pants.  Crotchless panties.  I didn\'t know they had those.  Pretty sexy.  I have to take care of something! Medicine cabinet, Cyril, top left! Big bottle of coconut suntan oil! Man, I probably shouldn\'t be drinking this low on blood.  Whur you doona me? I brained him with the absinthe bottle.  Why? What was I to do, say "take a load off while we pump you full of heroin"? But if he was already knocked out?! Dear God, that was my entire stash! Going to be an itchy weekend Serves you right, smacky brown.  God, how are you even still alive? Holy shit, how am I still alive?! Eight gills is way more than I thought.  That\'s why you\'re so woozy.  Yeah, that, plus all those melon balls.  Had about nine of them.  Why the hell were you drinking?! Uh, hello?! It\'s a party?! It\'s a baby shower! For the bastard child you humped into a filthy whore! So I\'m obviously not saying now, but one of these days, you are gonna make just the best grandma ever.  Oh my God These ODIN dicks Hey, where\'d ya get your turtleneck? The turtleneck store? Wow, definitely missing that blood.  But maybe if I drank some of Cyril\'s blood, I\'d Wait, what am I saying? I don\'t even know his blood type.  But I do know a liter of melon balls can\'t replace a liter of blood.  Because I\'m kinda drunk for this oh nuts.  Fantastic.  What.  What\'re ya doin? Oh, ya know, just Livin the dream Lana.  Yeah? Well, I\'m goin through yer stuff.  Why are you still in my house?! Eh, there\'s still a few stragglers here, tryna keep the party goin Cyril.  Hey, you awake? Cause this is about to get weird.  Ants! Oh! Oh! So shut up and help me find the nutmeg, and I\'ll make you some Malcolm x tea! And ya know what\'s frickin lame? Phased plasma laser countermeasures? No, what\'s lame is you told me a jillion times ya never wanted kids, so I move on with my life, and then bam you drill one into a hooker.  Uh, it wasn\'t exactly planned, Lana.  Shut up.  But didja ever think about you and me, ya know, having a baby? No, not I mean, maybe that one time, when we had that little scare Wh ?! Is that a frickin candy bar?! Yeah, but think you need the calories? You are such a prick.  Who dragged out all this old crap?! Why are you and mother in my room, going through my things?! Because I\'ll save you some time My diary\'s by the Barbie playhouse, and the key\'s in a locket on Mr.  Teddy! My God, I haven\'t seen this junk in Look at that, his little baby shoes.  Can not picture him as a baby.  Ya know? I just see an adult him, but tiny.  Like a little Archer G. I.  Joe.  You want me to freshen that up? Mm Try not to drown it.  Aww, his little christening gown Pam! You Get off Cyril! I was tryin to get him off! *** Out! Out, just get straight on out! Aw, c\'mon! Cyril came on to me! Oh shut up! He\'s totally passed out! Really Hey, Cyril.  How\'s it hanging, buddy? His first pair of lacrosse cleats His first smoking jacket and, oh my His first black turtleneck! I can\'t believe Lana and mother.  No respect for people\'s privacy.  White ass daddy! Shit\'s tight, huh? Yo Where you at, mama? And why\'re you calling me right now?! I had to, before it\'s too late! I What?! I don\'t want you to do it, Sterling! What? I know you didn\'t plan on this baby, but Sterling, sometimes the unexpected things can turn out to be the most important things in the whole world! Wow, you sound shitfaced.  Oh, listen to you! Mr.  melon balls! And the yes, maybe I\'ve had a few.  And even though I was not always mother of the year, I can change! And you can change, and maybe together we could add up to one good parent for this baby. .  But I\'m, like, right here And I\'m right here for both of you.  Mother, I\'m not sure I\'m ready.  Sterling, no one\'s ever sure they\'re ready for a child.  That\'s why it\'s scary, and that\'s why it\'s so special.  So, please, dear, do the right thing.  God, the one time in my life she acts like a human being, and it\'s now? Was it when I wanted a puppy? No! Was it when I wanted cornrows? No! But maybe she\'s right I mean, the kid\'s cool, and I\'m obviously awesome, so Maybe I would be a good father.  Ya know, at some point in the future.  Waaaagh! Waaaagh! Aww, you\'re okay, taterhead.  They only took a little bit of blood.  Yeah, quit being such a baby.  You quit bein such a baby! You prick! Shut up! They took a liter from me! And as the 24 hours of uninterrupted vault footage shows, said liter was never except for those nine frames of static there out of sight of ODIN personnel.  We get it.  Let\'s move on, Barry.  And since you all witnessed the blood sample being taken from the wee baby Seamus I hereby cede any and all rights to ever contest the results of this paternity test.  Move on, Barry! And, so, said test results conclude Exciting, isn\'t it? Not really, because it\'s gonna say that Archer is, in fact, the father! What?! Wait a minute! No, that\'s Probably the most expensive candy bar you ever ate, ya dunce! Really super expensive.  That\'s a schedule for child support payments? First of the month works best for us.  No, wait! Somebody coulda broken in the vault! C\'mon, nine frames is a glitch! Because even if somebody did break into that vault, no one No one, Archer could ever prove it.  But And who\'d even want to? Not a handsome, blond, cripple like me.  So, kudos, buddy! Let\'s go drink some kudos! Yeah, let\'s do that! Clink, clink! I don\'t understand how this happened.  Well, from what I can tell, it had something to do with disgustingly kinky sex and a candy bar, but A candy bar? Mother! I am not the father.  It was Cyril? That thing is huge.  I mean how did you even get you sonuva snack eatin ass bitch! I\'m sorry! How can you cheat on Lana bareback?! I\'m a sex addict! That\'s not even a real thing! And the guilt from sex makes me binge, then I feel fat, then I turn to sex to feel attractive again, then it\'s just this vicious cycle! Shitass.  Don\'t you see?! The wee baby Seamus is Cyril\'s! And Barry just wanted to frame me! You don\'t fool me.  You had the chance to make the switch, but you couldn\'t.  No, yes I could! And I never thought I\'d say this, but Sterling You did the right thing.  No! I didn\'t! Well, the thing I thought was right, but not, ya know, what people think is right! Well, maybe you\'re turning into people.  But I don\'t wanna be people! And I didn\'t want to be a grandmother.  But c\'est la vie, dear.  Yeah, and c\'est la child support! Well, just tighten your belt.  My belt?! You said you were here for us! I am dear, but with the economy how it is What? My money isn\'t.  You\'re in a limousine! And if I wanted to sit around all day going nowhere, I\'d be a teacher! Sorry dear, I have a fitting.  Ciao! Fitting.  And that\'s why people in this family shouldn\'t have children.  That, and a genetic predisposition toward Ants! Wh ?! Wretched horrible ants! Ants are gonna be the least of your worries, smackhound Running around barefoot like that? Hello, hookworms! Get in my feet! Or whatever.  Some kinda worms.  Will go in your feet.Ahhh Oh man, is this great?   No Archer, it\'s   Was that a rhetorical question?   Archer Archer!   And also was that? Answer, yes, they both were, because New Orleans is my kind of town, and I haven\'t had a vacation in forever.    LANA Well, that\'s great but   Nola! The Crescents City!   The Big Easy   Our mission is to stop an eco terrorist from blowing up the biggest natural gas pipeline in North America, so I wouldn\'t exactly call it a vacation.  Well whatever, working vacation.  Cause I\'m not too worried about some drum circling hippie tree hugger.  Sir, can you find your seat for me? Yeah it\'s right there.  Can you go find some more hurricanes for me? Hippies aren\'t the only people who care about the environment.  Like, I happen to care.  A lot.  And so does our target Joshua Gray, aka Gandalf.  His name\'s Gandalf? And he\'s not a hippie? Gray\'s an ex Green Beret, and he\'s attacked nuclear power plants hydro electric dams, wailing ships Wailing ships? What? He\'s against clean burning lamp oil? Would you relax? We know he\'s gonna try to attack the pipeline, and we know where the pipeline is Yeah, running through a couple hundred miles of marshy wetlands.  So mobility will be key, Lana.  And how will we achieve mobility? Huh? An airboat, Lana! Just like Burt Reynolds in "White Lightning"!   Great, just   Not to mention "Gator"! Which, even though it\'s the sequel, I think is actually the stronger of the two films.  Just try to keep a low profile.  We could scare off Gray if we don\'t maintain the element of surprise.  Hey here\'s a surprise: This is Herms.  Ooh, and here\'s another one.    Remember Jerry Reed\'s character in Gator?   No.  Bama McCall? No.  Well whatever, check this out.  I stuh borrowed it from Woodhouse.  Archer, what the shit?!   Right? It\'s just like in Gator   Gun! Gun! Drop it, drop it! You drop it! Lana, hijacking! Dammit, it\'s not a Oh great, there better be more of those! Sky marshal! Drop your weapon!   Oh! Okay relax, it\'s okay, we\'re   Dut dut dut dut dut! Sterling Archer and Lana Kane of ISIS, and we\'re on a mission to stop an eco terrorist from blowing up a gas pipeline! So for the love of God, woman, go make me a fresh batch of hurricanes! Great.  Way to keep a low profile.  Thanks.  This is the AmPetCo gas pipeline Runs right underneath these swamps, supplyin\' almost twenty percent of America\'s liquid natural gas demand.    Right   But there\'s a pig launcher here Is that what it sounds like? It\'s a pipe inspection gauge, for cleaning the pipeline.  It\'s the only section above ground, so if Gray wants to attack our pipeline He\'ll have to do it there.  So we\'ll set up a defensive perimeter at the launcher, and catch him when he tries.  Well wait, hang on a second Can I get the oyster po\'boy and just like, a side of crawfish touffee? Cause I\'m not sure if I\'ll like it.  Archer.  No? Just an entree? Okay.  Oh, so the po\'boyHello?   Wow, speaking of disastrous   Speaking of shut up, think about what will happen to those fragile wetlands if that pipeline explodes! Screw the damn swamps, think what\'ll happen to AmPetCo\'s profit margin!   What?   Big money.  Huge tax credits from that hippie Democrat congress, just for making a few simple changes around here.  Well, a lot of these aren\'t so simple.  Replacing all the lights with high efficiency fluorescents, putting lowflow fixtures on all the plumbing Recycling old batteries?! Exactly, don\'t we do that already? Umm   Prrretty much   Good.  Because I\'m not leaving money on the table.  So to get these freebie socialist tax credits, we are going to make this place lean and green.  Typical corporate bullshit Thirty acres of wetlands disappear every day, but all you care about is how much natural gas you can pump out! Hey, we\'re just supplying a demand.  Yeah, AmPetCo\'s demand for huge profits! Well, some of those huge profits are paying ISIS to   protect that pipeline   Which I\'m only doing for the wetlands   Wetlands, profits, whatever   Yeah, sounds like a win win Just get out there and do your job! Yeah I will! If you will excuse me! I should go with her.  I don\'t think room service is coming.  Shoulda called first Cause dat\'s the only airboat around for fifty miles, and it\'s reserved.  What do you mean it\'s reserved? Is dat not self explanatory? Look, this is kind of an emergency.    Can we work something out?   Maybe.  Maybe use that money to buy a time machine, go back in time, and be the first person to reserve dat boat.  You sure about that?   Yup.    Good.  Cause I\'ve waited my entire life to say this exact phrase I\'m commandeering this airboat.  Sorry! It really is an emergency! Of an awesome and asskicky nature.  And some damn guard dog you is! Annie! Annie? Aw, well that\'s just great.  Now both my dogs is dead! Stupid efficient Canadian lightbulbs.  I can barely even see what I\'m doing.  What arya doin? I need six more of these.  Why do you need seven? One for each cat, duh! For God\'s sake, Pam! Have you no sense of decency?! That bathroom\'s like a, a war crime! Don\'t blame me, it\'s those new lowflow toilets! With the old ones you could flush a dachsund puppy! I mean, not that you would, but Well next time use the Dut dut dut dut! Women\'s restroom! The what? Thanks, Cyril.  Woooo! Seriously Lana, this must be what it\'s like to have sex with me! How can an airboat be selfish? Nope! Can\'t hear you, I\'m too happy! You can\'t hear me because you\'re redlining the engine! Thank you, certified airboat mechanic! Now where\'s the pig launcher thing? This heading, one mile!   But I\'m serious, if you don\'t slow down   I\'ll keep feeling this incredibly vibrant and alive! Yeah, right up until you blow the damn engine, so Lana! I am not gonna blow Try clearing your throat about a jillion more times, Lana, see if that helps.  No? Nothing? No no, by all means, let me do it You just sit there like the African Queen.  The African Queen was the boat.    What? No it wasn\'t, it was Audrey   Katherine.  Whichever Hepburn, she was the queen.  Of Africa.  Yeah.  The white queen of Africa.  Yeah, back then Hollywood was pretty weird about the whole race thing Like, Amos and Andy were white, a white guy played Charlie Chan   Archer   Pretty sure Tonto was a Jew   Stop! What? ! Gator?!   Gator?   Talking! But I wish there was a gator! Hey c\'mon, not even as a joke.    It so wasn\'t.    Look, I said I was sorry! Tell all this wildlife you\'re sorry when the pipeline blows up because we\'re not there to protect it! A, all this wildlife can suck it! Every thing out here either wants to eat me or give me malaria! And B No thanks to you, Queen Audrey.  Would you, just Okay, let\'s set up a defensive perimeter.  Yeah, right after I set up the grill.    Dammit Archer, will you   Hey! I just dragged this damn boat through a mile of my three biggest fears, so I think I\'ve earned a kabob! Well, too bad! Your lab uses more electricity than the rest of ISIS put together.  Yes, and I need every single watt!   No!   But, but I need We all have to pitch in to make ISIS green.  Loot at me, chopping ice for a Tom Collins like a field hand.    But   Ooh, or do I want a mint julep? But the slightest reduction of power to my lab could put lives at risk! Lives of what, a few lab rats? Also, yes.  Yeah, good, great idea Do the one thing that could possibly make it hotter.  Ya gotta sear \'em first, it locks in the flavor.  And if you\'re hot, and also somewhat bitchy, drink a beer.  I don\'t want a beer, I want water.  Your funeral.  God knows what kinda parasites are swimming around in it.  Not swamp water, ass, bottled!   Oh you are shitting me   I know, right? A rainbow should shoot out every time you open it.  You didn\'t bring any water?! Where would I have put it? Great, I\'ll just wait half an hour for a cup of ice to melt.    Dut dut dut dutm dut.    Oww, shit! What the [BEEP] shit is this? No, no, no, Lana.  It\'s dry ice! Hurry, put your hands in the swamp! Rrrgh! How ya doin, buddy? Because dry ice is something crazy like, negative a hundred degrees I need you, to not talk to me.  I know, and I know you\'re in a lot of pain, so just try to relax Why are you still talk ow! And say hi to Sister Morphine.  Morphine?! Dammit, I don\'t need That actually feels waaaay better.    Yeah?   Yeahhhh That actually feels better.  Good, then get up.  You\'re sitting on the beer.  Alright, so wait a second.  What\'re your three biggest fears? Nope.    C\'mon   No, hush, I\'m trying to fish.  No, don\'t shoot the fish.  C\'mon, this is a very fragile ecosystem.  Too fragile to spare one trout? No, but Or bass or whatever, what\'s in here? Nothing soon, if people like you keep destroying the environment.  Wh ?! It\'s one lousy fish! One lousy black rhino, one lousy Bengal tiger One lousy Lorax! Since when are you such a radical environmentalist? I\'m not radical.  Well, I mean not anymore.  Back in the day, though Fur is murder! Fur is murder! Fur is murder! Fur is murder! How\'s it feel to be a murderer?! Shall we find out? Lady, you don\'t scare me MALORY Dear, this is a forty four magnum.    You\'re really not scared, are you?   Newp.  Then how would you like a job? Three weeks later I was in Tunisia, killing a different man And how and why is that funny? Not that, I forgot about that afro.  Hey, ya know what? I know you looked like Angela Davis had a lovechild with Sweet Lou Dunbar.  Shut up You shut up, I\'m trying to catch us some dinner.    Well, if you\'d brought enough food   I wouldn\'t have had room   for beer, and I since I can\'t catch beer   Or a fish.  Yes I can.  Burt Reynolds is my spirit guide.  Did you say man crush? No, I\'m pretty sure it was shut up.  What\'re your three biggest fears? Getting stuck on a boat with you three times.  Ooh, here we go.  C\'mere fishy, fishy.  And while you eat humble pie with a side of crow, Lana I\'ll be dining on trout.  Waaaaagh! What the hell is that?! What the hell does it look like?! Shoot it! Shoot it! ARCHER Oh, so now it\'s okay?! What happened to your fragile ecosystem?! Screw the damn ecosystem, shoot! You are such a hypocrite! I bet you probably eat veal! Did you see that?! And hear that, what is that, what\'s that sound? Oh you are shitting me How did you shoot the boat?! Because I was bucking around like a rodeo clown in a barrel! Well did you hit the gator?! I dunno!   I mean, maybe   Great, so maybe he\'s wounded.  No, he\'s definitely wounded.  Oh right, I forgot he has an arrow, sticking out of his head! Yeah I think that\'s what enraged him.  And so now all twenty enraged feet of him is swimming around out there   In that inky black water   Into which we are currently sinking.  Yeah, it\'s not ideal.  I mean, even if we had more shells, You only brought two shells?! No, I brought shitloads, thank you! Well where are they?! In the gear bags With your guns.  And everything else.  Still got the cooler though, so Thank God for small miracles, huh? Lana.  Lana.  Lanaaaa! What?! I said thank God for small miracles.  I heard you.  I know.  Yeah, why dontcha have another one? Well, somebody\'s got to.    And since you refuse to help   You don\'t need help to get drunk! Oh please, it takes more than some three two Or, wow, six percent beer to get Sterling Archer drunk.  Six, really? Yeah, so lay off! There\'s a giant wounded alligator out there, not to mention a dangerous   eco terrorist   Holy shit, totally forgot about him.  I didn\'t But that\'s even more reason for you to get on board with my new plan! Is it as idiotic as your other plan? That\'s how brainstorming works, Lana!   It\'s free form, you come up with a lot of ideas   Yeah, like using the pipeline to set the entire swamp on fire.  Which, yes, bad idea, but it got me thinking about chemical reactions! Like alcohol\'s effect on the brain? No, like the reaction between solid carbon dioxide, also known as dry ice, of which we have plenty And a fun, sexy little molecule I like to call di hydrogen monoxide.    Water?   Water.  Combine them in a sealed container   and you\'ve got yourself   Some kind of dry ice bomb? Arrgh, yes, ruiner of explanations.  I was building to that, but yes.  Well, we got plenty of water.  No, the swamp\'s too dirty, it\'s full of whatever alligators shit out   which I can only assume it\'s people.    They don\'t eat people.    They eat people all the time.    They don\'t.  Last year, Sarasoni County Florida, Chett Willer, age 16, swimming in the Oak River Canal, killed by an 11 footer.  Two years ago, *** County, Georgia, Ruth Baker, age 39, killed in her back yard by a 10 footer.  Same year, Pinellas County Florida, Walter Jakes, age 70, and his dog, killed by a 12 footer.    Three years ago, Dade County   Archer! What?! What are your three biggest fears? Archer? Alligators, by far the biggest.  And so you\'ve memorized every fatal alligator attack? Just in the U. S. , I can\'t find any information on tacks in China.  They only live here and China.  Two different species.  Chinese alligators are smaller, but their bellies are fully armored so it kind of equals out and Can we change the subject?! Okay, what\'s your second biggest fear? God, will ya just it\'s crocodiles! Wait, do crocodiles even live here? Not here here, but in the Everglades.  That\'s like, a thousand miles away.  Well, three years ago they caught a 9 foot croc in the surf at Myrtle Beach so, ya know shit happens.  Wow.  Not sure I even wanna know what your third biggest fear is   Brain aneurysm.    What? What does a brain aneurysm have to do with walking around in a swamp?! Nothing, it can happen anywhere.  At any time.  That\'s why it\'s terrifying.  Oh my God okay, okay, so if the gator poop water is too dirty Yeah, we need distilled water.  Does your plan include finding some? Yes.  But.  But what.  You\'re not gonna like it.  Do we have to distill our pee? I guess you can if you want.    But I was just gonna use this   There was bottled water in there the whole time?! Yeah, I just forgot.  You forgot.  Thanks, idiot! What, you still would\'ve burned your hands reaching in here! Idiot! I hope an alligator attacks you at the exact second you have a brain aneurysm.  How could you even say that?! That\'s like me saying I hope you get cancer! What the hell is wrong with you?! I obviously don\'t! But holy shit, Lana I pour my heart out, and you just throw it right back in my face?   Sorry.    Well, you should be.  That\'s wait, okay, what\'s your biggest fear?   Newp.    Come on, I told you mine! I know.  You lose.    I think your biggest fear is intimacy   Ha.  When what you should be afraid of is falling in love with me again because of my awesomeness.  Check this out.  Wait, how do you light it? You don\'t, the pressure just builds up until it explodes.  How long does that take? Depends on how much water you add, we\'re gonna need to dial it in.  So you have no idea when that\'s gonna go off.  How could I? Aw, shit!   Asshole.    Did it getcha?   No!   Me neither.    Wow, again, small   Don\'t!   Miracles.    Rrgh! How long was that? Oh I\'m sorry, I forgot to time it! It\'s okay, I forgot to measure it.  So we\'re both gonna need to do better.  Every single one! To hell with the tax credits, I want every last one of those low flow toilets out! Dump them on the street with those ridiculous light bulbs.  Why do I have to carry the toilets? You know why.  Because of the things that come out of your body.  Oh shut up.  Mister Bigmouth, telling her we have a women\'s bathroom.  Where I better never catch you again! Okay! Jeez, hostile work environment.  Yeah, so everything\'s back to normal.  Is it?! I told you lives were at risk! Now behold the horror you have wrought! And Pam? If you\'re dumping stuff on the street? This can all go.    What is it?   Shattered dreams.  Smells like rotten meat.  Also, yes.  Yeah, there we go! Okay, I think we\'ve got the recipe figured out! Yeah, that was actually pretty great.    Duh!   Shut up!   You shut up! Okay, I\'ll get dry ice in the rest of the bottles, you be ready with the water, and we\'ll wait for that big fat stupid gator to come back.  Destroying his habitat isn\'t enough? What? I would\'ve been here sooner, but you stole my boat.  Do you not understand how reservations work, or? Reserve this, Treebeard! Oh please, it\'s not even loaded.    Wh ? Thanks Lana.    Shut up.    Hi, Josh.    Hello, Lana.  You know each other?! Josh was my Environmental Policy T. A.  When I was in college.  And her lover Also, yes.  Wait, I thought he was a Green Beret! I went to grad school on the G. I.  bill.  And that\'s when I realized I had to lead the fight against the systematic rape of Mother Nature.  But back then you just organized peaceful protests Like that day at the fur store where you disappeared without a trace.  I guess I kinda found my calling.  What, as a hired gun for the military  industrial complex? A traitor to the cause of environmental protection? Me? ! What about you?!   Always running around, blowing shit up   Threatening our supply   of lamp oil   Shut up, but Josh seriously, do you really think the ends justify such violent means? Yes! Because this is a war! And victory will only come when Americans will stop destroying the Earth just so they can drive bigger cars, build bigger houses, and eat bigger food!   So like, never.    Yeah.    Oh my God, that\'s depressing   Sorry.  And I\'m also sorry we can\'t let you blow up this pipeline.  I wasn\'t going to.  Well then why I mean I was, but I saw you with this idiot, yelling on the plane about working for ISIS.  So technically I saved the pipeline! Yeah, you\'re the best.  ARCHER Whatever, I win.  Suck it, Samwise.    Archer   So, you need a lift back to land?   Yeah, lemme just grab my cooler and   Not you! Ass.  Lana? Maybe we can grab dinner, see some Dixieland jazz? That sounds lovely.  Oh c\'mon, are you kidding me?! You\'re really gonna leave me out here?! Yup! I like your new hairdo, by the way.  Well if you like the collar, you\'re gonna love the cuffs Well that\'s just great.  She gets dinner and Dixieland and laid, and I get mosquitos and no beer and not laid.  How could this get any w Lemme finish, worse? Now, okay see, you ruined it.  You ruined the moment.Woodhouse, what the hell is this?! I believe it is squash, sir.  I what\'re you shoveling it into?! The wee baby Seamus.  Miss Trinette said you\'d agreed to it, while she\'s in Atlantic City for the weekend What?! For the "Pimps and Ho\'s Ball," I believe she said.  Didn\'t seem the sort of place one takes a baby.  You realize you\'re in huge trouble Yessir And that now I have to spend my first Friday off in like, forever Yessir Devising some bizarre punishment for you.  Yessir.  So don\'t be surprised if you end up eating a whole bunch of spiderwebs.  Right? Now shut up and read me the paper.  Very good, sir, let\'s see what we Good Lord! Oh for what the shit, Woodhouse?! Stop crying! How do you make him not God, here! Ya like that? That\'s a Bloody Mary.  Or is it a Bloody Caesar?! Why\'re you sitting? At my table?! I the paper sir, there\'s an item Oh yeah? Did somebody finally out the Queen? Right? This baby know what I\'m talking about.  Gimme that.  Sir Augustus Stilton, World War One flying ace, blah blah blah, dies under mysterious circumstances.  And mystery solved, he was a thousand.  Stilton and I were squadron mates Oh.  Sorry.  Twenty Two Squadron, RFC.  Most decorated aerodrome of the Great War.  I don\'t care about the great war.  But not much left of the old Double Deuce anymore.  We\'re all dying off Yeah, not a huge surprise.  We\'re not dying of old age, sir Wait a second.  Sir Alfred Wensleydale, foul play suspected Nigel Buxton, mysterious circumstances Edwin Glue sester Gloster Whatever, foul play suspected another "mysterious circumstances, every one of these is like that, and they\'re all from the past six months.  What the hell? Hell indeed, sir.  Because one at a time, the remaining survivors of the old Double Deuce are being murdered.  Oh my God.  Are we out of Bloody Marys?! Can not picture you as a fighter pilot.  Oh no sir, not a pilot.  A batman.  An officer\'s personal attendant.  In charge of keeping his kit in good order, seeing to his personal needs So, a servant.  "Soldier servant" was the official term, but Yeah, Way to advance.  But for the enlisted, being chosen to bat for an officer was very desirable.  Especially when that officer was Captain Reginald Thistleton.  I say, Woodhouse! Yessir.  The Hun did a fair job of stitching up the old kite this time, what? Thank God you\'re alright, sir.  God and my twin Vickers, caught old Jerry in a chandelle, poor bastard went down like a quail.  You scoundrel! Is that brandy?! Thought you\'d like a pick me up, sir.  You\'re a rose among thorns! Bagged your share today, Scripes? Loads, thanks! See you\'ve already bagged yours Creepy Yes, Leftenant Scripes abhorred the way Reg Er, Captain Thistleton carried on with the men.  Yeah, didn\'t Oscar Wilde get hard labor for that? For what are you talking about? I\'m what\'re you talking about? The tontine France.  Spring, 1917.  Bloody April, they called it Black days, they were.  We were losing two, sometimes three pilots a week.  Who was that? Foxley, I should think.  No one thought we\'d live through the war, so Reggie came up with the idea.  A tontine, lads! Each man pays in fifty pounds, and the last survivor collects the capital and interest.  Oh come on lads, show some stones! I\'ll show you my stones, sir! That\'s the spirit! Who else? Well done Johnny, Bob\'s your uncle.  So, how much are we talking here? Oh, nearly twelve hundred pounds.  What?! Nobody\'s getting killed over how ever much that is in real money! Well no, but are you familiar with the term "compound interest?" I\'m not an idiot, Woodhouse.  Unlike some people around here! That\'s silvertip badger! You know how much this cost?! No no, hey c\'mon, don\'t Here, God, Baby.  But since I don\'t have a calculator At ten percent, by now I\'d say it\'s just a bit shy of a million dollars.  What?! I would totally kill you for that! Not me, but ya know, somebody would So how many of you geezers are left? Well, now that\'s Stilton\'s been killed, it\'s just me, Scripes, and And that\'ll be Stinky.  Wh ? What will?! Cor, you done alright then.  Oh, no, the flat belongs to Mr.  Archer, who is my None of my business Consenting adults and so on.  Hey, nobody\'s consenting to anything! None of my business! You\'re gonna eat so many spiderwebs That\'s what he said Scripes phones me at my niece\'s house in Secaucus, New Jersey I live with my niece in Secaucus, New Jersey Riveting  Says innit it awful about Stilton, and he wants to come pay us a visit! Good Lord! What\'d you say?! Gave \'im your address! Told the bastard we\'d be waitin for \'im! Waiting for him?! My God, he\'ll Never know what hit \'im! We\'ll turn this fruity flat into a killing field! But Seamus, no! Huh uh! Woodhouse, I can either do God, you are such a little brat! Here! I can do baby, or I can do "geezer murder mystery," but I can\'t do both.  Well Scripes is on his way here, so So sir? Perhaps your mother could look after the wee baby Seamus? Woodhouse, yes.  No! Yes! Mother c\'mon, you said you You\'re off your nut if you think I\'m babysitting this squawling little What the hell is wrong with him?! He miight have a tiny hangover.  Wh ? You ass, you gave him liquor?! No, I didn\'t give it to him, but Ass.  See, look at him he\'s just crazy for it.  You\'re only supposed to give them liquor if they have the croup! Well I\'m sorry Mister Spock, I Or colic! Or the jimmy legs! Or can\'t you just dump him on Woodhouse? No, because That\'s what I always did.  I am sure you did, but apparently Woodhouse is about to be murdered, So are you, if you piddle in here! And that goes double for number two, Mister Man! So you just hold it in! Wow.  A ton of stuff just started making sense to me.  The secret is negative re enforcement.  Yeah, I\'m just getting that.  About time.  Ass.  Baby, you\'re pear shaped.  Oh, what the hell! Hello?! Great, that was my second favorite lamp.  Reloading! No you\'re not! Don\'t reload.  Dammit! Ow.  And my first favorite lamp, fantastic.  Serves you right, shooting blind like that.  You could\'ve killed me.  Yeah, and I\'d be that much closer to a million bucks! Ya know, once um What\'s up with your will the days? Oh my God Since when is this place a nursery?! Wouldja knock it off, Union Carbide?! And lay off the wee baby Seamus.  He\'s got it tough enough as it is Wussat! A pwetty bumblebee! Ya wanna pwetty bumblebee? There you go! Aww, wassamatter? What happened? Did somebody trick you? Hm? See? That\'s how the world works, dear and I\'m the only one you can trust.  Wow A ton of stuff just started making sense.  No way.  Why not? Mr.  Archer said Woodhouse might make a million bucks from his! Shut up, liar.  Of things impossible.  It\'s not Cyril, can you explain compound interest to her? Maybe if we had an infinite amount of time.  And she were someone else.  Muh huh huh huh.  Wait a second, is that a you know tontines are illegal, right? So is all kindsa shit! But lookit these odds! Half the people that work here are field agents, Who get killed in the line of duty all the time! And the control room Is basically just a great big asbestos lawsuit waitin to happen Yeah, here\'s some more claims forms And how long ya think this one\'s gonna be around? Yeah.  Yeah, count me in.  No.  Yes! We must fortify our position! We need twin Vickers here by the bar, a Lewis gun by the sofa Mustard gas! Zeppelins! No! The guy\'s a hundred, he\'ll probably break both his hips pushing the doorbell.  I don\'t know, sir.  Scripes was the toughest man in the squadron Just the squadron, or the entire Pansy Division? Ow! By God, you will show some respect! Do as you like with me, but I won\'t have a swishy party boy backchat a war hero! War hero? Oh, let\'s not Who, Woodhouse?! Damned right! *** And if you won\'t tell him, Woodhouse, I bloody well shall! Alas, poor ReggieHe was on his way back from a routine patrol.  It was a Tuesday afternoon I\'d written him a letter, you see, so I was waiting out on the field And he was looking at me   my God, I can still see his smile   when that Hun bastard dove in from behind And then the sky just shattered.  God knows how, but he kept the old kite from rolling over And crash landed, out in No Man\'s Land And?! Hm? Then what?! Oh.  Well, Reggie survived the crash somehow Aaagh! I survived the crash somehow! So we could\'ve sent a rescue party.  But with Reggie hors de combat, Scripes had become acting commander And there shan\'t be any rescue party.  Captain Thistleton knew the risk of what he was doing, and now it seems his chickens have come home to roost.  Bawk bawk, a response I found unsatisfactory.  I could hear Reggie, out there past the wire, screaming like a lamb Aaaagh! I\'m coming for you, sir! And there I found him, in the words of Henley, "bloodied but unbowed. " Woodhouse, you came for me! Of course I did, sir! I\'m a Fag? Sir? Have you got one? Dying for a smoke Oh! Yes of course sir, here we are Cheers.  Now let me just light that for you Oops.  Sorry, sir Just give that another go Good man.  Damn! Good God, man, are you hourly? I sorry, sir, I here we go.  Woodhouse God, that\'s bright there\'s something I\'ve been wanting to tell you, but You scoundrel! Izzat brandy?! Oh, no sir, just water Water?! No, never touch the stuff, fish [BEEP] in it.  But seriously I\'ve wanted to tell you this for ages, but I never quite knew how I\'m listening, sir Woodhouse Fish [BEEP] in it.  After that, it\'s all a bit fuzzy.  Reggieeeeeeeee! And then what? Then they gave me the VC and my papers medical discharge.  Because of the scalps.  Oh for The what?! German scalps! Must\'ve been fifty of \'em! Could\'ve made a blanket.  And then I just sort of drifted about.  Spent God knows how many years in the Orient, on a merchant schooner Reggieeeeeeeee! Then I sort of washed up in Tangiers, where I won a bar in a dice game Which is how I met your mother.  Don\'t shoot! Please.  I just killed a man and I think my water just broke.  So I could really, really use a drink.  Gave birth to you right there on that greasy bar.  I cut the cord, and I\'ve been with your family ever since.  The you Oh my God, you you saw Mother\'s vagina?! Oh, my God! Aaah! Oh my God.  Rrrghh! What an ass.  Right? Mother?! Mother, where are you?! In here you half wit! I had just gotten him to sleep! Don\'t you know anything about babies?! I know you\'re not supposed to have \'em on a greasy bar! In Tangiers! Oh my God And I know you\'re not supposed to let Woodhouse see your lady parts! Wh ? That\'s why you\'re so upset?! Yes! Eww! Mother he touches my food! Darling, he also Give me that! He also saved my life.  And yours.  Between my narrow hips, your fat head, and a city full of enemy spies We both nearly died that night They\'re sure to come here looking.  We should get you somewhere safe.  Oh, a few minutes more.  I just want to look at him.  Isn\'t he perfect? Aye.  Here, Miss for the lad.  It\'s beautiful A clapped out old whore traded it for a pint.  Said it was sterling.  Sterling.  That\'s what I\'ll name him! Oh, that\'s a fine name.  And could could his middle name be Reginald? No.  Little too gay, but Nicht bewegen! Sie sind verhaftet! But how would you like a job? I I think I would like it very much indeed, mum.  Oh my God And if that weren\'t enough, that very night he traded his bar for a boat and sailed us to Lisbon.  Got me to an OSS safehouse, sold the boat, used the money to get you both back home to States, then raised you by himself for five years! Wwwhaat? You heard me, young man.  Your mother\'s just home from the war, boy.  Give her a proper hello.  No! I don\'t have a mother! And if I did, I\'d I\'d hate her! Wow, he did all that? For You.  And you treated him like a dog ever since.  But you won\'t have him to kick around forever Oh shit! Woodhouse! Oh my God, he\'s gonna be murdered! I gotta go save him! Ah ah ah! Here.  You want me to take a baby.  To a murder.  Or wherever, just out of here.  I have no more love to give today.  Yeah what is it, like, two thirty? Wait, why\'d you have an eyepatch? Oh, who remembers? Three large, three large fitty, threelarge a Benjamin, three large Idiots, doing idiot things because they\'re idiots Yeah, we\'re the idiots.  Says the genius who got a hooker pregnant What? Nothing! Cyril, what? Cyril? You dead? Damn.  Should I put him out of his misery? Nehh Do you, though.  I No, wait, then I won\'t get the money.  Idiot.  You\'ll never take us alive, Scripes! What do you mean, take you alive, Woodhouse I only came here to Wh ?! Bloody hell! Ow.  Dreadfully sorry about that, old boy.  Bloody should be.  Almost killed me.  Which again, from the bottom of my heart, is the last thing on earth I\'d ever want to do.  I\'d forgotten all about that rubbish tontine But All the mysterious deaths I daresay there\'s not much mystery They\'re just desperate to sell newspapers.  Gloucester fell off the roof mucking about with the aerial, Wens and Bux died in their sleep at the pensioners\' home.  And as for Stilton There\'s no nice way to put it.  Auto erotic asphyxiation.  You\'re joking! No.  Stilton was always quite keen on that.  Remember? Always looking for something sturdy to loop his Sam Browm ne over? I do seem to recall an awful lot of loose doorknobs.  Oh, plus what he named his plane.  I always thought that had something to do with the engine.  Well Here\'s to you, "Choke and Stroke. " To "Choke and Stroke!" And here\'s to the old Double Deuce.  God knows we had our differences, but it was I\'m just, I\'m just so glad to see you both.  But if you didn\'t come to kill us, why bring that whacking great Webley? It\'s Reggie\'s.  I stole it from his effects.  I looked everywhere for that Damned wretched of me, but I just wanted a memento.  But Reggie would\'ve wanted you to have it, old boy I say, that\'s damned decent of you.  Cheers.  Took good care of her, too.  Look.  No rust.  Even the barrel\'s clean.  Noooooooo! Look ouuuuuuuuuut! Oh my Gawwwwd! The baybeeeeee! Rrrrgh! Nooooooo! I\'m coming, Reggieeeeee! Whooo! What a move! Did you see that? That was like, like Steve McQueen and John Woo had a baby, and that baby was you, baby.  Yeah pretty hot, huh? Oh my God! You, you! No, don\'t thank me, thank the Ass! Unbelievably gigantic! Ass! Hey! Scripes wasn\'t here to kill us! He came to mourn our comrades in arms! Oh.  Oh?! That\'s all you have to say, you great flapping twit?! Oh?! Hey! Seriously Corporal Bishop! Give him the Webley! The what? What\'s a web Thank you, Corporal Bishop.  The pleasure was all mine Lance Corporal Woodhouse.  Damn shame he\'ll send you packing when he comes to.  Oh, I\'ll just yank his pants off, splash a lot of scotch and women\'s underthings about then tell him he slipped and fell, chasing a terrified Asian prostitute out onto the patio.  It\'s not the first time I bashed his head in and had to cover my tracks.  Happens three, four times a year   Roy?   Well Guess you and me are the last two left in the tontin, eh? Yeah.  I guess we are.  Hard to believe, eh? Well, we were the two youngest.  No, no, not that.  The fact that the Government let you two fruit batch adopt the baby.I am the target.  I am the target.  I am the target.  Then go already! Ya big bag with which one douches.  I\'m sorry, what\'s that? I can\'t hear you Over the sound Of my deafening awesomeness.  Women Oh, I hate him so much.  Three hundred bucks, ladies! Come render the salad unto Caesar! Whoa whoa whoa! Huh uh! We\'re still in the lead.  Well yeah, but just by one.  And? And Cyril\'s got three throws left to get two measly points! For the win.  Exactly.  Are you shitting me?! Will you shut up?! Ignore him, forget those first two darts, and just find your center.  Maybe it\'s in your vagina C\'mon, Cyril! Whassa matter? Can\'t perform under pressure? I Could you repeat that, please? Onomotopoeia.  O, N, O, M O, T, O Pee? Geezie Petes.  You idiot! How could you miss that?! How could he not? He\'s Cyril! C\'mon ladies, I\'m buyin! Way to go, Chokely Carmichael.  Hey Pam, wait up! C\'mon, get me drunk enough, and I might have sex with you.  Really?! No, it\'s a Catch 22.  The amount of alcohol I\'d need would literally kill me.  But I do wanna see how many pool balls can fit in your mouth.  My record\'s three Come on, buddy You want a drink? Not even some vinegar and water?! With friends like that, eh? Hm? Your friends.  Well, they\'re not really my friends, we just work togeth Oh, hello ISIS, you said? I No, I didn\'t say that.  Well, somebody must\'ve.  Champagne? George, by the way.  George Spelvin.  Cyril Figgis.  And thank you.  Neh, thank me tomorrow After Cyril Figgis saves the day.  I dunno what Mother\'s so mad about, but God, Pam, would you hurry up? Would you shut up?! Frickin head\'s poundin, I\'m sweatin booze, and my mouth is killin me.  You\'re the one who stuffed four pool balls in it.  Personal best! Your mother must be so proud Yeah, oh wait, she\'s dead.  And what\'s up with your mother? What comes after infuriated? Great, that\'s what I need, coming off a blackout drunk.  Yeah, the last thing I remember was I don\'t know, were we super bitchy to Cyril? Yeah, that sounds about right.  Great, now he\'s gonna be moping around like Droopy Dawg on downers for Morning, gang! Jeez Archer, what\'s got your mom so darn worked up? This! Krieger? And the damn thing is spreading! To every computer in the office! Do you think this is funny?! Do you not? Nobody can do any work! Yeah, so can we go home? Absolutely! Right after you idiots de worm the entire computer network! How\'re we supposed to do that?! Well, I could take a crack at it Don\'t! Touch it! Cyril! Go do whatever it is you do Like suck at stuff.  And leave this to people who are more qualified.  At not sucking at stuff.  Cyril, beat it! Krieger is on this! I think.  I mean, least I have a Hunch, hunch! What, what?! Ahem.  Inappropriate.  What do you mean? No, I mean the first part worked.  I snuck into the mainframe last night, after all the champagne and the, uh Handjobs.  Yeah, The twins are quite fond of you.  I loaded that into the mainframe Splendid! Then open your dish! But part two, where I use your secret code to kill the worm and kinda, be the hero for once, that didn\'t happen.  Don\'t worry about it, open your dish.  No thanks Cyril.  I got that specially for you, and quite frankly you\'re insulting me.  Now open.  Your dish.  Sorry George, I didn\'t mean to be George there\'s money in there! Oh good, for a second I thought they\'d brought you chicken toes or something.  George why is there money in there?! Cyril, I\'ve been just a teeny bit less than honest with you.  Oh no No now, it\'s nothing sinister.  I design computer security systems.  CIA, MI 6, ODIN, all the biggies.  You must be pretty good at it.  Too good, that\'s the problem.  My systems can\'t be hacked, so now I can\'t convince anyone to upgrade.  Which is why I designed this.  And thanks for helping me test it.  If it\'s that easy on an XL 9 network like the one at ISIS, I think I can convince my clients they\'re at risk.  Wh ? ! What kind of risk?! Not from this! It\'s just a cute little pirate.  But it shows there are flaws out there that can be exploited.  By bad people.  Trust me, it\'s for the greater good.  Yeah, I guess it just seems Look, if you\'re uncomfortable taking the fifty grand, I\'ll just No no! Fifty grand?   Wow No, I mean, as long as it\'s for the greater good   Oh, it is.  And as long as I can still, ya know, swoop in and save the day OK That might be a problem.  Ya think?! I do.  Because now the worm is in the mainframe databanks, and Dammit, Pam! Sorry! I was just checkin to see if it\'s still doin it! Of course it\'s still doing it! "Hunch, hunch!" What, what? Pam! That\'s not me! Yes it is! Pam, I swear to God! Yeah, quit screwing around, Pam! This is serious.  Very.  Because if the worm gets into the mainframe\'s encrypted files Holy shit! The identity of every single ISIS field agent is on there! So what? Because most secret agents don\'t tell every harlot from here to Hanoi that they are secret agents! Then why be one? "Hunch, hunch! What, what?" Just turn off the mainframe! Yeah, we tried that Then how is it still on?! Because the worm has transformed the mainframe into a sentient being! What?! I\'m kidding, there\'s a battery backup.  Yeah.  Over there.  Behind about two tons of steel, and one electronic lock.  Which is controlled by the mainframe.  Well what genius thought that up?! This one.  Sorry! And where the hell have you been? On agency business.  At the bank.  Sesame Ginger Savings and Loan? What\'s all this? This, is the backbreaking work we\'ve been doing, while you were getting takeout from your stupid Chinese bank! Every single one of these has to be wiped, reformatted, the whole shmeel.  What? But it\'s just a little cartoon pirate! Was.  But it mutated, and now we\'re like, on the brink of World War Two.  Three.  It\'s not a competition, Pam! Well, is it or isn\'t it?! I don\'t know! I mean, the mainframe thinks they\'re nuclear missile launches, but it\'s so screwed up "Hunch, hunch! What, what?" Sorry! Case in point, there\'s really no way to be sure.  So what am I supposed to do, just look out the window?! No, you don\'t wanna be anywhere near a window.  Same thing in a tornado.  And they can\'t even turn off the stupid mainframe because some stupid battery thing is in some stupid vault.  But they don\'t need to turn off the Darn it, I can fix this! Oh please, he couldn\'t fix dinner.  He doesn\'t need to, with a bank like Not a real bank.  Dammit! Sorry But I have no idea how to open this thing.  Not really my legerdemain.  You mean bailiwick? I dunno, whatever, look out.  What\'re you Archer, no! For the love of God, man! You massive ssshole! I\'m sorry, I thought that would work! Really.  No, look at that thing.  It\'s like it\'s made out of Wolverine\'s bones.  You know Cause they\'re Does nobody read X Men?! So hey, how about I take a crack? I bet I can kill that pesky old worm.  How? Ya gonna disappoint it to death? Hey, ya know what?! Yes, I do.  Beat it Cyril, let the grown ups work.  But leave this, I\'m starving.  No! Gimme that! Hey, wait a damn minute! I said I was hungry.  Great.  Rrrrungh! There, now we don\'t have to re format all those stupid things.    Brilliant.    Right? Totally.  Because how\'s the elevator supposed to work with a jillion pounds of frickin computers on it?! Who am I, Elisha Otis? C\'mon, pick up pick up pick up Cyril.  What\'s going on with you? Nothing\'s going on! Hi, you\'ve reached George Spelvin, por Espanol Hated that phone.  Always dropping calls.  Probably holding it wrong.  Oh yeah, just like Cyril Figgis always does everything wrong, is that what you mean?! Basically.  Well for your information, Cyril Figgis knows how to beat the worm! I bet.  The computer worm! Krieger can\'t even beat it! Krieger, who\'s virtual girlfriend is so real the state of New York is allowing him to legally marry her! Oh, Kureega san! Soon we will to be married, yes? Very soon, my little cherry blossom Would you please! Focus! Nooooo! Kureega san! Nooooo! You maniac! You blew her up! Oh, damn you! God damn you all to hell! So how\'s this going? Not great.  The worm\'s decrypting the ISIS agent list and then, apparently, it\'s going to upload them to an off site server.  Oh my God Plus now I\'m going to die alone.  And once the worm decrypts the cover list and uploads it   to whoever is behind this foul deed   every ISIS agent in the field will be exposed.  And probably killed.  Oh my Archer, do something! Who am I, Alan Turing? Also from X Men.  Sterling! What?! Are we keeping you from something? No.  Well? Well what? Cyril was just right here Like, one second ago.  So where are we, what\'s the plan? I\'m going to sell it.  The Russians, maybe the North Koreans famine or no, they\'ve got a shitload of money.  But you can\'t do that! One moment, darlings Of course I can.  Once my little worm uploads the list to my server.  But it\'s not yours! You stole it! Bought it.  From you.  Well, then sell it back to me! Can\'t.  You just said you could! Well "won\'t" then, whatever.  Look.  Take the money back! Here\'s the almost fifty thousand! Count it! You\'d still be about three zeros short.  Fifty million?! Seller\'s market.  But that\'s not fair oww! It is exactly fair! You made a choice! And just like every other choice that every other human being has ever made, it has a consequence! But I just wanted to show them I could Them?! Or maybe your father, who never thought you quite measured up! He how did you know that?   Just a guess really.    Okay okay, what if what if I get you the fifty million? One is inclined to ask how.  Well I happen to be a kickass accountant! Did that sound a lot better in your head? Yes it did.  Damn, thas over half the cover list! Krieger, we don\'t have much time! Can you stop the worm or not?! Oh I thought we were putting all our eggs in the battery shutdown basket.  No, it could take hours for this thing to bypass the electronic lock! Well then I better get my turtleneck.  Archer! Hey so, uh you busy? Yes! Or no, I dunno.  Who\'s asking? You, Cyril, are a [BEEP] idiot! I just wanted to show everybody I could perform under pressure! And just for once, be the guy who oww! Who what?! Betrays the agency?! And then begs me to save you?! No, not me! All those field agents! Rrgh! How much did he pay you? Fif orty thousand? Cyril.  Fifty thousand.  Mine.    But I already spent like, three thousand on new suits, and shoes and   Mine.  Take the suits to my tailor and the shoes to my shoemaker.  You have a shoemaker? Do you not? I am unbelievably angry right now.  That\'s good, you should channel that.  Onto Spelvin, whose fault this is.  Shut up and break it down for me.  You\'ve been inside, what\'s the layout? Well, let\'s see uh, it\'s pretty big What\'s the floorplan! Where\'s the primary ingress! Orientation! Are there windows, do they face west, can we use the sun to our advantage?! I\'m pretty sure it has windows Gimme the gun.  No, why? We\'re here, idiot.  Oh.  Once you\'re in, give this to Spelvin.  It\'s full of counterfeit bearer bonds.  Where\'d you get counterfeit bearer bonds.  Don\'t open it! There\'s a canister of knockout gas wired to the latch.  Cool Duh.  Okay, try not to screw Wait, it\'s just Spelvin up there, right? Um Cyril.  There\'s probably two incredibly sexy Asian women in bikinis? Oh.  I\'m suddenly much less angry.  Well, you say that Dammit, the worm\'s got the list! How long will it take to upload it to the server?! I dunno, maybe five hours? Oh good, then we\'ve got some time Or minutes, look I\'m a little busy.  Gettin back in the ol\' dating game.  Yep! Fifty million dollars in real bearer bonds! Which are um, real.  Unbelievable.  Well, like I said Literally.  I don\'t believe you.  Just open it up and look! At what, Cyril? A big spritz of knockout gas? Apparently not.  Exactly! Because I don\'t even know if that\'s a real thing! Okay, Spelvin, where\'s the ISIS cover list? Over there, on the server.  Where\'s the Hellooo, kitties Listen, if you\'re not busy after, we should go grab a drink or Wh ?! Dammit, Cyril! Remember to channel it! You said they were sexy! Ninjas are sexy! Right? I mean I think so.  Look, I don\'t want to hurt you ladies So how about we all just put our swords down and You don\'t have a sword.  Can I? Sure, why not.  Keiko, katana! Well now she doesn\'t have a We\'re just set on doing this, huh? Yes, we are.  Gotcha.  That was a gift.  Shut up.  Come on.  Sorry in advance for this.  Wait wait, stop! Stop.  Do you hear that?! Hear what?! That crunching noise? Do you hear this?! No no no, hang on, don\'t aaaghhh! *** Shit! I think so.  Cyril, get the [BEEP] gun! Okay You\'re bringing this on yourself! Any time now, Cyril! Pity Probably have to knock five percent off my asking price for the list More than that, I bet.  Seller\'s market.  Wait wait, stop! Stop! Do you hear that?! No, you tit, the only thing I hear is D drop it, Spelvin! Oh Cyril I\'m warning you! Shoot him! But just him, I think the twins are warming up to me.  Right, you guys? Am I getting some signals? Shut up.  Make me.  Cyril, we both know you can\'t do it.  Y yes I can! Then go ahead, Cyril shoot! Just him though! Right? II Don\'t have it in you.  Don\'t have it now, didn\'t have it when you were a wheezy, four eyed little kid, trying to impress daddy.  How did you fail him? Was it sports? I was all conference lacrosse.  Pretty demanding sport, pretty tough on the *** This one knows what I\'m talking about, right? I see you checking him out.  No not sports, lookit you, shoulders like a trout.  Spelvin What? What was the failure that forever killed the love in your father\'s heart? Regional spelling bee.  Holy shit You suck at everything! Oh, it\'s not his fault, he just You whinging little shit.  You just cost me fifty million dollars! But I\'m gonna get my money\'s worth in Ah ah! I\'ve still got one bullet.  Does he? Who am I, CountBulletsula? Like Dracula? That was bad.  Come back to me, I can do better.  I will come back to you.  Because even if you do have one left, you can\'t shoot all three of us.  No.  Just you.  All right, fair enough.  C\'mon girls.  Hey, call me if you ever wanna get that drink.  Either of you, both, whatever.  Unless the sister thing is weird for you.  I\'m obviously way into it.  Alright, Archer you win this round.  No shit, Spelvin.  Well technically I won it, but Jeezy Petes, Archer! Coulda sworn you only fired six.  You coulda blown my foot off! Yeah which you totally deserve after what you did! I\'m sorry, okay? And I promise, I\'ll never do anything like that again! So So what? So do you have to tell anybody? Depends.  You learn anything? Oh God yes, I did, I swear, I learned a huge, valuable lesson that I will remember for the rest of my life! Which you will spend never knowing if I\'m gonna rat you out.  What?! Yeah.  So now what\'d you learnn? To never confide in you? There ya go.  See? As long as you learn something from it, it\'s not a mistake.  Okay WhereArcher, where are you going? Well judging from the decor, I\'m guessing Spelvin\'s got one of those kickass Japanese soaking tubs.  Wh ? ! After all that, you wanna take a bath?! Do you not?She\'s battled ivory poachers, raging rivers, even tuberculosis and now Oscar winner Rona Thorne takes on the CIA and the KGB in Dietrich Viener\'s new thriller "Disavowed!" Ohmigod it\'s going to be amazing, I play a spy accused of being a double agent so she has to clear her name and I read Dietrich\'s script and I was like, lookit me, I was like "waaaaagh!" so it\'s just going to be amazing.  Oh my God, she\'s amazing! Eh, I dunno That\'s because you\'re an idiot Who obviously never saw "River\'s Rage. " I saw it, but I was just like "ehh. " Wh ? ! Are you nuts?! That scene when her baby gets swept away?! Bawled so hard they made me leave the theater, never saw the ending.  Well, they find the baby Aaah! Don\'t tell me!   Dead.    Dammit! Yeah, jammed up under a log Oh and that wet clingy shirt she wears the whole time?! Nippletooown! Ohmigod that river was so Cold! Waaaaagh! Waaaaagh! Why? ! Are we screaming?! Do you know who you are?! I dooo! I do I do I do and I\'m also supposed to be meeting Malory Archer? Come in dear, come in And the rest of you, don\'t you have something better to do than stand around all day and shriek?   No.    Noooope.  I\'m sorry, that sounded like no.  Lana, she has to research her role This isn\'t, whatever, the sheriff\'s department where you get to wear a windbreaker and go on a ride along.  This is highly classified covert ops Yes! Covert ops! That\'s exactly the kind of spy lingo I want to soak up! What part of "highly classified" do you not understand? All of it! That\'s why I\'m here doing research, so you can teach me! Which she will be happy to do.  Wait a minute.  What\'re you getting out of this? Wh ? Nothing! Well, apart from a small consideration from the studio Uh huh.  Which we\'re still negotiating, but Who\'s your agent, by the way? He\'s not taking new clients, and Lana please, you have to have to have to help me.  No I don\'t don\'t don\'t, and I\'m not Not really qualified.  I\'m sorry? It\'s not your fault, Lana.  I on the other hand, am qualified, since I happen to be the world\'s greatest secret agent.    But you\'re a man.    And then some.  So obviously he can\'t give you a woman\'s perspective like I can,   so yes, I will be happy to help you.    Wh ?! Ohmigod this is gonna be amaaazing! You\'re just doing this to spite me! And? I should be teaching Rona Thorne how to be a secret agent.  Not Lana.  "Woman\'s perspective. " I mean, I\'m so obviously the best agent, duh, how could she pick Lana over me?! The mind fairly boggles.  Exactly!   Wait, was that sarcasm?   No, sir.  Oh good.  Because your opinion matters.  And since you seem unclear on the concept, that was sarcasm.  Well played, sir.  Thank you.  Thank you.  But the minute this interferes with my real assignments, we\'re finished.  Ohmigod totally yes, I mean I\'m just acting but your work is so, so vital! Well I mean no, it is, but No! Don\'t do that, I am so, lookit me, I am so.  Inspired by you! I really? Ohmigod, you are like, the epitome of an empowered woman, and if I can bring even a tenth of your strength and sexiness to my character? Oh my God! Yer kidding.  And just exactly what is so funny? I no, it\'s just It\'s just kinda hard to picture you as a young actress For your information A young anything My acting career, shut up, was really taking off.  In fact, I was on my way to a callback for a TV commercial, doing the crossword on the 41 bus, and a man leans over and says "If you like puzzles, I may have a job for you," and guess who he was.  Wild Bill Donovan Wild Bill Donovan, head of the OSS! Three weeks later I was in Tunisia, killing a man.  But I always wondered, what if I had gotten that commercial? Guess that Tunisian guy\'d still be alive He was German, and this character, Gerald Martin, the CIA director, why couldn\'t that be Geraldine Martin? No, that\'s awful, um ooh, Malory! But not Martin, something like Steele, because she\'s a very strong woman who Who will remember that at bonus time! And she\'s also having a torrid affair with one of the sexy young agents Who\'s black.  Waaaagh! Ohmigod that is amaaazing! And that was a lot better at least that time you fired downrange.  And ohmigod seriously, I am so like, like, really super sorry about that.  Totally my fault.  Please go buy a new suit at Bergdorf\'s and send the bill to my manager.  Thanks, I will take you up on that Right after I go to the hospital.  Ohmigod if I like, possessed the capacity to be embarrassed? Eh.  I shouldn\'t have started you off with a fully auto.  Let\'s see what we have in a semi automatic Well, that\'s no good What\'s not? ARCHER Your stance, you\'re fighting yourself.  Excuse me? ARCHER You\'re all rigid and stiff.  Which I\'m all for, rimshot, but not on the range.  You have to relax, let the weapon be an extension of your body Oh my God Aw, I meant to make a frowny face But hey, speaking of your body, and my body, and stiffness What the hell, Lana?! Oh, I bet that really hurt, didn\'t it? What? Yeah ha ha ha, grown ups, keep moving your lips without making any any Maahp.  Mah mah mahp.  Maaaahp! Excuse me.  Can you believe I used to date him?   Yes.    And wait, what? And I bet he cheated on you just like I bet every one of your boyfriends has, going all the way back to Sorry, but I assume you were just an insanely gawky teenager? There was some mild gawkiness, but Which you\'ve never gotten over, which is why, please don\'t hate me, you\'re like, teeming with insecurities   Wh ? ! No I\'m not!   When you totally shouldn\'t be! You\'re gorgeous and smart and ohmigod, have you read "UnleasUnhing the Me"?! By Reinhart Schmoll?! You have to read it! Take my copy, it\'ll change your life and Oh! And you have to start keeping a journal of Hey, where\'s my journal? Umm I maybe kinda slightly took it.  Why why why, would you do that?! Didja think it was meat? I shut up I just wanted, ya know, to see what she\'s really like.  Give me that! Little Miss Invasion of the Privacy Snatchers! Oh, come on! Haven\'t you ever snooped on somebody you thought was dreamy? No! Well, except Randy Trexler, who turns out was just leading me on to get out of the draft so I made a phone call to the draft board, and now who\'s laughing, Mr.  Hooks for Hands?! A booby trap blew his arms off.  They said it was in a coconut! Mahp! Mmahp.  Mmahp.  Hi, yeah, please! Keep gawking at the deaf person! Deaf people are gross.  Not as gross as the hook hand ones.  Eh.  I dunno.  Mahp.  Maaahp.  Yeah, quit doing that? Mahp, what? Stop? Not helping? Is that helping? Frickin Lana, even for her, this is over the line.  She is gonna wish I was never born.  Just gonna softball it in like that? ARCHER Mahp, what? I\'m sorry? I said come in here, I need your help.  But I\'m on my way to a SexAnon meeting.  Which is exactly why I need you! You oh no, please Ms.  Archer, Don\'t flatter yourself! I\'m talking about this, the script for "Disavowed"! "Cut to Malory Steele, the fiftyish and incredibly sexy CIA director" spy comedy? Wh ? No! Because that has been done.  It\'s a taut, sexy thriller! Or it will be, if I can just get all the taut, sexy bits in the right order.  Yikes yeah, you can\'t have a flashback with a flash forward in it,   That\'s where you come in.    That\'s bad writing.  Because I wangled a call with the studio execs, and I think I can sell them on a rewrite, if you fix it.  Well for starters, I don\'t think you wanna say this guy is "as coal black and thick muscled as a field hand. " I don\'t need you for content, just for plot structure! But racist overtones aside, it really kinda limits your casting options.  I mean, only two, three guys could play that.  You just have to find the right guy, who\'s not intimidated by your power.  Or my twin TEC 9\'s Or those big, steam shovelly scoops you call hands.  I\'m kidding! Look, lookit me, that\'s the gawky six foot teenager everybody cheats on, not the embodiment of sexy empowered womanhood that you\'ve become! Ya really think I\'m sexy and empowered? Wh ? You\'re like a brown Boudicca! Who I wrote an amazing poem about in Damn, I wish I could find my journal! So then it\'s settled, we\'re a go on OperationWhat should we call it? Dick Sledge.  You wanna? No, but it\'s like sour milk, ya just gotta take a whiff.  What\'s the story, neckbonenes? Sophomore year at my stupid college I had a huge crush on the quarterback, this super hot guy named Dick Sledge   Sploosh.    Jinx.   but it was like I was invisible, he wouldn\'t even sign my cast when I broke my own arm.  But I thought if I knew what he liked I\'d have an in, so one Saturday when he had a game I broke into his dorm room to see what kinda music he was into, or turtles, or roll around in his clothes, or whatever, but But you were so busy sniffin his jock you didn\'t hear him come in Because he totally snuck up on me! Then I guess I blacked out because I don\'t remember stabbing him at all.  Wh ? ! Why\'d you have a knife?! I didn\'t! It was a stupid pair of scissors, and it was his fault for grabbing me with his throwing hand! That\'s how his tendon got severed! Holy shitsnacks.  Yeah, they said he could\'ve gone pro.  So, glossing over why you broke your own arm So he\'d sign my cast.  What exactly is your point? Duh.  Just break into Rona\'s apartment and put her stupid journal somewhere.  Hey yeah! Nooope! Why not? Because it\'s just not believable that this guy who, also, can not be named Cassius would risk his career for a woman twice his age! So make her forty! Yeah, and who\'s gonna play her?! Wh ? Me! That\'s the whole point! You do realize there\'s a finite supply of Vaseline in the universe! Type! Nerd.  I\'m sorry, I shouldn\'t have said that, mahp, but I\'m under a lot of stress.  Oh oh, and we\'re not?! Ya got any idea how much I got on my plate?! What, I coulda crushed that! Now c\'mon, let me help.  Whatcha got? Well, we\'re picking up chatter about a bomb threat in the Middle East Who cares?! I\'m talking local, guys! Yes, yes! See, this is Wow, singlespaced, wanna broad stroke it for me? Kolchenko, the new Soviet premier, is scheduled to give a speech at the UN in favor of strategic arms limitations talks, but the hardliners in the KGB Who am I, Kissinger?! Broad strokes! The KGB is gonna shoot this prick as he walks into the UN.    And?   And what? Was that so hard? Count Snackula? No, shut up, we go in, drop the journal, and get out.  No snooping.  Aw c\'mon, I just wanna see if me and her have any stuff in common, like Tons of cockporn laying around? I don\'t have cockporn just layin around! But sometimes, ya know, you forget it\'s in the VCR! How do you forget? Ya rub one out, flip back to regular TV, "Superstars" is on, and all of a sudden here\'s Joe Frazier\'s dumb ass drowning, and ya forget it\'s in there! Until mom and dad come to visit to tell ya she\'s got Lou Gehrig\'s disease.  Why would you think it\'s O. K.  to share that? Why are you idiots in the armory? And gimme those! Hey, we\'re using those! No you\'re not! All this equipment is for field operatives only.  Now beat it, ladies, I\'m on a mission.  You\'re not our supervisor! And, shut up, we\'re on a mission too! We\'re breaking into Rona\'s apartment to hide the stupid journal Pam stole.  You\'re kidding.    No.    Yes.  There\'s a sniper out there, whose bullet could spark World War Three, and you idiots are tying up ISIS resources on high school bullshit?!   Yes.    No.  Because I don\'t really see a downside to that, Archer wise.  Here, load up.  Should be a big box of grenades around here somewhere.  Where? ! Tell me where Pinch Two is supposed to go, and I\'ll Act Two! Act Two is wall to wall with this love story you\'re making me shoehorn into The forbidden love between Malory and Cassius is central to the plot! Oh for the Why dontcha just make it a shot for shot remake of Mandingo! Hate to interrupt, but I\'m off on a dangerous mission! That\'s what people wanna see! Not "Granny Gets Jungle Fever. " Get out! But even though it\'s super dangerous, I\'m preventing World War Three, so Wait, what?! Hm? Nothing, no big deal, excuse me.  Excuse me.    Nooope.    Ohmigod strong and sexy, amaazing! Will you shut up?! And if you don\'t mind, I have to stop KGB snipers from assassinating the Soviet premier as he enters the UN.    Now there\'s a Pinch Two!   Yeah, that\'s pretty good You\'re not taking this mission.  You never qualified as a countersniper! I would have! Ya know, if I\'d gone to the thing.  Yeah, well, if your aunt had balls she\'d be your uncle.    What?   There\'s your Pinch Two! So I\'ll just be taking these And me! Nooope! Lana, please this is perfect for my role! You have to have to have to! No, this is the real thing, Rona.  Which is why it\'s a job for a man.  Which is why shut up because I, and Rona, am and are taking the mission! Ohmigod, this is gonna be Don\'t! Say it! I swear to God! Amaaazing.  Isn\'t this amazing? Not really, no.  Actually kinda wish I\'d let Archer take this one But we\'re like, keeping the world free for democracy or whatever! Not if I can\'t take out the KGB sniper team, God knows where they are There\'s about a bajillion hide sites around here And a hidden transmitter in your rifle scope.  You dumb idiot? I\'m sorry? You should be! Look, I took this call as a courtesy to Rona, okay? Which now I\'m regretting, because what kinda facacta bullshit is this?! "Disavowed" is a spy thriller! Well, which is why we want to change the title, to To what, "Mandingo Two"?! Wait, hang on, hang on, Jeannie?! Anybody doing a "Mandingo" sequel?! When can you get me a treatment?   I, I   Two weeks.  Ya got a week, we\'re calling it "Mandingo Two, The Enslavening!" Well, Cyril? We did it.  Yeah we kinda did, didn\'t we? A taut, sexy thriller Oh yes, take me! Take me, Cassius! Ohmigod Lana, you seem really tense.  You know what I do when I\'m tense? No, but I bet you\'re gonna tell us   Kelp tape!   What? It\'s amazing, these like, kung fu monks make this fifty foot tape, like a cloth measuring tape but it\'s kelp, and you swallow it over like three days then you start to, ya know, pass it, then you just slowly slowly pull it out of you over three more days Wait, what? And it pulls all the toxins out of your body and you just feel so clean! Yeah? While you\'re tangled up in a half mile of shit covered tape? Frickin actresses.  Okay, time for a little tension relief of my own And you know what else is great, colonics Will you shut up, I gotta window opening up at dammit, there\'s another one! This is so exciiiiting! And another one, shit, and another! But that\'s not all! If you order now, you\'ll also receive No way! Yup.  He\'s down.  But not forgotten.  Come, Kreigerbots! Avenge your fallen comrade! What voice is that? Is that from ***? Dammit, they\'re everywhere! There\'s too many, I can\'t Lemme help, tell me how to help! Shut up and grab that spotter scope, and tell me where they are! Okay, there\'s a nice way to do that.  Will you just?! Okay, there\'s a, wait, no that\'s a ohmigod I can see my penthouse! Well unless there\'s a sniper in it Well somebody\'s in it!

Hey, what the shit?! Rona, stop! This is a serious ow! situation.  I know and ohmigod I am so sorry! Please please please don\'t hate me! Unghh what\'s wrong with me? It\'s tetrodoxin, from the fugu fish.  Whuh?!   Yeah, what?!   I\'m a Russian sleeper, silly! Jesus Lana, how did you not see that?! Oh, I never got to tell this.  Well, my parents were sleepers in L. A.    still are, love them   and we were encouraged to, ya know, blend, and so I ended up being an actress.  Ohmigod I know, but the lengths they go to, lookit me, you have no idea.  Is my new favorite device of ever.  I mean it, with the scnhozz and the combover yer a dead ringer for Karl Malden!

Friday night was Cornhole League, then on Saturday If I cared about what you do on the weekend, I\'d stick a shotgun in my mouth and pull the trigger with my toes.  Saturday I watched a building burn down.  Morning, Ms.  Archer! It took all weekend, but I finally got that payroll glitch sorted out.  I said by five on Friday.  Yeah sorry, the computer was down, so over the weekend I had to punch all these cards by hand, and then carefully put them in order.  Careful It\'s pretty delicate.  Wow, and this is all marzipan? Yeah, except for the barn, that\'s just graham crackers and icing.  Well, your dad is gonna love it.  I hope so.  I mean, it\'s probably not the best birthday present for a diabetic? Pam, those quarterly reports better be on my desk when I walk in there.  Are you walking in there right now? What did I tell you on Friday?! I know, and I was gonna come in this weekend, but I had to finish this so I could get it in the mail today.  Wrong answer.  What the shit?!   Hey, hey now, c\'mon honey,   It\'s just like when the farm flooded in real life! Only tiny and sweet!   Idiots.  Surrounded by nothing but   What the hell is your problem? Finding your replacement, missy, if you don\'t watch your tone! My tone? !! You watch your tone, you don\'t speak to me like I\'m some Some what?! Balloon breasted bimbo?! Always prancing around here in those clingy little whatever the hell they are, mini sweater dresses and your double D push up bras, so that all anyone can see, for miles around, are your gigantic breasts! Soyou wanna tell me what\'s going on? No, I want you to get out.    Malory? Hey.    I\'m sorry, dear.  I had a mammogram on Friday and theyfound something.  Oh my God Yeah.  Sois that why yer bein\' such a bitch?   You both have to swear you won\'t breath a word of this to anyone.    Totally.  Yes.  Especially Sterling.  If he found out that I might have breast cancer, he\'d be devastated.  So this information cannot leave this Pam, what the hell What? Nothing.    You\'re texting about my   I\'m not, I swear!   This is about   Breast cancer?! Oh, you poor thing! Pam! What is wrong with you? I can\'t help it, it\'s like a disease.  Pam! Do you not know what "disease" means?   Oh sorry, I forgot you might have   Breast cancer?! Oh for the love! And would you get off?! Breath?! Malory, if there\'s anything we can do you just say the word! My entire laboratory is at your disposal.  Thanks, I\'ll let you know if I need ahybrid pigboy.  A what? What are you I don\'t have one of those! That\'ll do, Pigley That\'ll do.    Anymore, what\'re we talking about?   Nothing.  Because no one is to speak of this, ever, and especially not to Sterling!   Good morning, dear!   Good morning.  What\'s the big, non me telling secret? Is there one? At a spy agency? There\'s no secret dear, we were just Mother.  Pardon me, sorry, one second.  Pam? No, you don\'t Pam!   Pam.    Pam! Pam.  I\'m okay I\'m okay, I\'m good! I\'m good   Pam.    Your mom\'s got breast cancer! She what? !? Damn her piggy little eyes!   Aww, Pigley   Mother?! Is this Do you? Ugh Oh, good God.  You\'d think he was a half fainting goat.  Oh, Goatley.  Well, actually men can develop breast cancer although it\'s extremely rare.  Yeah.  And also hereditary.  So, thank you mother for that.  Oh, there\'s a good chance your mother\'s first mammogram was a false positive.  I\'ll know for sure after I get the results of her diagnostic exam, but I\'ve got a good feeling about her.  And the feeling is mutual, doctor.  Hey, can you notright now There\'s several other risk factors for male breast cancer, such as any history of alcoholism.    You know, I mean I drink socially, but   Hah! I didn\'t have breakfast.  Any unusual exposure to radiation Um Wait, seriously don\'t open it?   Yeah.    Oh, I thought you were being sarcastic.  Looking for this? Or perhaps the lead container I probably should\'ve left it in? So wait, wait, wait, wait.  There\'s good cholesterol? Mmmnope.  Well, then a little dose won\'t hurt.  Doctor, I have Ms.  Archer\'s results Well if it isn\'t Chet Manley! Yeah, and is it I wanna say Peggy? Rita! And you said you\'d call me! Really? To both statements? Hello?! If it\'s not too much trouble I\'d like to know if I have cancer! The first test was a false positive.  You\'re totally fine.  Wh ? Oh thank God! Yeah good.  Hey, wanna grab a drink later? Peggy? I can\'t believe it, it\'s such a relief! I don\'t have breast cancer! So, guess we can skip all this, huh? Well we\'re here, machine\'s on, may as well take a look.  So, if you could?   Hm? Oh, sorry   Wow.  Wow what, what is wow, what is that? Thaaat Yeah that\'s breast cancer.    What?!   What?! Yeah.  So listen Wanna grab a drink later? Yep.  Stage Two breast cancer Yeah, I mean it\'s not as bad as Stage Three or Four, but it\'s not, ya know, obviously not as good as no cancer.  God, I should definitely get checked.  I\'m so bad about doing the self exam.  Hey, how about we check each other?!   So what\'s next, do you do chemo, or   A lumpectomy.  I go in for surgery next week, and they\'ll try to cut it all out If they can\'t get it all, or if it spreads to my lymph nodes, then they\'ll do chemo, but I\'m trying to stay positive, cause I can beat this.  Wow, you seem kinda different.  Yeah, did I mention I have cancer? Not that, dick, your whole outlook.  All this positivity and whatever.  I have to be positive.  Gotta stay strong.  So here, show some support.  Here, Brett, take a ribbon.    What is this?   Pink ribbon.  I have breast cancer.  Ha ha! Seriously? Breast cancer?   Yes   Sure it\'s not lady vagina cancer? Excuse me.  I\'m trying! To stay positive! Both mentally! And spiritually! Brett! Well he certainly doesn\'t have cancer in his fists.  He\'s beating his ass.  Now, if you all will excuse me again, I\'m going to spend some quality time with those who are dear to me.  Brett.  Yeah hey it\'s got a safety pin! What?! Breast cancer, and yes, seriously.  And I dunno how it\'s gonna turn out, so I wanted to, ya know spend some time with the wee baby Seamus.  He\'s not even yer real kid.    So?   So it\'s weird.  So is me paying you child support, Trinette, but you keep cashing the checks! I\'m sorry.  C\'mon Trinette, Seamus may not be my son, but he\'s probably as close as I\'m ever gonna get.  Where\'re you taking him? I dunno what\'s he into? Oh, that is just classic him I mean my God, I was the one who Was getting all the attention? Who thought I had breast cancer.  Shut up! And now he has it and it\'s all Sterling this and ribbons that!   Well he does actually have cancer   Well he didn\'t get it from me! CHERYL/CAROL Wh ?! It\'s contagious?! What the shit?! I know, I\'m not normally a tattoo guy, but Not yours, shitbrain! His! Yeah it\'s like, we\'ve got each other\'s backs.  Right? You can\'t tattoo a frickin baby! That\'s what the tattoo guy said.  Had to slip him an extra hundred bucks.  How bout I slip somebody a hundred bucks to throw acid in your face?! Costs more than that, I bet to buy acid, Trinette.  C\'mon, Seamus!   I hope your stupid cancer kills you.    Oh yeah?! Well I hope it doesn\'t! And to that end Woodhouse, macrobiotic food.  Find out what that is and start cooking it.  Oh, and smoothies, and and why are you dressed like a tout? My vacation starts today, sir.  What?! I\'m riddled with cancer and you wanna take a vacation?! No, but I asked for the time off a year ago, and Dicky and I\'ve been planning this trip ever since, and Who\'s Dicky?   My brother.    What? He\'s younger.  Obviously.

Oh, well   I\'m serious, you know, you showed me how important family is and you\'re kind of family and I know I\'m not always as nice to you as I could be, so I\'m gonna work on that, okay? Yessir.

Oh, you can use one of my old ones.    I don\'t want to use it.  You\'re Chett Manly now.  How about that?   I don\'t wanna be Chett Manly.    Everybody! Say hello to my friend, Chett Manly.

Well, you are just gonna kill me But turns out I was right the first time.  The first time, you said I was cured! Wait, now I\'m confused.  At the hospital!   You said   Oh! No, I mean the first phone call.  When I said the cancer had spread to your lymph nodes.  So yeah, we\'re gonna wanna to start a round of chemo ASAP, but in the meantime is your mother there? Are you here? Eh.  What? Too soon?So there\'s your breast cancer tumor, and the portacath, through which you take cyclophosphamate intravenously Sim.  And you\'re taking tetraphenol orally? E tambm portugus.  Em CD ROM.  Boa sorte! Obrigado.  And I dunno Krieger, maybe it\'s because I\'m just a badass, but chemotherapy is kind of a breeze.  Yeah, that\'s my point.  Two weeks of chemo with no hair loss, and you\'re not experiencing   any nausea?   No, gracias a dubi mediciano.  Which, I gotta tell ya: huge fan.  Yeah? Yeah, and I advocate its use.  As a potential role model, I advocate it.  To combat chemotherapy related nausea, or for cannabidiol\'s clinically proven ability to inhibit cancer cell growth? It does that? Yep, and if you need more lemme know.  I got a guy.  Me too.  He\'s called a pharmacist.  Yeah, and is he the same pharmacist who gave you all these chemo drugs? Well he damn sure didn\'t give it to me.  You would not believe how much cancer medicine costs Those pills are like eighty bucks each, and the IV stuff is literally two grand a bag, so why the hell are you poking a hole in my bag Krieger?! Because I want to run a few tests.    And so, if the reagent turns blue   What does that mean, is that good? No.  It means this eighty dollar pill is one hundred percent sucrose.    What?   Sugar? I know what sucrose is, idiot! But there\'s medicine in there too, right?! Ummm, no.  Not a trace.  Wh ?! So I\'ve been treating my breast cancer with sugar pills?! Yeah, you didn\'t think it was weird your chemo drugs were chewable? No! Little kids get cancer! Aww they do.  What about the intravenous drug?! Right, yes, the cyclophosphamate.    Mmmm   "Mmmm" what?! "Mmmm" no, this isn\'t cyclophosphamate.  Well what the Krieger! What the hell is it?! Well, this is just an educated guess, but Zima? Oh my God, are you serious? Counterfeit cancer drugs?! Yeah, basically candy corn and Zima.    Jesus   Which, probably why I\'ve been in such a great mood, but But Sterling, your tumor! All this time, it\'s been? Growing, I guess.    Oh, Sterling   Plus God knows how many other cancer patients have been taking that stuff.    Like Ruth   Here you go, folks.  A week\'s supply of breast cancer chemotherapy drugs, and of course, your medical marijuana.  Oh, you poor thing.  Does someone you love have breast cancer? Yeah.  Me.    I\'m uh, name\'s Archer.    Ruth.  And don\'t you worry, dear.  We can beat cancer with this medicine.  Even if I can barely pay for it.  Don\'t you worry, Ruth I\'m gonna make them pay for it.  What\'re you Sterling no, you\'re not well! What are you going to do? Cry havoc, and let slip the hogs of war.  Dogs of war.  Whatever farm animal of war, Lana, shut up.  I think he gets it.  Just film the confessions, Lana, don\'t editorialize.  Do you get it?   Yes! Look, please   Because I swear to God I will strip back down and show you all over again.  I get it! I get it! You have a lot of guns! And a knife.  Which I am going to push, very slowly, into your urethra Ew.  ARCHER: if you don\'t answer my questions.  Number one Wow.  What a pussy.  I could barely even keep up, he was spilling the beans so fast.  Well, you threatened to shove a knife up his dick hole.  Which again, ick.  Well excuse me, Lana, it\'s a rampage.  Still though.  You really wanna take on the Irish mob? No, I don\'t.  But they\'re the ones switching out life saving cancer drugs with candy and Zima! And why couldn\'t it be the Brazilian mob? Estou aprendendo portugus.  Plus I can only assume a Brazilian mob would be a jillion times sexier.  Seriously, these potato heads have to be the unsexiest mob of all time.  You know who yer messin with, boyo?! You ve any idea who our boss is?! Nope, but 100 people surveyed number 1 answered I\'m the board.  Name the douchebag, who\'s in charge.  Vincent.  Van Go[BEEP]yerself.  Vincent Van Go[BEEP]myself.  Survey says!   Jesus, Archer!   What, Lana?! I said it was a rampage! Still though! Rrrngh! Oh, you son of a hoor! Save it for the Fast Money round.  Hundred people surveyed, number one answer\'s still on the board.  Name the douchebag, who\'s in charge.  Gonk gonk.  Need an answer.  Cock flavored spit.  Well, you never know what\'s going to be on the board.  Let me see cock flavored spit.  Guys, that\'s two strikes! One more and the innocent Honduran janitors get a chce to steal the bank! I\'m just assuming you guys don\'t know what actually goes on here.  Hope that doesn\'t sound racist.    Okay, kid   He is a kid, Archer, so Lana! You\'re in the isolation booth!   Looking for the douchebag, who\'s in   Mikey Hannity, You say one word and I\'ll cut yer yella heart out myself Oh! Christ! Mikey, listen to me.  I have breast cancer.  Ha! Breast cancer.  So you\'ll forgive my impatience because I and a lot of other people I\'ve been trying to fight cancer   with your bosses fake chemo drugs.    Chemo? They just told me it was cream for male pattern baldness.  Do I look like I need bald guy cream? No, but I Luckily, I can barely get a comb through this.  It\'s so thick my barber charges me double.  I love my hair.    As I am sure you love your kneecap.    Franny Delaney.  He rules everything out here and Brooklyn.  Numbers, protection, dope, prostitution.  Victimless crimes, Mickey.  Tell me about the counterfeit chemo drugs.  They make the pharmacist buy the real stuff.  Delaney says I swear I don\'t know who, but they switch it with the fake stuff here.  And those pricks do all the packing.  What? You guys are in on this? And I was worried about sounding racist.    Were you?   They don\'t even know what goes on here.  They can\'t even read English.  What all those dirty beaners care about is   taking American jobs.    Well, relax, Kennedy.  It wasn\'t all that long ago that everybody hated the Irish.  For swarming over here in their potato boats and taking all the jobs.  Yeah, they Wait, what? And I\'m pretty sure and guys feel free to correct me that beaner is a pejorative term for a Mexican, Esta correto ou nao? Huh Had to be a little more overlap with the Portuguese.  Well, plus they\'re gagged.  Still, though And third, is this the real stuff? Yeah, this is all real.  Why? Because I\'m way behind on my treatment.  Wait, Archer, what are you doing? I\'m sorry, did I mention I have cancer? I know, but now? In mid rampage? You really think that\'s a good idea? To take my prescribed chemotherapy for my said aforementioned cancer?! Yes, idiot! I do! I\'m sorry I called you an idiot.  Yeah? Yeah, you were totally right.  Not a smart mid rampage move.  Wh ?! And you think that is?! Yes, idiot! I do! Sorry.  Again.  I\'m not myself.  But you are kinda being a bitch.  Okay so, day two of the chemo fueled rampage and, wow, how ya holdin up? Not great.  Uh, I\'ve got wine coolers on my feet, because my toenails are popping off like pogs, uh, fair amount of gastric distress, and ummscarf.  Yeah well, suck it up.  I tracked Delaney to an all night poker game.  Great, one second? I never thought I\'d say this, but I really miss the Zima.  I mean was I there for every single recital and lacrosse game? No.  Is our adult relationship perfect? No.  But I I just can\'t even imagine life without my precious Sterling.  Have you ever told him that? What, are you kidding? No.  Wow, really? My mom told me how much she loved me all the time.  Exactly.  Look how you turned out.  Um with high self esteem? Whatcha doin, Krieger? Well I feel bad for Archer, so I\'m making him some Portuguese flashcards.  Portuguese? But isn\'t I thought Krieger was a German name.  Oh, ber German.  It means "warrior. " So how come you know Portuguese? Because I grew up in Braz istol County, Rhode Island? Lotta Portuguese in Rhode Island.  Where you\'re from.  Born and raised! Uh huh.  What\'s the state capital? Of? Rhode Island.    Dallas?   Aha! What? It\'s Austin, duh! It\'s Providence! But I bet he knows the capital of Brazil! Don\'t you?! I don\'t have to answer that! Who do Weiter den Kampf der mein Fhrer! Scheisse.    Oh my God   What the heck was that all about? Duh! I actually have no idea.  No shit.  Yeah, I don\'t know why I do that.  Because I don\'t want it in my car! Well what do you want me to do, Lana, just throw it out the window?!   Obviously!   Oh.  Ha ha.  Uh oh.  Gonna be sick again.  Not in here you\'re not.    Then pull over, Lana.    No, we\'re late.  You already missed your shot at Delaney as it is.  Well then now this is happening.  Wh ? Lana, did you see my scarf? Yes, Archer, I saw your scarf.    All my hair fell out.    I\'m sorry.  Me too.  It was my fifth best feature.    Oh, I think it\'s your sweetness   Nobody\'s ever called me sweet before.  Well, you\'re sweet enough to come see a sick old lady in the hospital.  What? I didn\'t come by to see you, I\'m trying to bang a candy striper.  But, um it\'s not good, huh? No, dear.  Afraid it\'s just not responding to those chemo drugs.  You two can\'t smoke in here! Oh, unwad your panties.  Yeah! Archer!   What?!   We\'re here.  Oh.  Right.  You good? Rampaaaaaaaaage! Little help? Leave me alone! I\'m not a Nazi! Yeah, well what about your father?! No, he was a scientist! Pretty sure the Nazis had scientists.  No they didn\'t! That\'s why we They lost the war! Lack of science! Well, we\'ll just see what Ms.  Archer has to say about this Nazi beeswax.  Fine! Or, you know not fine.  Because between the cancer and the chemo and the just   shit tons of weed   Actually yeah, good idea, let\'s hang back a sec and burn one down.

Don\'t worry about what I\'m doing, concentrate on what you\'re doing.  W what am I doin? For starters you can apologize to my friend for your homophobic remarks.  I I\'m sorry, darlin! I had no idea you were a gay! What? She\'s not gay, she just has big hands.    What?   Nothing, shut up.  I\'m gonna assume you know the difference between an M 26 and   a Mark Two fragmentation grenade, so   What?!   What?   Oh sorry, do you not? Okay, the Mark Two has kinda nubbly ridges? Ya feel those? Different circumstances, might actually feel pretty good.  W wait, son, now just wait a second Another key difference is the pin.    Oh, Jaysus   See? The striking lever\'s the same, though.  Spring loaded.  Which reminds me: did you know that men can also benefit from doing Kegel exercises? Case in point, huh? Now where\'s your cancer patient killing boss? Okay I got it, let\'s go.  Wait, you\'re just gonna leave him with a grenade stuck up his ass?! Yes, Lana, I am on a rampage! And also kidding, it\'s a smoke grenade.  Oh, thank   Asshole.    What? What? What? What.  Lana.  What?! I thought it was a smoke grenade.  They look exactly nothing alike! What? What\'re you doing, Delaney\'s not here.  No, but my ENT doctor is.  You like him? Because I sure do.  Good bedside manner, knows all the parts of the ear.    What was his name again?   Mr.  Archer? I guess you heard about Ruth.    What?   About Ruth.  I guess you heard.    What?!   Ruth! Your friend! Is dead! W what? Regis.  I wake up early every morning and watch Regis.  And that smile of his well, it gets me through the day.  I\'m gonna start doing that.  Oh, you must.    Regis is the best.    No, Ruthyou\'re the best.    Archer.    Hm?   Archer!   What? ! Oh.  Man, what\'ve I been doing? Chain smoking joints the size of tampons.    Ew.    Figure of speech.  Still though.  Ew.  LANA You\'re not rampaging? I thought you were rampaging.  Right yes, here we go.  Alright.  I got this. ! Franny Delaney! Let\'s take a walk! A walk? Is that some sorta joke? A roll, then.  Whatever.  Are you not listening to me?! Well obviously not.  My God, how is there not one picture of us together? Krieger\'s father was a Nazi scientist! And JFK\'s father was a bootlegger.  CYRIL Wh ? That\'s like comparing apples to Nazi oranges! Oranges, exactly.  Do you like powdered orange breakfast drink?   No, not really.    How about micro wave ovens, Neil Armstrong, hook and loop fasteners?   Okay, you lost me.    None of those things would be possible without the Nazi scientists we brought back after World War II.    The Nazis invented Neil Armstrong?   Rockets, which put him on the moon.  After the war ended we were snatching up Kraut scientists like hot cakes.  You don\'t believe me? Walk into NASA sometime and yell "Heil Hitler!".  They all jump straight up.  But, Cyril I know all about Dr.  Krieger\'s origins.  And I also know that nobody likes a tattle tale.    Yes, Cyril.    And if it\'s one thing I\'ve learned in all my years as a spy master is that you keep your friends   close.    Yeah, Cyril.  And possible genetic clones of Adolf Hitler   closer.    Yeah, Cyril.    Wait, what?   Yeah, what? Oh, my God, it was you.  My 15th birthday You You were at the compound.  When they finish, bring me the boy.  The day my pet dobermans accidentally ate my father.    My father   Oh, Krieger Nothing\'s an accident.  Holy shitsnacks! Krieger\'s one of the boys from Brazil! Duh! Oh my God, seriously, I\'m sorry.  I think I need help or something.  No shit.  And one more crack about "monster hands" and I promise you that I will shoot your fat Irish faces off I\'m sorry, was that racist? I\'m not mad at you, I\'m sorry, I\'m mad at Archer.  Thanks to him I\'ve got two perforated eardrums, and I guess I\'ve just been Getting hotboxed all day in my car! Shit, which I\'m trying to sell, but fat chance now! Bet it smells like weed and rampage Damn it, that is classic him! You guys have any snacks? Here.  This is good, right here.  For what, boyo? We havin a picnic? Oh my God do you have snacks? No.  What I have, is a plane to catch.  Yeah? To where? Some bigger mansion somewhere else you bought with the profits from your fake chemo drugs? Pretty much, yeah.    So if you\'re gonna shoot me   Oh don\'t worry, I\'m gonna shoot you.  No yer not.  You\'re an ISIS agent.  Ya got a sense of honor, fair play.  What? You obviously haven\'t seen my movie "Terms of Emrampagement,"   hang on that was lame   Ya killed my men, sure, but they were armed.  I\'m just a sick old man in a wheelchair.    You can\'t do it, boy.  I know you.    You don\'t know me! I know you better than yer muther Who I had for three days, at Dc Quay.  Can you, um, go ahead and repeat that? I said I had your mother for three days at Dc Quay.  And was that uh, hopefully, some sort of Vietcong prison camp? Single\'s resort.  Phuket, Thailand.  Whole place ran on beads.  But lemme tell ya boyo, that muther o\' yers found a whole new way to use \'em! To use the beads? Oh yeah.  Boop! And then zzzzzziiiinnnng! Like an SSP racer.  Good times.  Goodbye, Archer.  Tell yer muther to gimme a call sometime.  Delaney? Yes? Did you see Regis this morning? Yes.  Why? Yes.  Why?   Oh for the love of   Shut up! Shut up, here it comes! Booyakashaaaaa! Right in the face! I swear to God, I could watch this a million times.  I\'d swear to God we already have.  Well too bad, mother.  Booyakashaaa! Booyakashaaa! Hey just because he was your boyfriend What, "boyfriend"?! It was two weeks in Phuket, anything goes over there.  Zzzzzziiiinnnng! Ahem.  Wildly inappropriate.  Seriously, Pam.  Okay, Clone Wars.  Zing.  And Mother, we had a deal.  I supply the mimosas and bagels and lox, and you people shut up and ingest them and watch "Terms of Emrampagement. "   Ugh   Which, obviously, working title.  We have watched it! Every Friday for the past three months!   I\'m not complainin   See? Twelve straight weeks and Pam\'s still on Team Live Badass.  Yeah, and Team Live Badass? That\'s the best you could come up with? Well, Lana, since you already had dibs on   Team I Have An Oversized Vagina   Hey shut up! You shut up! And everybody else shut up and watch "Terms of Emrampagement!" Why don\'t you call it "Magnum P. U. "? It\'s a working title! Idiots! Liked him better when he had cancer First of all, what the shit? ! Mother! And second of all too bad, because the doctor says my cancer is in total remission.  Seriously, what is cancer? So I\'ll probably never get any sort of cancer again, ever.  So shut up and watch my movie.  For which I really need a better title.  How about "Citizen Dickbag"? "Snark Victory"? Wait, I got it! Casablampkin.So then he\'s all like "Ya gotta go before my roommate gets home" and I\'m like "Who cares?" and he\'s like You\'re a moped.  How do you know? What\'s it mean anyway? Mopeds are fun, but you don\'t want your buddies to see you riding one.    Ohhh   Yeah.  I thought he meant I was fuel efficient.  I only had ten beers.    Fourties?   No! Yes.  Hence the shandy.  My head feels like a bunch of monkies fighting over a bucket of marbles.  Stick that horn in your ass! Nutsack.  And what time is it?   Well it\'s 9:01, but   And what time is late? Technically 9:01, also, but I\'m sure Cheryl has a good excuse this time.  Oh right, like the time her ocelot was sick! Or yesterday, when she said she had to walk to work because there was a midget on the train!   I think she said it was a dwarf   And I said that was her last chance! She\'s fired.  I want her desk cleaned out and a new secretary by lunch.    That\'s kinda more Pam\'s department   Who is also late! And I just can\'t wait to hear that lame excuse Just get her in the damn van! She\'s crazy frickin strong! Yeah! You fight \'em off, Cheryl! Wh ? ! Cheryl?! Yes! That\'s you! You\'re Cheryl! What? ! What\'re you Aaaghh! I swear to God I\'m blind! C\'mon, the boss is waiting! We don\'t need her! Because I\'m just her stupid friend! She\'s who you want! Cheryyyyl! Yes, just keep shouting your own name! What\'re you I\'ll pray for you, Cheryl! Goddammit, I\'m not Whew! Well that was a close one.  Ugh.  And thank Pam.  Way to drag out a kidnapping.  Now I\'m late again.  Although this is a way better excuse than the train dwarf.  Which ick.  Kidnapped.  Like a huge, sweatery Lindbergh baby.  So it\'s really Pam\'s fault I\'m late.    Why would anyone   In the world  want to kidnap Pam? There\'s a teeny tiny chance they maybe might\'ve thought Pam was me?   How?   No idea.    Well, even if you weren\'t lying   The train dwarf was real and he looked right at me with his dwarfy eyeballs! Why would anyone want to kidnap you? Because my last name isn\'t Gimple, like it says on my W 4.    It\'s Tunt.    Tum again?   Oh c\'mon, nothing?   Not the Tunts.  Wait, how do I know that name? Ever been on a railroad?   Yes.    Ho lee shit! Not a big deal, they\'re everywhere.  Yeah, and her great grandfather built \'em all! Wait, what? Do you expect me to believe you\'re a descendant of Cornelius Tunt? Yeah all, whatever, five Cornelia.  MALORY And George Washington Tunt, The Tuntmore House.  Yes.  I spent like, every summer there, listening to my creepy great grandmother bitch about Abraham Lincoln.  Apparently slavery was pretty awesome.  Prove it.  What\'s to prove, it\'s free labor.  Not that! Ass! Prove you\'re really a Tunt.    CHERYL/CAROL Umm, I have a picture   You\'re kidding.  Oh my god! That\'s you! Yes, it\'s me.  Do you guys I\'m kinda freaking out, you mind if I glue up?   It\'s your house.    This is your house! And right next door, is that that\'s the Roosevelt mansion! CHERYL/CAROL Total shitbox, they\'re weird.    What the?   What the hell was that? Ugh, my stupid ocelot.  I\'ve never seen an ocelot! Cheryl dear I don\'t know quite how to put this, but Holy shit! You guys! Look at his little spots.  How much are you, ahem, worth? Well until Monday it was liiike, I dunno, about fifty million? Do what huh what? Carol, what\'s his name?   Babou!   I love him.  But it should be Buyer\'s Remorse! Stupid thing\'s sick all the time.  What happened Monday? Oh.  My parents were murdered.  What?! I\'m kidding! They are dead, though.  The chauffeur had a stroke and slammed into a tree.  Funeral\'s probably just wrapping up.  Why aren\'t you there?! Because you said if I was late again you\'d fire me!   Not for your parents\' funeral!   Well!   I don\'t know all your rules   Can I jump in? Just kinda curious, why do you even work at ISIS? Why do you? I because I\'m not worth a billion dollars! Yeah, me neither.  I have to split it with my stupid brother Cecil.  And how much will you be splitting? It actually is a billion dollars.  I am literally wet with jealousy.  Jealous of what? Being scared of kidnappers the rest of my life?! It was bad enough when I was only worth fifty million! Now it\'s gonna be ten times worse and And oh my God, I\'m such a chicken! I told them Pam was me!   Wow.    Lana shut up.    First of all, I\'m sure Pam is fine   Who taught ya how to punch? Yer husband? You better just [BLEEP] kill me.  And second of all, no one is going to kidnap you on my watch.  You may consider ISIS your personal bodyguard.  For, you know a modest retainer.    Ah.    Still shut up.  But oh my God, what about Pam?! I dunno about Pam And I know even less about ocelots.  But my gut tells me you gotta get some tree branches or a tire swing or something in there, because he is desperate for stuff to play with.  What\'re we doing? We\'re taking Cheryl back to ISIS and locking it down until we catch those dastardly kidnappers.  Because we\'re all she has now.  Okay, but on the way we gotta stop at a toy store and at least get him a stuffed animal.  Something.  It\'s like Meow schwitz in there.  Hm hmm.  Half a billion?! With a B?! Followed by an illion.  Well that little she owes me thirtyseven hundred dollars! For what? What, nothing, what\'re we doing? Locking down ISIS.  Because once the kidnappers realize they\'ve got the wrong idiot, they\'ll probably come back for the right one.  So here.  All hands on deck.  Cool.  Safety\'s off, Barn.  Trust me, dear.  This vault is the safest place in the entire building.  But wait how much are you gonna charge for ISIS to protect me? Well that\'s based on my expenses.  Plus an administrative fee, a small contingency fee, few odds and ends And you\'re gonna get Pam back, right? Right after you sign that contract.  Okaaaaayno.  First get Pam back.    Wh ? But   And bring me some stuff to do, it\'s crazy stupid boring in here.  Well, now you know how Babou feels.  Crepuscular? God! Damn it, Cyril! Sorry!   Aw, c\'mon   Barney.  Well now this is just a disaster.  Yeah ya think?! Not you, Mr.  Blood Mobile! Cheryl is insisting we try to get the kidnappers to release Pam! Weren\'t you gonna do that anyway? If it came up! And will somebody answer the damn phone once in their life?! Lookin your way, Brett.    Hello?   Was that so hard? Yes? Yeah, one sec? Kidnappers.  Wh ? Keep \'em on the line!   I\'m lead negotiator!   No you\'re not! And you.  Take Cheryl some crayons, or cheese or something.    Unghh I\'m s so c coold   Brett get off the phone!   You got it?   Yes! Hang up! How long do I need to keep him on?   Two minutes.    What?! What happened to thirty seconds?! Your mother\'s budget priorities! No, this is all one solid piece.  Brazilian rosewood, straight from the heart of the Amazon jungle.  Guess how many pygmies died cutting it down.  Hint, six.  Small price to pay for beauty.  Hi, Sterling Archer, lead negotiator.  And to whom might I be speaking? Your worst nightmare.  Hi great, one sec? What are you doing?! I\'ll tell ya what I\'m not doing, is negotiating with a goddamn cyborg! That\'s just a voice modulator! You don\'t think cyborgs have that technology?!   I\'m hanging up!   Hanging up?! Lana, it\'s not worth it, it\'s just Pam! No, Archer, stop.  They\'re probably tracing us.  We don\'t want them coming here.  You idiots.    This is Cheryl Tunt!   That\'s what I\'ve been trying to tell you between this little girl\'s love taps.  Seriously, maybe see if your daddy will give you a roll of nickels? First of all, how are you still conscious?! How do ya think I paid for college? Two sixty, two eighty, and jackson makes three.  And sorry about your homey.  Homeys.  And second, where is Cheryl Tunt?! Well I just assume she\'s safe at ISIS, laughing her skinny lying ass off because she got me kidnapped.  This isn\'t funny Cheryl, I need that thirty seven hundred dollars back! Well, sorry.  That money\'s gone.  Wh ? What do you mean it\'s gone? It\'s been an extremely volatile year.    In the stock market?   Sure.  Well, whatever, I borrowed it from my IRA and if I don\'t pay it back What\'re they gonna do, kneecap you?! Wh ? Not the IRA, my IRA! And there are huge tax implications for that! I don\'t have it, dum dum! All my money\'s in like, a trust or whatever, and I\'d have to ask my gross brother!   So?!   So he\'s gross.  Cheryl I need that money.  I don\'t have it! Now screw already.  I\'ve got kidnappers to worry about.  But Okay, here we go This is Agent Lana Kane.  And you are? About five seconds away from shooting your friend Pam in her rock like face.    Well, we obviously don\'t want you to   Violate the First Law of Robotics.   Shoot Pam, so what will it take for you to release her unharmed? I\'ll trade you.  For Cheryl Tunt.  Tum again? Still nothing? Nooo no no no no First of all, we don\'t even know if Pam is still alive Yeah, I\'m right here with the guy!   And even if she were   I am! That\'s a no brainer! I mean my God, Cheryl\'s worth half a billion.  What?! Well?! How much is this one worth?!   Oh, for seriously?   I\'m thinking! You\'re stalling! So you can trace the call! No you\'ve got tons of time.  Oh shut up.  Hey! What\'s it gonna be?   Malory!   Alright, I can do   What?!   Okay, we\'re done here.  No no wait wait wait, don\'t hang   Five thousand?   For Pam? I bet you spent ten tis that on your new conference table! I did not! Unless you include the funeral expenses for those pygmies.  And I bet that sneaky little chief just dumped them all into one medium sized hole.  Well I was able to trace the call to a one block radius, so if you will excuse me, I am going to rescue Pam.    No, I will do that.    No, I will.  God damn it! Let\'s just everybody go! No! There\'s half a billion dollars worth of Tunt sitting in that vault! That\'s the critical mission here! So who gets it? No heroics, you two.  It\'s just Pam.  I mean, I know it\'s hard to put a dollar value on a human life, but for shit\'s sake five grand? Yeah, so please don\'t take this the wrong way, but I am gonna kill you.  Aw c\'mon, I haven\'t seen your faces!   There.    Damn.  Now shut up.  Hey so, I\'m not totally on board with a full frontal assault on ISIS.  Yeah I\'m actually totally off board.    My eyes still hurt pretty bad.    Too bad.  That\'s the only way we\'re gonna get to Cheryl Tunt.    I can get you guys in.    Um   Seriously?   Yeah, screw them.  Especially Cheryl.  Hope you kidnap a shit out of her.  Huh! Where the hell is she?   You\'re gonna be in so much trouble   No Trouble is what the IRS will do to me if I don\'t pay back that loan.  The IRS? Jesus, how many Irish gangs are there? But she must still be in the building! All the blast doors are down! Yeah, so oh, dammit! Archer and Ray had to leave through the garage! But they\'re not dumb enough to leave the door wide open! Are they?   Yes!   Why?! Because you\'re just wearing it to piss me off! Is it working? Yes! So take it off! We look totally gay!   I am gay.    Well I\'m not! Then why are you wearing that turtleneck? Take it off.  You better put that back in your purse.  Hang on, this is far from over.  Talk to me.  Yeah, it\'s totally wide open.  What? No, I\'m not an idiot, Mother! We\'re still here, in the garage! Because Ray is being a total bitch! Why do you care what he\'s wearing?!   Oh my God   I\'m not taking his side!   Oh my God   Sterling, they\'ve taken Cheryl! Probably right past you two while you were arguing over who\'s prettiest! They didn\'t come through here!   Kidnappers got Cheryl.    Dukes! But wait, they\'ve still gotta be in the building, right? Probably! So secure the perimeter, do a floor by floor sweep, and Brett! For the love of God! Hello? Yeah one sec? Kidnappers, line one.  That\'s them.  Secure and sweep.  Idiots.  Lana, follow me.  Roger that.  I will definitely tell him.    Tell me what?   She said for you take it off.  No she didn\'t! She absolutely certainly did Ray.  And also for us to sweep the building.  The doing of which I am in charge.  Hey, thanks for getting us inside.  Somebody shoot her.  Oh, okay! Then good luck getting past all the biometric scanners! I mean, unless you wanna chop off my fingertips and slice out my retinas! Oh don\'t be dicks.  What? I said, I\'ll kill the Tunt woman if you don\'t pay the ransom.  I can\'t understand a word of this.  Hey, Trainspotting.  Can you dial that modulator down a skoosh? Is that better? Barely Hang on a second how about now.  That\'s better.  Now I believe there was some mention of a ransom? Three thousand seven hundred dollars.    Wh ?   Wait, how much?! A million dollars.  Fifty million dollars.  Why the hell are you down here?! Because Cyril kidnapped me, duh! Oh you are full of shit.  You heard me.  Fifty million dollars.    Unmarked bills, uh, non sequential   Just keep him on the line.  Something\'s very fishy about this kidnapper.    Uh, let\'s see, what else   Tom Collins, try not to drown it.

Yeah, help yourself.    Well, it sure better be worth four   million bucks, which is where?   Oh, Sterling has it.    What?   You turned Archer loose in a casino   with four million dollars?   Oh, don\'t worry.  He may be a vain, selfish, lying, and quite possibly alcoholic man whore, but gambling is one vice Sterling doesn\'t have.  Guess he\'s too busy doing all that other awesome stuff.  Thanks, Mother.  Oh shut Why isn\'t there a metal briefcase full of bearer bonds   handcuffed to your drinking arm?   Uh, pretty sure you just answered   your own question   Sterling, if you left that briefcase in some cathouse, I swear to God Relax! The money\'s totally safe, on deposit with the casino.

Because they expect you to gamble! Which I\'m not going to do, duh!   Mother, I\'ve done this tons of times.    Wh With ISIS money? No.  But four million seems pretty steep for   What\'s on that disk, anyway?   None of your beeswax.  And the price is irrelevant, because you\'re going to stealea it back after the exchange.    Oh.    Duh.  And you have to steal it back because I, um, slightly borrowed it.  Umm, slightly from where? What in the world Oh no, oh no no no no no Paaaaaaaaaaaaam! Also irrelevant.

And now all the candy is Mother\'s Cause crybaby hit on seventeen again.  Like an idiot.  Why was I dressed as Hitler? Why do you do anything you do? Archer, when your mother finds out No! Ray, you can\'t tell her! Or Lana! They\'ll   think less of me.    And I won\'t?   I don\'t care what you think.    I\'m telling your mother.    Telling her what?   Your son Shhh, no.  Come on.  Is drunk.  Who\'re you, Carrie Nation? But my God, Sterling look at your clothes! Just how drunk are you?   Oh for the   We\'re meeting Lachouffe in two hours! I\'ll clean him up, try to get some coffee in him.  Make sure that\'s all you put in him! Im sorry, what? Keep it in your pants, sister.  Yeah, yuk it up Wow, all these years, I\'ve never seen Archer like, drunk drunk.    Have you?   Once.  Can\'t play cards, can\'t drink   I don\'t feel good.    What the hell good are ya?   Oh God.    Why was he dressed as Hitler? Anyhoo.  Ooh, I think I see a duke!   Ugh, what.    Nice Glad you can still be snotty, while Archer\'s gambling away your   401K!   My what?   Tell her I said hey!   Shut up, and ours too! Everybody\'s! Archer wasn\'t gambling, he was just drunk Lana, did you hear me?   Cet imbcile, il jouait ?   I thought you spoke French.  Jusqu\'il a perdu trois millions.    Oh.  Shit.    Cyril tell her I said Idiot! Stupid stupid stupid idiot! I look, I said I was sorry!   No you didn\'t!   Well? Whatever, I have a plan to get the money back which doesn\'t include you taking my hotel toiletries!   You\'re not using \'em.    Yes I am! Go look at your pores and then tell me your using \'em.  And then tell me your little genius plan.    Rob the casino.    Thanks for the lotion.  Ray, we can do this! C\'mon, I\'ve broken into way tougher places! I mean, not without my turtleneck, but still Do you even know where the bearer bonds are? Well no, not exactly, but What\'s it say on the receipt?   That you didn\'t get, did you?   No.  You know why they\'re called bearer bonds?   Because your gay.    Because they\'re unregistered and untraceable, and the legal owner of a bearer bond is whatever asshole physically holds the piece of paper! Well then I dunno why you\'re so pissed off.    Technically that money was mine.    And mine!   Your money?   And yours! And dickbrain\'s here! And Cyril\'s! Pam\'s! Everybody\'s! Because your mother cleaned out   all the ISIS 401K accounts!   What?   I have a 401K?   Not anymore! I had almost two hundred grand in there, you okay, yeah, that\'s it.  Down! Ray, put it down or I swear Archer! I will put you down.  How am I the bad guy? Mother\'s the one who stole our retirement money! All I did was Foolishly lose it.  He does have a point.  Why would she pay four million bucks for unverified information? Well, either she\'s getting Alzheimer\'s   Or she thinks it\'s another sex tape.    Hey! Actually that wouldn\'t surprise me.  Well whatever\'s on the disk, Lachouffe expects four million dollars in bearer bonds, and we only have one million Or eight hundred thousand.  For which there is no receipt.  Look, Lana, I feel bad enough as it is.    You couldn\'t feel bad enough.    Eh.  Shut up, so here\'s what we\'re gonna do.  First, we have to keep Malory occupied while we go meet Lachouffe She\'s in the bar, hitting on a duke I bet you get chilly at night, all alone in that great big castle But judging from the way Sir Duke was eye banging the waiters, I don\'t think she\'s gonna have much luck.  So Ray,   that\'s where you come in   Ew!   Yeah, he\'s like a thousand.    You\'re not gonna have sex with him Well wait, he is a duke No means no.  Because you\'ll be ngmaking the exchange with Lachouffe.    But wait, he\'s expecting Mother.    Yeah When Lachouffe realizes we don\'t have four million dollars in bearer bonds   Perfidie! Les tuer!   We\'ll take out his bodyguards.  a suffit! What the hell does she keep in here? Buckles? Then, having retrieved your mother\'s disgusting sex tape Alleged discusting.  Although probably disgusting.  We figure out a way to get our 401K money back.  Yeah hi, duh, we just steal the bearer bonds from the casino.    If they\'re even in the casino!   Well where else would they be, Ray? Taxi! Taxi! Oh, shit.  C\'est le Grand Prix Well you better hope they\'re in the vault.  Ray, hurry up.  Get changed.  Im goog.  It\'s the second qualifying round of the Monaco Grand Prix and oh, they\'re really burning up the streets of Monte Carlo! Oh, it\'s just grrreat! No, this is not at all great! Why not? They\'re already tied up, and we don\'t even have any rope, so Man, you can have these control tops.  No wonder your mother\'s such a bitch.  Can you not rub your dick in my mother\'s pantyhose? Please?   Archer!   What, Lana? Look at him Why would somebody tie up the guards? Duh! So they could rob the Oh shit.    Dis moi maintenant.  Qui a vol le coffre fort ?   Benoit !   Balls.    Quand ? Dix minutes.  Il a pris des papiers!   O va t il ?   How the hell would he know? Oh, right.  Desole.  Well he couldn\'t have gone far in ten minutes,   it\'s a zoo out there.    There\'s a zoo here?   The Gran Prix!   They could have both! Lana ! Zoo ? Ici ? Go, dumbass! Because if we don\'t get my 401K back, you won\'t live long enough to regret you were ever born.  Doesn\'t even make sense Now is that bulletproof, or what? Yeah, y\'all I didn\'t even feel that!   This shit\'s pretty tight, man.    I can let it out, and I can let all this stuff go for forty one thousand six hundred eighty eight dollars, and I\'ll even throw in the Chokebot.  Krieger, what the hell are you doing? I\'m selling ISIS equipment until I get every damn cent of my 401K back! Oh So hey, how\'d you guys like a color copier and about, say, eighty computers?   For your clubhouse.    And some blowjobs.  I mean printers.    Dammit, we\'re never gonna find Benoit!   Balls, and we might if you two would stop being bitches for five seconds! Case in point, Lana! That\'s Oh.  Hand over the bag, Benoit!   Balls!   Dammit, that\'s my   Au revoir, suckairs!   Benoooiiiit! Balls, no, the moment\'s ruined.    We\'re ruined!   How\'re we supposed to catch him now? Wow, this might be hard to drive with such a huge, throbbing erection.  Wooo hoooooo! Well Dennis, it\'s a strange tairn of events here at the Grand Prix! Because look here now, who could believe it? A woman driving in Formula One race! And a Ngresse at that! No, you just don\'t see that everyday! Or that.  He\'s heading for the coast road! Hey thanks, Captain Obvious!   Dukes!   Is it obvious he has a gun? Well yeah, now   Ow do you like those pommes?   How do you like \'em? What the hell\' are you doing? Shooting out his tires so he loses control and flies off the cliff!   With the bearer bonds?   Yes, Lana, with the Benoit! Balls! That was actually pretty ballsy And I never got my swan shaped towels! I can\'t see, you fool! Get off!   I am getting off! I love this!   Archer!   Not now, Lana!   Yes! Now! Dammit Lana, I said not Oh shit!   Nice plan, Lana!   What Oh, rocket launcher.  Y\'all!

Yeah, an attack helicopter and a rocket launcher, Lana,   I think I see it!   Not that! I see it, Lana! There\'s this new thing called situational awareness? Great! Tell that to Benoit! Balls.    Meeeeerrrrrr   Meeeeeeeerrrrde!   Waagh!   Archer! The money! Where\'s the money? It\'s right here, Ray! And I\'m fine, since you asked.    Yeah, I didn\'t.    Hey, ya know what? So, guess that\'s it for Lachouffe and Benoit Balls! Nailed it! And speaking of You are so lucky this worked out.  Well you know what they say, Lana, unlucky at cards, lucky at a whole shitload of all kinds of other stuff.    Yeah, you\'re the best.    Thank you.  Why are you drinking again? ! We\'re meeting Lachouffe   in ten minutes!   Already did.  You Oh! And I just assume I don\'t wanna know what\'s on that.  Don\'t worry, Nosey Parker, you won\'t.  But it\'s a lot more interesting than my afternoon.  You\'d think that duke had never been with a woman before   Would vomit, too tired.    Oh shut up.  And every dime of the four million better be in that bag.    It is, and while we\'re on the subject   Thanks for stealing   our 401K money!   I first of all, if that\'s my Chanel suit I will have your guts for garters   You need some garters.    And second of all, I didn\'t steal that money, I merely borrowed it.  Well just for the record? I think using our 401K\'s as your personal ATM machine was incredibly lame.  And just for the record I don\'t care.  That being said, we better hurry up and redeposit this.  No telling what those idiots might do if they find out their measly 401K\'s are missing Been a real pleasure doin business with y\'all.    Especially you, Pam.    Holla! Uh huh.  A\'ight, peace out! So wait, they\'re gonna fence all that stuff and then pay us for it?   Damn it!   Way to go, stupid.  Me? Hey, I\'m not the one who was handing out blowjobs like puffy stickers! Aw, shit! Plus I gave \'em all my stickers.Not once, not ever has he volunteered for a dangerous mission, and now all of a sudden he\'s like "Let me go"?! On a night jump in the freezin ass cold to kill a Finnish double agent? Please.  So I\'m like "Yeah, let Archer go!" But she\'s like "Ray, it\'s your mission and that\'s final!" And why? Cause just between us gals and the C 130, I think she used to screw, ick, Nikolai Jakov, the head of the KGB! I know, right?! And I think Archer wanted this mission so he could cross into Russia cause he thinks Jakov might be his father! And y\'all know me, I\'m no gossip, but that\'s some scandalous ass shit right there   What.  Dukes.    Ray? If it\'s any consolation, you were right.  Oh, and try not to be unconscious too long.  It\'s super bad for you.  Hey thanks guys.  Just tell my mother I pulled a gun on you, all right.  This is to share.  Look at me! To share! You nut.  O. K.  Got my fake documents, plenty of cash, so the crossing should be a breeze.  Drive to Saint Pete, grab a latte, then 400 miles to Moscow Putting me there right about the time Nikolai Jakov, head of the KGB, comes home for his borscht, only to find an unexpected dinner guest.  Who may be his son.  And for dessert, we will have the truth.  You hear that, Mother? After a lifetime of your secrets and lies, we will finally have the truth! And also hopefully shitloads of vodka.  Woo hoooo!   Parachuuuuuuuuuuuuute!   Chief, why\'s the door still Wait, don\'t tell me he   just now jumped!   Yep.  Like just just now?! Yep.  You know he missed the drop zone by like, eight miles.    Yep.    Jesushe give you the money?   Nope.    What an asshole.  Yep.  Huh.  Hei, jtkt! Tm suomalainen laskurjo klubi?

That\'s a broken zygomatic bone, plus I was unconscious for an hour!   Ooh, really?   Which is super bad for you!   Super bad, have you seen a neurologist?   Have a cat scan tomorrow.  Well unless it\'s in Russia you\'d just better cancel it! Well it\'s obviously not, and what? The mission you failed was right on the border and I think Sterling might be trying   to cross into Russia!   Why would he oh, is this about   Nikolai Jakov, the head of the KGB?   I who?

Pam, I should have you   flensed, and what in God\'s name do you people want?   More rubber cement.  And SIGINT said to give this to you.  Radio chatter about an American agent the KGB caught parachuting into Russia?   Oh my God, really?!   Hey, where\'s Archer? Probably hanging by his Achilles tendons in some KGB hellhole! Caught at border, taken to Vyborg?! Ray, get your purse and take some Midol,   you\'re going back for him!   Mmm, according to these notes from my doctor, a radiologist, and my new neurologist, I\'m doing no such thing.    You little! Okay, then Lana!   Yes? Start at the KGB field office in Vyborg, if he\'s not being held there go to Saint Petersburg, and if he\'s not there, you go straight to Moscow!   Undercover?   Wh ? Of course undercover!   As what, Russia\'s only black woman?   Damn it! I can\'t have this getting blabbed all over the agency, but oh God, someone has to go rescue my son! Before he talks to Nikolai Jakov! Well that someone needs to be fluent in Russian, a few contacts in the KGB wouldn\'t hurt could, um, this someone be from outside the agency? Nooo, no no no no! Oh, now I know you two have had your little differences in the past, but Differences?! You remember he shattered my femur, right? Which is why I\'m in New York, by the way,   I need all new pins put in it!   And I\'m sure that must be   Oh! And he sodomized my fiance!   You\'re still together?! Sorry, ex fiance! That`s what I meant to say.  Well, then it wasn\'t meant to be.    I I don\'t even know how to respond to that.    What is meant to be is your going to Russia to bring back my son before he does any damage.    Or more damage.    One million dollars.    Well, if you can divide that by four.    Wh ? C\'mon, this is your son\'s life! And my money.  Fifty now, two hundred when you bring him back.    Alive.    I\'ll do it on one condition.    No!   Lana, please! I am not having sex with Barry!   You did it once!   By accident! Mostly.  And you were about to, when you thought it would get you my job! That was for work! This is just for Archer.  His life may very well depend on it.    But he\'s such a douchebag   I know, dear but he\'s also my son.  Not Archer! Well, also very much Archer,   but I\'m talking about Barry!   Who is, in fact, sitting right here.  So you wanna do it on the desk, or hallway, where you wanna knock this out?   Wherever.  After you bring back Archer.    Oh no, no, no.  Before.  We`re doing it before.    After.  Non negotiable.    Then can I bring you back anything from Moscow?   Maybe some nesting dolls of my penis?   Sterling\'s already in Moscow?! According to ODIN\'s guy in the KGB.    Which, as a real agency, we have.    We\'ve got guys in the KGB too, smarty!   Yeah, so I hear   Damn that Pam!   I\'m still not eavesdropping!   Well don\'t just stand here, Sterling\'s probably being   tortured as we speak!   Don\'t worry, he\'s a high value asset.    I\'m sure they\'re treating him just fine   So uh, yeah Kinda wishing I\'d taken my training more seriously right about now Which is pretty rare for me.  Hi.  I swear I\'m just a Finnish skydiving enthusiast who  Shit, why am I speaking English?! With an American accent!   Mebbe becuz you are Sterlink Archer?   Who?

Are you implying   my mother gave virgin birth, or what do you?   No! Barry! I was implying that Actually I dunno what I was implying, I just said it.    But I think we may have a problem.

Okay   Take me with you!   Okay! Super glad I didn\'t wet my pants.Sterling Archer.  The world\'s most dangerous spy   Oh, I don\'t know about all that   No? Well, do you know that I fell in love the moment I saw you? Really? With who?   You silly man, who do you think?   Well I dunno,   there were a lot of guys there   Not when I was finished Oh, then it was just me.  And you Me and you I like the way that sounds.  Me too.  Me, and you, and    Aaagh! Hellooo What, in the name of pre paid venereal disease, do you think you\'re doing?! I, uh    Darling, I know she is old, but you allow such talk from your secretary?   His what?   No, she\'s not my, um Katya, this is actually my mother   Boz moy!   And mother, this is Katya Kazanova.  She saved my life in Moscow, she\'s former KGB, she wants to defect and become an ISIS agent, uh, she\'s    Mortified! I beg your forgiveness! I\'m sure you do.  And don\'t you want to freshen up   after your long ride?   Phrasing, mother! Sorry, Katya,   It\'s fine darling, please excuse me.    Check the break room, maybe you\'ll get lucky and find some wet naps! And you.    Go see Krieger this instant.    Wh ? I don\'t need a doctor, mother,   Katya doesn\'t have VD!   You haven\'t had sex with her? Ha ha.  For your      That was pretty good.    I want Krieger to X ray that tiny brain of yours, because obviously the Russians put another chip in it! Wh ? No they didn\'t! Well then you\'re as dumb as you are stupid, because best case scenario, that Russian tramp wants to con you into marriage for a green card, and      Ha!   Oh for    Why doesn\'t everybody just come in here?! It\'s O. K. , we can hear from out here! With our earballs! And I don\'t think you need to worry about Archer ever getting married.    Hey ya know what?   Well I\'m sure he will,   if he ever meets the right girl, but      Wh ? ! What was I,   the wrong one?!   Oh, you know what I mean.    Do I?   Doesn\'t matter, because worst case, that woman   is a KGB double agent!   Mother, she saved my life! She\'s not a    Oh, yeah okay, I see what\'s happening here You\'re both jealous!   What?!   What?! It\'s understandable from you, Lana      But from you, mother, kinda creepy.    First of all      I think it\'s a little weird      Right?  That a KGB agent wants to come over to ISIS, right when Krieger\'s finishing his top secret project.  Wh ? ! She killed like, ten Russians to save my life! So trust me, she\'s not interested in Krieger\'s project! No, trust me, I am wery interested Well, I probably shouldn\'t show you this, buuuuuut, I\'m totally going to.    Bozhe moy!   Right? Almost as cool as my van   Dr.  Krieger, this is amazing!   Oh, I don\'t know about all that But this technology could forever alter the balance of world power! If you\'re into power, let\'s go down to my van, because "red barchetta" through a ten gigawatt pre amp is    Wait,   please tell me you\'re into rush.    Oh, the only "rush" I know is my love   for your comrade, Sterling Archer.    Womp womp But surely, a brilliant scientist like you? How is it you are single? Eh, I almost got married once.  Church, reception,   I had it all lined up   Really Yeah, but    Kreega San My cherry blossomsare wilting But "society" couldn\'t deal with it.  Katya\'s not trying to con me into marriage! I mean, she did move in with me, but      What?!   She\'s living with you?! Mmmwhich is funny why? Mmmbecause if I recall, you have kind of a problem sharing your space?   Lanaaa! What are you doing?!   Brushing my teeth!   In the sink?!   Where should I do it, in the toilet?!   I mean   Ughhhh! Well whatever and shut up, and if you don\'t make Katya an ISIS agent, mother, I\'ll   I will quit ISIS!   Here, drink this, you\'re talking crazy.  No thanks, I promised Katya I\'d quit drinking.  Speaking of, where is she?   No words.  My words have failed me.    Well then shut up.    So? What do you think?   Oh sorry, I thought you said shut up.  And yet you talk.  But I\'ll just bet Nikolai Jakov is so jealous of my   ahem   friendship with Len Trexler, that he planned this whole thing Of course I did nut plan the traitor Kazanova\'s defection! But I hed to tell the party chermen it was part of my mester genius plen! Because the traitor Kazanova knows too much   More like lemon party chermen   So I must ensure she never tells the west what she knows, or I will get    Egg on your face.    Bah! More like bullet in my bren!   No, you heff ektual egg on your face.    Wh ? ! Bah!   Is why party chermen kept doing this.    I hope.    Shut up, idiot, and help me think! Dun\'t worry, I hev ektual genius plen to sulve Kazanova problem.    Wh ? Well what it is?!   If I tell you all et once your head might explode.  Along with combover.  Katya? Baby, you in there? Katya! Rrgh! She\'s not in here, dumbass! And this deuce ain\'t gonna drop itself! Ugh, you realize I can never unhear that sentence, Pam.  And why\'re you crying? Cause I got ripped in a bar last night, and I was tryna beat my record for crammin pool balls in my mouth when some a hole slaps me on the back, and      No.  You swallowed a pool ball?!   I wish just one.  And I still got two to go, so if ya don\'t mind?! Wait, Pam I had Damn, what was it? Something about "stripes and solids"? Speaking of, would you describe your relationship with Katya as solid, or    You know what\'s solid? This wall.  Yeah, so\'s the floor, my fist,   uh ooh! Cyril! The butt of my gun?   Okay.  I get it   Do you?   Oh yes, believe me doctor, this is all very interesting information   Yeah, it totally is.    What the hell is going on in here?! My God, Krieger, why not just give her the project on a floppy disk?! It\'s way too big for that.    No, I just wanted      A green card?! Or a big parade in Red Square when you come back to Moscow with our top secret project! What the hell?!   Darling, I wasn\'t doing anything, I      For God\'s sake, Lana have some pride once in your life! Look, I know it just kills you   that I\'m in love with Katya      First of all    Especially since you and I had sex very recently   when I had cancer!   What? !   What?! It\'s okay, it was just cancer sex.  But it\'s over, Lana, get on with your life! And let me get on with mine! Well at least you got some closure.  Which is more than I ever got Oh you are just your mother all over! Darling please,   I just want to leave   No, Katya, don\'t you see? That\'s exactly what mother wants!   So you can you hack into the KGB servers?   Pff!   Does one ring rule them all?   One ring? No, don\'t engage him, from there it\'s all just orcs and gollums and balrogs.  Okay, pull up Katya\'s KGB personnel file.    But darling, I      Hush, it\'ll show you\'ve been disavowed by the KGB, and then mother will    Yes, gasp, because she\'ll be so confused? Katya, what\'s?! No Katya, wait! Katyaaa! How long until mother sees this?!   O. K.  Ow, and that kind of depends.    Oh, shit!   Wait\'ll everybody sees this!   Oh, shit! Oh, shit! Penetrate deep, destroy from within.  Oh shit.  So, you fake Kazanova\'s file, those fools et ISIS hack into it   End then we begin phase three.    Wait, what is phase two?   Phase two is I want a promotion.    Damn those KGB pigs! Faking my file so that everyone here thinks I am    A double agent!   Darling I swear, it\'s a fake!   Just what a double agent would say.  Stay back! Darling, don\'t make me    I\'m kidding! Baby c\'mon, relax.  Although, that is probably what you\'d say   if you were a double agent   I\'m not!   How can I prove to you?!   You don\'t have to.  Look at me.    Even if you were I wouldn\'t care.    Really? Yes, really.  Katya, I love you.  But you\'re not though, right?   No!   Awesome.  And once we explain it all to mother, I\'m sure she\'ll say      Shoot her!   Wh ?! Katya! On your knees, hands behind your head, and toss out the weapon!   Although not in that order!   Not in any order! Mother, this is all just a huge misunderstanding!   I am not a double agent!   Just what a double agent would say    We\'ve covered that! Mother listen      Lana shoot her! That is an order!   Sorry, Archer   Lana no!   Sorry, darling Wait, no no no no      Holy shit   I\'m sorry I had to do that, darling, please don\'t hate me! Are you kidding?! I\'ve never been this turned on in my entire life!   That little bitch   Don\'t worry, she won\'t get far.  I\'m locking ISIS down, top to bottom! It\'s pound pound six pound five two.  Duh! Pound, pound, six      You\'re, hitting, star.    Security system offline.    Damn it.  Oh okay, here we go      Restarting, in      Ten, minutes.    Damn it! I bet mother was hitting star again! But darling, where will we go? Anywhere but there.  Because as sexy as it was,   shooting at Lana      Just her weapons! Believe me,   if I wanted to hit her, I could have.    Well yeah, she\'s huge.  What about helping me escape?! What if they think you are double agent?! C\'mon, they think I\'m a lot of   really shitty things, but   But he\'s not a double agent!   Are you retarded?   Well he\'s an idiot and a shitbird.    Well then how do you explain this?   Bad parenting.  That was taken outside the parking garage not five minutes ago!   After Slutya Slutsakova did this!   After? Why didn\'t you lock down the building?! Security system restarting, in five    You were hitting star again? Zip it, you two! Because it kills me to say this, but Sterling\'s obviously been flipped by that Russian whore, so we have to treat them both As double agents.  For God\'s sake, woman, are you hearing yourself?   He\'s your son, not a      Ray, she got him to quit drinking.  So what\'s the plan? Sterling will go to ground, but he\'ll need to pick up his bug out bag, so    Woodhouse? Listen very carefully   God damn, Woodhouse, are you deaf?   A bit, yes, but I\'m afraid I know nothing about this    What was it? My bug out bag! It was right here! It\'s a calfskin Herms grip, and it\'s full of fake passports and mustaches, uh, oh!   And two hundred grand in cash!   And   Calfskin, you said?   Woodhouse, do you like to travel? Because if you don\'t find that bag I will empty the entire contents of your body and   use your leathery skin as a replacement!   I shall check my sewing room!   Wait, his what?   But even with money and passports      And mustaches      Where will we go?! If ISIS thinks that you are a double agent we can\'t stay here, and if we go back to Russia Russia? Look, no offense, but standing in line for beets and toilet paper isn\'t my idea of a good time.  Oh, is not so bad, you take a crossword, catch up with your neighbors Neighbors, that\'s it! We\'ll go to Canada and work for the    Wait, does Canada even have a spy agency?   Yes, but      Why? It\'s Canada.     Don\'t you see? Wherever we go, someone will always be hunting us! So let \'em hunt! Katya, we\'re the two best secret agents in the world! So nyet promotion, because you still hev nut sulved my Kazanova problyem!   Hang on, hesty pudding   Pitch is out, I can\'t hold altitude!   What?!   I can\'t hold it, she\'s breaking up! Barry Dylan, ODIN agent.  A man barely alive.  Gentlemen, we can rebuild him.  We have the technology.  We have the capability to make the world\'s first bionic man.  Barry Dylan will be that man.  Better then he was before.  Better.  Stronger.  Faster.  Bozhe moy! This is amazink! Ken we ektually create such a think?! Can and did! I greenlit the project way back.    So, about that promotion      I wunt to see this, this Bionik Barry! Well, then you\'d better pack a bag And what brings you to New York, Mr.  Berg? Business or pleasure?   Oh, pleasure.  Definitely pleasure.    All righty.    Welcome to the United States.    Thanks.  Or shalom or whatever it is we say.  Because I\'m one step ahead of you.  Like always.  And we\'ll always be one step ahead of them.  No matter who\'s hunting us.  Even if it\'s, oh, I don\'t know, a criminally insane cyborg.  So, er, comrade Bionik Barry.  Ken you sulve my Kazanova problyem? Yeah, probably If I knew and/or cared who and/or what that was.  But since I don\'t and/or do not, I am going to kill and/or murder Sterling Archer.  Wh ? ! No, no!   Archer may be my son!   Well, too bad.  You\'ve sown the wind, and now you shall reap The Barry.  I said don\'t take the bridge, dickhead!   Hail Mary mother of      Reset the f\'in meter! Oh God! Actually, you know what? Let\'s uh, let\'s put a pin in that promotion.    Darling, please! Forget the bag!   We need it, and hey, what about this? Canada\'s got casinos, right? But they could be here any minute! Who, ISIS? Baby c\'mon, remember who we\'re dealing with here Here we are! I swear, if anyone saw me in this awful van.  How could they, with this illegalass window tint? Dude, this van\'s like rolling probable cause.  So all ashore from the S. S.  date rape! Toot toot.  I\'m serious, Woodhouse, either find that bag or a magic marker, so we can draw where the zippers are gonna go on your    body.  Afraid I haven\'t seen a magic marker either, sir.    Bit of a mess in here   Was this    my billiard room?! At one time, yes, but I needed a place to sew your suits, you see, so      Sir?   It doesn\'t matter, Woodhouse, I\'m leaving, go nuts.  Hang a bunch of   Georgia O\'Keeffe posters.    But sir, you can\'t leave.    Your mother      Can also hang.  Woodhouse, for the first time in my life, I am in love.  And nobody, especially mother, is going to ruin that for me.  You\'re    you\'re serious, aren\'t you? Woodhouse, I quit drinking for her.  Ahh.  Just that one.  I\'m scared if I stop all at once the cumulative hangover will literally kill me.  Well, if you truly love Ms.  Kazanova   I\'d like for you to have this.    Whoa.  Wait, is that      No, I guess it wouldn\'t be mother\'s   No sir,   it was her mother\'s.    Bub? Darling, we really must go! Hang on, just uh, doing something   Please don\'t make him into a suitcase!   I\'m not! But Woodhouse, I need my    Did you have that the whole time?   Yes sir.    Well then goodbye, Woodhouse, and oh, you\'re fired.  Er, technically your mother is my employer, so    Really? Who do you think\'s been paying my salary all these years? I just thought you were    Well, slave\'s not the right word, but    Really?   Mother pays you?   Yes sir, and      Sterling, dear!   Wh ?! She also has her own key.  If you come out to the living room, I have a surprise for you! That\'s the exact same thing she said when I was five, and I spilled grape tang on her stupid flokati rug.  What was the surprise? Apparently how bad a ping pong paddle hurts on a tiny bare ass.  And so   But darling Are you sure?   Yeah it hurt like crazy.    No, about this! About us.    Katya, I swear to you,   I\'ve never been more sure about anything.    Then I am with you.    All the way.    Okay but no shots center mass,   just try to wing \'em.  Oh, and Woodhouse?   Yes sir? Totally being sarcastic about the Georgia O\'Keeffe posters.  Do not do that.  Okay Coming motheerrrrrrr!   Shit, I\'m out!   I am also out! Uh, actually so am I   Dukes, me too.    Me too.  Seriously? Is anybody hit?   Uh, no.    Huh.  Not really the explosive climax I thought it was gonna be Is nobody gonna touch that, seriously? Not just yet.  Because I lied.  I still have one in the chamber, and it\'s got your name on it, missy.  Mother no! Look, I know you\'re having a    really disturbingly hard time with this, but   I am in love with Katya!   Damn it Sterling,   she\'s a double agent!   I swear to you I am not! The KGB faked her file, mother.    Oh, whatever! Although   Yeah it\'s the first thing they\'d do.  That\'s like, counterintelligence 101.  But then    why was she taking notes about Krieger\'s secret project?! Ooh, sorry.  I knew I forgot to mention something   And it was this.    Uh Darling, I told you that I fell in love with you when we first met, butI am afraid that was a lie.    Called it!   I fell in love with you long ago Because this man, Sterling Archer is Russia\'s most dangerous enemy! And heis the man I will marry.    So all this time, you wanted      To marry you! So when Dr.  Krieger told me he already paid deposits with florist, and caterer,   and that his wedding will never happen, I      Kreega San, you promised    We will talk about it, in the van! Well, since it sounds like I don\'t have to help with the wedding plans   Katya? Will you marry me?   Bozhe moy! Da! Da!   A thousand times da!   Awesome.  I thought I\'d be dead long before this day ever came.    Actually, hoped.    Oh shut up.    You old sour puss.    Because this day has come, mother!   We can get married right here!   Really? Well, not here here.  On the terrace.  Thank you all so much for coming! Oh, and I just love your hair! Well, I hate it I look like a whore.  And you made it all so beautiful, Woodhouse! Thank you, thank you.  Don\'t thank him, it sets a bad precedent.  And plus we still need a priest, so    How bout a disgraced former minister?   What the shit?!   Long story, kinda boring, but I am still licensed by the state to perform marriages the irony of which is not lost on me.  Yeah, ya wanna know what\'s really ironic?   Barry!   Yes, Barry, hi, and what\'s ironic, is Archer, besides sodomizing my fiance      What?   Only by the strictest legal definition.  Threw me off a roof! Twice! Dropped, Barry, and how are you not dead?! Because the Russians, turned me into The unholy abomination of metal fused with flesh which now stands before you! They have this technology?! Eight years on my secret project! Wasted! Yeah, so back to the irony, now I\'m going to throw you off the roof!   Wow Barry, you\'re like, super strong.    Yeah, did I mention I was a cyborg? Yeah you did, can somebody shoot him?!   Dukes!   Archer, we\'re out of ammo! Well I\'m not! And if anyone\'s going to ruin my son\'s weddingIt\'ll be me.  What part of "I\'m a cyborg" are you people still not getting, exactly? Core concept? I guess? But    no no wait, Katya nooo!   Yes! I will save you, darling!   No no no don\'t      Katyaaa!   Archerrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr! I love yoooooooooooou! Nooooooo! Yesss! One for three off the roof, bitch! Oh Katya, no ho ho haaaaaaaagh! Waaaaaagh hah hah haaaaaaaghhh! Why the hell Why the hell are you crying?! That was my vanAgent Sterling Archer, codename Duchess.  Licensed to kill.  Primary skills: covert operations.  Unarmed combat.  Firearms.  Explosives.  Asset acquisition.  Enemy agent disposal.  Current status: missing.  For three months! Sterling\'s been missing for three months and you idiots have nothing! Well name calling\'s not gonna get us    Anywhere.  Which is where Archer could be.  Malory, we\'ve checked every safe house, run down every lead And he hasn\'t touched any of his bank accounts, so unless he oh.  Were you gonna say "unless he\'s been skimming tons of cash from his operations accounts all these years"? Yeah, duh, right? Wh ? He wouldn\'t dare steal from me! Oh please, we all    think he would dare to do that.  So we\'ve got a g highly ih skilled covert agent, who probably has millions of dollars in cash Who doesn\'t want to be found.  Being looked for by people who don\'t want to find him! What does that mean? Oh, don\'t give me that! You\'re all secretly delighted that he\'s gone!   I wouldn\'t say delighted, but   I cannot say I miss the bullying.  Me neither.  Plus ISIS actually turned a profit this quarter.  Be that as it    no, never mind! Because since you\'ve all been half assedly phoning it in    Malory, he can\'t! Be found!   I mean, if he\'s even stillum   Still what.  Aliiive.  Jeezow, talk about duh.  I bet he totally already killed himself.  No he didn\'t! Because my skeevy Russian fiance wasn\'t murdered in front of my very eyeballs at my stupid wedding! Noooooooooooooooooooo! Kaaatyaaa! Noooo ho ho wah ha haaa! Woooooh! How\'s it feel, Archer?! Now both our weddings are canceled! Baarryyyyyyy! Is that how you crash a wedding?   Yes it is, Bionic Barry, yes it is   No! No matter how distraught Sterling is over Katya, he won\'t kill himself.  He\'d never do that to me.  He\'s alive, somewhere, and since you fools can\'t find him I called in someone who can.  Say hello to Rip Riley, manhunter.  Manhunter?   Now if that is the pot calling the kettle black   Oh Rip, you old so and so! How are you, Malory? Besides gorgeous? Oh I\'m not, I\'m a mess! I\'m worried half to death about Sterling, and    Well, don\'t be.  I tracked him down.  Already?! Wh ? How?! Uh, this new thing called intelligence gathering? Anyhoo, he\'s on a little island called Wapuni in French Polynesia      With his millions in caaaash   Tending bar.  Or nooooot.  So I\'ll pick him up tonight, then say, three days back to New York,   so if you\'re not busy Friday night   I\'ll book us our old booth at 21.  Outstanding.  Riley out.  What a hunk! Total sploosh.  Actually yeah, gotta give him the sploosh.  And, whatever my equivalent of sploosh is, which, I guess is just sploosh.  Only with semen.  Oh my God, I can\'t believe I just did that You know, I\'m not like that    No, hey c\'mon, don\'t do that Don\'t ruin your post coital bliss with a bunch of misplaced guilt.  How is it misplaced, I\'m on my honeymoo hooon! Well at least you got a honeymoon! My fiance was murdered!   Wait, what?   Yeah! Oh! And you married an idiot! Who plays thirty six holes of golf on the first day of his honeymoon? Because not to, whatever, but that cannot bode well for your marriage.  Get the hell out, you piece of shit! Seriously, I hope she didn\'t sign a pre nup, because    Oh my God! Hey so, what happened was, somebody ordered room service, but the regular room service guy, uh, he died, so I came in here and fell on the bed    Wait, you\'re not her husband.  And you\'re not one of my dick bosses, so can I help you, or? Yes, you can quickly and quietly walk down to the dock and board my seaplane.  Okay A, rhetorical, and B, your what? Seaplane? Looks like an airplane had a baby with a boat? I know what a seaplane is, idiot! And yet you\'re surprisingly unclear on the phrase "quickly and quietly. " And even more unclear on who you are? Name\'s Rip Riley.  Your mother hired me to bring you back, Sterling.  She what?! I mean who?! I\'m Randy! See? So you can just go back to that other guy\'s mother and tell her that even if you did find that other guy, he\'s never coming back to ISIS! Wait, did you say ISIS, or? How did ISIS suddenly get in the mix, is what I\'m asking.  And I\'m asking you, for the last time, to get on that plane.  Ya wanna try and make me? No, I don\'t.  And I promise    you don\'t want that either.  Hey, so listen I think we got off on the wrong foot? But I\'m willing to, ya know, let bygones be gone by the wayside Good to know But I\'m there yet.  Well, give it some time.  Speaking of, how long is this stupid flight?   Eh, about forty hours in the air   Hooray But I have to island hop to re fuel.  Old Lucy Goosey here only has a range of about a thousand nautical miles.  Making it wildly impractical, got it.  This plane is totally practical! Maybe for this ridiculous image you\'re trying   to cultivate for yourself   What image? Sky Captain of Yesteryeeear! At least I\'m not sky captain of I ran away from home, I didn\'t run away from home! I\'m a grown man! Whose fiance was murdered in front of his very eyes! So excuse me for needing some time to grieve! By tending bar and banging newlyweds? Apparently that\'s my grieving process! And also I need to use the bathroom! A, it\'s called the head.  And B, no.  Pee in your pants.  Yeah, wrong number.  And I\'ve literally had nothing but liquor and mangoes for three months, so unless you wanna fly a thousand nautical miles sitting next to that Okay, I\'m setting the auto pilot.  But this better not be a ruse.  A ruse? Brrring! Brrring! Hello? Hi, it\'s the 1930\'s, can we have our words and clothes and shitty airplane back? Let\'s go, kid.  Call ya back, 1930\'s! And hey, watch out for that Adolf Hitler! He\'s a bad egg! No, one pedal fills it with water    I did that! And the other pedal flushes it! No, it doesn\'t! Ugh, you come try, I gotta choke down this gag reflex.  Yeah, ha ha! Quit being a dick for five seconds and unlock the door! It doesn\'t have a lock! Dammit, I\'m gonna puke and there\'s no room in the toilet or the sink! What the hell\'d you put in the sink?! A ruse! You big dumb idiot.  And also a bunch of shaving cream and toilet paper.  Just because.  And where does Malory get off implying we didn\'t try our best to find Archer? No, she straight up said it.  What she implied was that we\'re jealous of Archer, and that you hate yourself cause you\'re still attracted to him.  I    that\'s    what?! Oh please, you\'re so hot for him I could re heat this chili in yer cooch.  Don\'t you have some humans to resource?! Actually, no.  Most of my job\'s dealing with sexual harrassment complaints against Mr.  Archer, so are we gonna some cooch chili or what? Wuzza wuzz What in the holy hell are you doing? Well it was gonna be an Old Fashioned, but I couldn\'t find any bitters, so    How long was I out?! Hard to say.  After I shaved and stuff I took a pretty long nap, so    Uncuff me, you idiot! Holy God, if we overshot our chance to refuel! I thought you put it on auto pilot! It just maintains course and altitude! It doesn\'t know how to find the only airstrip within a thousand miles so it can land itself when it needs gas! Well, then I misunderstood the concept.  Uncuff me! Okay, God! Wait, first promise you won\'t take me back to ISIS! ISIS?! You\'ll be lucky if I can get us back to land! Now uncuff me! Okay, God! Wait a minute.  Is this a ruse? Because if it is? Pretty elaborate.  Dammit! There goes number two! But it can land on water, right?! I mean, isn\'t that the whole point?! It\'s a kinda different story when we\'re dropping like a ton of bricks! Damn, I can barely hold her level! Want me to help steer, or? Haven\'t you done enough already?! Wh ?! How is this suddenly my fault?! Okay, this is it! C\'mon Lucy Goosey, you can do it! Looking good, girl I think we\'re gonna be okay! Wait, you didn\'t put the wheels down! The wh    Noooo! Woooooo! Two personal records! For breath holding and number of sharks shot in the frickin face! Did you see that? Dude are you even alive? No, that side\'s too low! Well I can\'t tell from here! Well I can, and it\'s too low.    I think you mean premature   What\'d you say?! Nothing! It\'s just that Archer obviously doesn\'t want to come back, so I don\'t know how Riley\'s gonna get him on a plane   Which, I bet will crash   Yeahhh! Now you listen! Sterling is coming home safe and sound, and when he does it\'ll be no thanks to you people, so you can forget about getting Carvel! Aww Cookie Puss.  Wuzza wuzz what the what in the holy hell are you doing now?! Ugh, wondering why this is called a D Ration.  Oughta call it a Y ration.  As in "Hey, this tastes like catshit. " They\'re not candy bars, jackass, they\'re survival rations! And they might have to last us a while!   Umm   You son of a    okay, that is it! As of right now, I\'m    what the?! Looking for this? Give me that weapon.  No.  You\'re agitated.  I\'m "agitated" because you crashed my plane in the God knows if it\'s even the middle of the Pacific Ocean! Yeah, which you\'re floating on, and not getting shit out of a shark in! Wait, what? I saved you from a shark! Let\'s see, after I pulled you out of that shitheap of a plane, but before I gave you CPR and bandaged your head! Oh.  Well thanks.  You\'re welcome.  Sorry I ate so much food.  Yeah, that was a pretty dick move If it makes you feel any better I puked most of it up    It doesn\'t    raft\'s pretty bobby.  Well we\'ve got a few gallons of fresh water, a desalinator for when that runs out let\'s see, flare gun and some flares, fishing gear oh! And this guy.  What is that? Emergency beacon.    Beams a signal directly to the ISIS satellite   Oh well that\'s just great! Now I get to deal with this, as my hot meatball sub congeals into a big fat disappointing blob of shit.  Nobody\'s gonna touch that? Yeah.  So I figure three days for ISIS to get a rescue team out here.  Nice! So we just kick back, catch a few rays, catch some sushi Well it\'s not gonna be a picnic, but    Hey, can I check that thing out? Okay, but don\'t mess with the knobs, I\'ve got the frequency all set, so    Hey thanks, Guglielmo Marconi.  Who I think invented the radio.  Over.  But if the emergency beacon is going off    oh my God, their plane crashed! I said that would happen and it did! What if I have psycho kinetic powers?! I dunno, just try to only use em for good.  No.  Well?! Don\'t just sit there sweating like a gigantic cheese! Do something! Ow, and I am.  Our satellite\'s locked on the beacon, which is, jeez, the middle of nowhere.  Lana, Ray! Get there this instant! Uh, sorta following up on his thing about the middle of nowhere how? The black titanium corporate card?! I thought it was just a myth! Like a big, beautiful, no limit unicorn! Charter a private jet to Honolulu, then I don\'t care if you have to buy a plane, get out there and find him! Wait, no, that\'s not in the budget! Say budget to me again, Cyril.  Save your receipts, please.  And call me the very instant you have an update! And you! You lose my son, you\'ll have to drink your meatballs subs through a straw.  Again, ow.  And again, the satellite is locked on the beacon, so unless he, I dunno, throws it away Wh ? Why the hell would he do that?! I told you! I\'m not going back there!   Well, you say that   Riley no shit, I will shoot you.  And then I\'ll shoot you.  With a flare.  And then I\'ll use a D ration bar and two survival crackers to make s\'mores over the crackling fire that used to be your chest cavity.  God damn, dude.  Sorry, but you\'re acting really crazy.  Well?! Being a spy makes you crazy! I mean what kind of job is that, where your fiance gets murdered?! Hello, stress!   Don\'t even get me started on my mother, I mean she      She can be a steel clad bitch, I know, why do you think I left ISIS? Wh ? You were an ISIS agent?! Briefly, way back.  Didn\'t work out, because, ya know, your mother Was impossible to please, right?   God, if you only knew   What? how much your mom loves you! You would at least have the heart to go tell her you\'re quitting in person.  Eesh.    Rather get shot with a flare   Oh, man up! Talk to your mother.  Then you can go be a bartender, and destroy a new marriage every week.  C\'mon, that marriage was doomed.  And so are we, if we don\'t work together out here, so truce? Uh, ya, and hey, we\'re not doomed! Look! Over here! Hey! No no no wait, get down! Wh ? Don\'t you wanna get rescued? Yeah, but those could be pirates! Okay, well, they\'ll just have to do \'til we find some cowboys and Indians.  What?! What what.  What\'re you talking about? I\'m sorry I didn\'t know pirates werestill a real thing.  Man, this is not at all what I pictured I mean, you hear "pirate ship" you think sails, cannonballs oh, and not one of these guys has a beard.    You done?   Hang on.  Planks.  Now I\'m done.  Because the fact that we\'re still alive tells me they wanna try to r    Don\'t say rape.  Ransom us.  Awesome.  Compared to rape.  Which seems like a thing pirates would do.  But those numbskulls who picked us up were so drunk    Now that did seem piratey.     they forgot to search me.  Well, unless you\'ve got a bunch of Navy SEALs   stuffed in your pants   No! I\'ve got the signal beacon! So? So we just stall the pirates until the ISIS rescue team shows up, boards the ship, and takes \'em all out! Bing, Bang, Boom.  Which is funny why? Well, gee, where do I start? I will start with the caviar and the \'38 Montrachet, then do the Kobe tartare with this \'42 Lapin, and then this chocolate terrine looks insaaane.  And then I guess just send me to fat camp and pray to God I don\'t eat all those fat, delicious little chiddrens.  Because I will gobble them up.  Wow, ISIS has really gone downhill.  But there must be some good agents.  It kills me to say it, but it maybe Lana Ray, I doubt that\'s what Malory had in mind when she gave us the card.  Ya know, we are on a rescue mission.  Ugh.  Rescue me from myself such a fatty.  But even so, I wouldn\'t put all my rescue eggs in that basket.  Well?! You got a better plan?! I don\'t, I\'m not really a planner.  My process is a little more organic? Datang! Untuk kapten! So let\'s just play it by ear, see where the afternoon takes us.  See? This is why I like to keep it loose.  I mean the wine\'s crap, but    Oh, sorry.  No offense, captain.  No, I am who am sorry.  This from million dollar yacht.  Now I don\'t feel bad for killing them.    Serves em right, those jerks   But you know wine! You rich man! Who me? No, I\'m    Rich man! My men take this off you! The Omicron Spacemaster! Oh, it\'s actually the Sp    acemaster, yeah.    Good ol\' Spacemaster   To Sterleen Love, Muddah.  You muddah rich lady! Uh oh! Yeah, crazy rich, she invented the splashless urinal cake.  The what? They\'re    doesn\'t matter, she\'s rich and she loves me and I\'m really rich and this is my manservant, uh Jerkins.  Funny stuff.  Not now, Jerkins.  So I bet she\'d pay whatever ransom you ask for.  Splashless urinal cakes have been pretty good to us.  As you can imagine.    This good to hear   But we can\'t do any of that "mail somebody a finger"   shit, or      No, no, no we take you back to my island! Call you muddah, get a big big money! Awesome.  Compared to finger mailing.  So tell me about this island of yours? It\'s a tiny little rock called Pangu Nothin else within a thousand miles, and the beacon\'s been headin straight for it at about twenty knots.  So a ship must have picked them up! But I\'ve never even heard of Pangu.  Is there a naval base there, or? Mmmnot exactly.    It\'s more of a, uh   Pirate fortress.  No, yeah, I just wanted to make sure you said the phrase "pirate fortress. " Which apparently, yes, you did, say the word pirate, followed by the word    Fortress!   That is the word, My english so crap   Eh, I bet you just need more practice.  Try this: Jerkins, you\'re a douchebag! Funny stuff.  Jehkin, you dooshaback! Keep at it.  Oh and hey, did we cross the international date line? Because I can change the date for you on that Omicron Spacemaster.  Eh? Yeah, okay dumb guy Wouldn\'t want to be walking around like a dickhead! With the wrong date on your Omicron Spymaster! Wh ?! Wuzza hell dumb guy? It\'s the Omicron Spymaster! Which is why it\'s got knockout gas and a garrote and I think even a laser and Riley do I have to kill everybody myself?! Huh? Oh! Seriously, what the hell, Riley?! I didn\'t know you were making a move! Uh, dickhead?! Takes one to know one.  No! Dickhead was the go word! How was I supposed to know?! Oh.  Yeah sorry, I forgot to tell you the go word was    Dooshaback! But even still, Riley you gotta be quicker.  I mean, I know you\'re pretty old but    Well now that I know the go word, I    No, idiot, it changes every time.  Well what is it now? Pirates! Kinda confusing, since we\'re on a    Owww! Come on, that was right next to my frickin ear! Sorry, I know that hurts.  Happens to me kind of a lot.  I actually have like mild tinnitis now.  I mean, it\'s gotten to where I had to start sleeping with a fan on.  Oh my God Yeah, otherwise it\'s like eeeeeeeeeee.  No, you just killed like, ten pirates.  Wow, and if the five year old me knew that he would get a huge boner.  No idea why I said that.  Well once these idiots figure out they can turn those twenty millimeter cannons on the wheelhouse, we\'ll be    kinda confused.  What are they doing? It looks like they\'re surrendering! Why? All they have to do is    Shut up, who cares why? I do! What if it\'s a ruse? It\'s not a ruse! Say something, before they change their minds! Do they speak English? Uh hello, pirates! Who speaks English, let\'s see some hands! Wow, way more than I thought.  Uh, excuse me? Sorry, hi, I\'m Noah? What\'re you, the first mate, or? Oh! Oh God no, no, I\'m a bajak budak? It\'s sort of a    well, I guess the nearest translation is slave pirate? Do you speak English? I do.  They don\'t, though, they\'re just surrendering the ship to you.  Dan benteng? Ya.  And the fort.  You\'re the new captain.  The what?! Well if you kill the old captain, you become the new captain.  I know you don\'t think of pirates as having a lot of rules, but they actually do and that\'s a big one.  Well, tell them hands down! Tangan ke bawah! Holy shit! Did you see that?!   No, I\'m too busy looking at that   What is what am I seeing? Oh, the women always us throw a huge feast when we return to port.  Should I tell them to cancel it, or? Huh? No, we\'re totally feasting! Say that! Mulai pesta! Nice plan.  Once they\'re good and drunk we\'ll turn this tub around and head home.  Home? Riley I am home.  Wh ? ! Over my dead body are you running away to be a pirate! Of course I\'m not gonna be a pirate I\'m gonna be a pirate king.  Aw c\'maaaahn! Clock yer skinny ass out already, and let\'s go get outside some dranks! Ugh, I can\'t! I have to cover her stupid phone in case those stupid pirates call with a stupid ransom demand for Mr.  Stupid Archer! Carol?! Carol! Have they called?! No! Ma\'am! But rest assured I\'ll let you know the minute they dooo! Rest?   My God, who can rest   Not me, apparently.  Or me! I have to re do the annual budget because she\'s blowing it all on this so called rescue of Archer! Well his plane did crash, and the distress signal was last heard coming from a known pirate fortress, so   So?! That doesn\'t mean Ray and Lana have to bankrupt ISIS getting there! Oh, would you relax? You rent a boat, that money\'s gone.  This way, we can sell it when we\'re done.  I bet it\'ll come out cheaper.  I wasn\'t talking about the boat.  I think five grand for the week was a steal.  Look at him, he is lithe.  So a twink escort your rent, but    That\'s different! I mean, they did ask if I wanted to actually buy him, but I thought What, that I\'d be weird about it? That I, perhaps due to my race, might have a problem with the concept of owning a human being? I actually just thought I\'d get tired of him.  You? Mr.  Can\'t Even Commit To A Pet? Wh ? Yeah hi, two cats! One of whom I think has FIP, so commit that.  You know how hard I worked on this budget?! Nights, weekends, canceled my vacation, and now it\'s all wasted! Wasted, exactly, let\'s go be that! C\'mon, happy hour at Pita Margarita\'s! Is that what it sounds like? Only if it sounds like a shitload of tequila and some A rab hoagies.  How dare you?! Arab, sorry.  Oh shut up, how can you even think about happy hour at a time like this?! When probably as we speak, my poor Sterling is being tortured by pirates! I wish What?! Wish you wouldn\'t say that!   Because I\'m sure he\'s not being tortured   Aaaaaaaaaaaagghhhhhhh! Ohhhh my God, stop, stop, stop, seriously I can\'t take anymore! Whew! That was insane, I never even heard of that position! Did the missionaries not swing by here, or? Excuse me? Sorry, pirate king Archer? What! Noah! Ready for the uh, morning briefing? Noah, I\'m half drunk and slathered in every bodily fluid there is.  So yeah, this is about as piratekingy as I\'m gonna get.  Brief away! Okay, item one! The    Noah.  Yes sir? Good morning.  O. K.  Item one.  The huge morale problem.  How do we have a morale problem? Well first of all    C\'mon, karaoke night\'s a big hit Roti dan mentega, bakar dan selai! Woooo! We have an awesome feast every night Woooo! Not to mention intramural lacrosse! Woooo! Woooo! Woooo! So how can they have low morale? Well um, besides all of those things, they haven\'t been paid.  So pay \'em, what do you need, new payroll software? Cyril always handled all that stuff.    Payroll, budgets, he\'s a genius at that crap   Just find the money, Cyril! You\'re an accounting genius, Cyril! That\'s right you bitch.  I said it.  So good luck finding all these Swiss accounts! Mwah ha! Mwah ha ha ha ha haaaaaa! Whatcha doin? Aagh!   Hey, Pam  No, we don\'t need      Oh! And dealing with   disgruntled employees, Pam\'s great at that   Izzat innernet porn? Uh, yep! Just, um just jackin it.  Can I watch? Or izzat weird? It\'s kinda weird.  Is it? Yes.  I think it\'s because she\'s such a good listener.  And she sounds lovely.    But you don\'t need an HR rep and payroll software      Couldn\'t hurt Sir! Please! Pirates work for shares, and since you became pirateking there hasn\'t been any booty, so    Gonna have to go ahead and disagree with you there, buddy.  From pirated ships.  Oh.  I thought you meant from the    Native girls, no.  Sorry, I don\'t know all the pirate terms yet.  Well    I\'m new! To all of this! Especially the actual, you know, piracy part It\'s not really what I expected.  Dammit, I said get over there! For the jillionth time, nobody is raping anybody! Actually no, you know what?! Now nobody gets anything, because I\'m letting him go! Shut up! He\'s a small business owner! If he loses his ship he\'ll be ruined! You can go.  Ooh, but can we get about fifty pounds of tuna steaks? Which you let him talk you down to twenty.  Well?! You know what kinda margins those guys work on?   I actually don\'t   Well nice Ph. D. ! My field\'s anthropology.  And I\'m actually just a doctoral candidate? Or I was, until these guys captured my research vessel and enslaved me   Ugh, not this again   So I was thinking, if you freed me You\'re my translator, I need you.  That\'s why I made you first mate.  Which also went over pretty badly.  Yeah, people hate you so let\'s just put a pin in the whole manumission thing.  But    Noah! Morale\'s low enough as it is.  And I bet I know who\'s to blame! No kidding I\'m not kidding, this Archer guy\'s gonna get you all killed.  He    Riley! Archer, what a coincidence.  I was just talking about you.  With who? Cause that bucktooth little shit doesn\'t even speak English! I do little bit    No you don\'t.     and correct syntax is "with whom!" Man, that is not gonna help morale.  Yeah, Bucky\'s an incorrigible gossip.  Who    to whom you are forbidden to speak! I locked you down here so you couldn\'t contact my mother, not so you could, whatever, sow disharmony! You\'re sowing plenty all by yourself.  Face it kid, you\'re a bust as a pirateking.  King, exactly! And unless you want to spend the rest of the afternoon with a bunch of scorpions, don\'t forget it! And remember, this is a rescue mission.  I heard you.  So don\'t charge in there all crazy, machine gunning everything in sight.  When have I    I\'m sure you\'d love it   if Sterling were killed in some huge crossfire.    Wh ? No I wouldn\'t!    but just try to control all your jealousy and, ick, sexual frustration.  Oh no, you\'re breaking up.  Lana.  I mean, am I jealous because Archer gets preferential treatment? Yes.  But am I still attracted to him? Is a pig\'s ass pork? I\'m sorry, did you wanna hear what I think, or just what you wanna hear? He asked, pretty sarcastically.  Raja lemah! Raja lemah! Kita memerlukan raja baru! Whoa whoa! Bucky! What is this?! We hold erections for king!   Well, flattering, not really necessary   He means elections.  Okay, that makes more    wait, what?! Time for new king! Raja baru! Okay, pirates! Hey! Take a knee! Noah You wanna? That won\'t translate.  It\'s like last week when you said "lend me your ears" and they were like "Apa?" Damn it    I can\'t do idioms.  Shut up.    Then unshut up, and tell them I understand their frustration   Do you? Saya mendengar anda! But you don\'t change horses in mid    Idiom! Now is not the time for a new king! Sekarang tidak ada raja baru! Because the king is strong! Raja yang kuat! If you so strong melawan raja! Yah! Melawan raja! Melawan raja! What\'s melawan raja? King fight.  If the king loses to a challenger in one on one combat, he has to step down.  Or just be dead.  Since when?! Since 19 always.  Did you not read the orientation materials? Woooo! Mmmmore skimmed it? Enough talk! Melawan raja!   Okay Bucky, we\'ll melawan raja   Oh, one thing    Noah shut up and translate.  I accept your challenge! Cabaran diterima! Because your mouth\'s been writing checks your butt can\'t cash, Anda    Do you even know what an idiom is? Colloquial metaphor.  No, it\'s    well actually yes, but I really think this is a bad idea    I\'m not remunerating you to think, Noah! Even if you weren\'t a slave.  And your three fifths of an opinion is noted, so    oh sweet Jesus Jones! See, Bucky doesn\'t have to fight you himself.  He can choose a stand in.  Who is huge! That\'s what I was    Why didn\'t he come out for lacrosse?! You lucky I don\'t let him! Let him? He\'s Bucky\'s girlfriend.  Way to eschew traditional gender roles, pirates.    Yeah, they\'re fascinating   Now we melawan raja! And then we see who is bucktooth little shit! It\'ll still be you.  Listen    Melawaaaaaaan rajaaaaa! Mela wan, ra ja! Mela wan, ra ja! Hey, maybe there\'s a way to make some money on this.  Bet on me.  I would, but who\'d bet on    wait, don\'t you have that backwards? No.  Because you know what I bet?   I bet I kn you\'re gonna tell me   I bet after we Zodiac in past the reef, take out at least one O.  P. , make our way through a jungle full of Claymores, neutralize the fortress garrison, and finally extract that   kidnapped gettin ass sonuvabitch, he\'s gonna be all like      Woooooo! Wuhhhhh! Like this whole thing was all just part of some dumbshit master plan.  She said, trying to convince herself that she no longer ached for his    Oww! I\'m sorry, what were you gonna say? Cock.  Suck it! Cause I\'m still the king! This no fair! You break the rules! What rules?! We\'re pirates! Melawan raja mean hand hand combat! Boo hoo, show me! Show me where it says that! Take your time.  I\'m hourly.  I know it in here somewhere Damn! Okay, maybe it don\'t say this exact words, but everybody know    Nooop! Fair is    well it wasn\'t exactly fair, but since it wasn\'t expressly forbidden tough titties! Wow, I never realized how much we rely idioms.  You win this round, Archer! Duh.  But every dog has its day! See? Idiom.  And when that day come Bucky make you sorry!   Bucky make you say      Mayday mayday maydayThis is Rip Riley calling ISIS, over.  Noah.  That\'s not me.  I know that! Damn it, is that the P.  A. ?! Way to eschew traditional labeling, pirates.  Fascinating.  Because since when is there a radio in the damn dungeon?! God, you really shoulda read your orientation materials.  Noah! Radio room! Mayday mayday mayday, this is Rip Riley calling ISIS.  Mayday may    Rip?! Finally.  Malory, listen to me very    How\'s Sterling, is he hurt or    oh God, have the pirates tortured him?! Uh, no.  Oh thank God, I was    wait, are you under duress?! If you are, key your handset twice! I\'m not under duress, I\'m    Well, that\'s exactly what you\'d say if you were under duress, so    Malory! I don\'t have a lot of time, so please listen very carefully I\'m listening! Your son, is   Nooo! Oh my    Carol! Somebody?! What.  Sterling I think he\'s been shot! Oh my God.  So then can I go home? I told you, I\'m not going anywhere! Especially not back to ISIS, and especially not now that I just shot    What I assume was the only radio? Yeah, "See about getting a back up radio" was itemmmmm five.  And item one, is Riley get your ass back in your cell! Item one\'s actually the morale problem.  Noah? More like potential mutiny.  Yeah, right? Gonna go ahead and change "morale problem"   to "potential mutiny"   No! You\'re not!   Because there is no mutiny, potential or otherwi      Pemberontakan! Pemberontakan! So, is that Malay for    Mutiny, yes.    So I guess I should upgrade it from "potential" to      Incipient?   Ooh, nice   No! Do not upgrade that mutiny, Noah! I will tell you! When it\'s time! To upgrade the damn    Mutiny, okay, so What comes after incipient? In progress? Nailed it! Oh, this is great.  This is just great for my ears.  This is what I was talking about, with the whole tinnitis thing!   You hear that high pitched whine? It\'s like   Eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee! Noah! Aagh! What?! I    well for one thing, I\'m kinda regretting making you first mate! Me too! Now I\'m management! Archer! What?! Shut up! Noah! What?! What\'d you say about a back up radio?! That we need one! It\'s itemmmm Five! Oh well that\'s just   A battering ram? Archer! Kami membunuhmu! What was that, what\'d he say? "We\'re going to kill you. " Oh.  Thought they were surrendering.  Why?! Would you think that?! They did before! For no good reason! At least then we had assault weapons! Now we\'ve only got    give me that! Yeah go nuts, Sundance, it\'s empty.  It\'s empty! Because you emptied it! Into the only radio on the island!   All six, right in the ten ring   Well, congratulations! We\'re trapped! We\'re not    Trapped.  Okay yeah, we\'re trapped.  Uh, heah gang why don\'t we just use that? Well obviously we\'re gonna use that.  Hantu! They not ghosts! They just white! Rasis.  You\'re racist! Those dirty pirate bastards! They killed my baby boy hoy hooyyy!   Oh now, you don\'t know that for sure   You\'re right! That sound could\'ve been anything! Like a firecracker! Orientals are crazy for firecrackers! Oh my God, and rice? Or maybe Rip shot a pirate, and Sterling yelled "No" because he didn\'t want to give away their position! And opium.  Yes, you know, I bet they\'ve escaped! oh my God and rice.  Because if anyone can escape from a pirate fortress, it\'s Sterling and Rip.  Especially if they cooperate.  Damn it, quit stepping on my hands, you idiot! Quit bossing me around! You\'re not my    wait, tell me there\'s no chance you\'re my father.  Not unless you\'re    Fifteen.  Thank God.  The feeling\'s mutual.    Because if my son was as big a bonehead as you      You have a son? Wh ? No.  Then shut up.  Noah! Where the hell does this go?! I don\'t know, down!   Wow, you\'re only a doctoral candidate   Hey guy, my field\'s anthropology! Good luck with the job hunt.  Right? Not that it\'s any of your business, but I plan to teach?! Anthropology.  Wh ? Yes! To anthropology majors.  Hey ya know what? Thus continuing the circle of why bother.  Anthropology is an important field of study! I\'m pretty sure somebody\'s already named all the different spiders! Wh ? That\'s arachnology! I know! Equally huge waste of time! Hey speaking of, can we go back up? Oh my God.  Not really.  Why? Just curious.  Go go go go go! Waaaagh! Waaaagh! Oh, shi    That was just a flash bang grenade! Still super bad for your ears, So when we get outta here, you should go see my ENT doctor, he\'s good.  How the hell are we supposed to get out of here?! Isn\'t this your cell? Yes! So how\'d you get out before? I bribed Bucky! Noah! What? That is annoying as shit! And I doubt we can bribe Bucky again, since I crippled his girlfriend So what\'re we supposed to ow?! I dunno.  But I may as well go home and rest.  If they haven\'t escaped already, Lana will be there any time now, and she\'ll get them out.    And it\'s not like I can do anything from here   Exactly! So why do I have to stay?! Because Lana may call.  Or because I said so.  Pick one.  Who\'s jackin\' it? And why the hell are you still here? I, um, this is, uh, what was I doing? Whatever it was, you better pray it had about three coats of Scotch Gard.    And that it wasn\'t, ick, Pam   His narrow twinky ass better not steal the boat, is all I\'m saying Oh! And just, before we get in there, I am not still attracted to Archer! I\'m sure he\'s still attracted to me, I mean, he\'d have to be Uh, blind not to, um I am so sorry about that.  Does it hurt? Ray, seriously, I\'m sorry.  Oh, now you\'re giving me the silent treatment?! What\'re you, six?! No Just professional.    Hey, pirates   Okay, then how \'bout this? We set Noah on fire   What?    and when they come to put him out, we overpower them.  We don\'t have a lighter.  Well, then, I\'m out of ideas.  And also, out of luck.  Because no rescue for you, hotshot.    We catch your friends on beachy.    But Ray? Holy shit, wheredcha get that eye patch? What are you, in pirate disguise? Great job, buddy.  Looks great.  Lana? You came all this way? To rescue me? Oh, my God.  Archer, don\'t.  Still got it pretty bad for me, huh? Archer   Archer Archer, don\'t you dare say   Whoo! What do you mean "Lana hasn\'t called"? I mean, I\'ve been sitting here for like five million years, and the phone hasn\'t rung once, and so every time it doesn\'t, I just assume it\'s not her, not calling to say they They should\'ve rescued Sterling and Rip from the pirates hours ago!   Maybe they did and just didn\'t call   No, I gave them explicit orders to What the hell are you wearing? Uh, this thing cal cd my boss made me sleep at my desk, so pajamas? Men\'s pajamas? For God\'s sake woman, where is your pride? In my work.  That may be the funniest thing you\'ve ever said.  Thank you.  Oh shut up.  And then try Lana\'s sat phone! Wait, what if Lana\'s been captured, too? Then I\'ll have to ransom her and Sterling and Rip and, well no, Miss Gillette\'s on her own.  Still, get Cyril in here! I need him to find a way to pay for all this! Wait a minute, that can\'t be right I remember being really mad and really drunk and deciding to do some online Banking! Oh my God, I must have embezz, arrassed myself last night, huh? Don\'t talk like black people, and how should I know? I\'m still ripped.  So, you don\'t, um, happen to remember me saying anything about passwords to say, Swiss bank accounts? I don\'t even remember who peed on your sofa.    Although, if I was a gamblin\' man   Cyril! What! Ugh, smells like a kennel in here.  Cash reserves, how much do we have?   I\'ll, uh, need to run those numbers   Well hurry up, we don\'t have a minute to lose! God only knows what kind of torture Sterling\'s going through.  Get off the bucket.  I\'m not done.  Yes, you are.  But I didn\'t, you know, I can\'t with all the everybody looking at me, and then the judgements.  Noah? Yes? I just traveled eight thousand miles and got ambushed by Malaysian pirates trying to rescue a person who is now responsible for my getting crabs twice? Oh come on, These crabs, this time, were not my fault.    This whole dungeon is, um   Were you gonna say "lousy with them"?   I was, but then I realized that\'s   Where that phrase comes from, yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So Guess what I\'m in.  No mood? Winner winner, chicken dinner.  Wait, shouldn\'t it be some kinda crab dish? Because of the crabs? Like crabcakes? Ooh, or Lana.  Lana.  Lana.  Lanaaahhhhh! What? Dugenon us crabs.  Cause we\'re in a dungeon.  I\'m kidding, crab rangoon.  Noah, seriously, I swear to God Stop.  Rock beats spoon, you should know that, you\'re an archaeologist.  Ann! Thropologist! I mean if you\'re doing it just to get on my nerves, okay I get it,   but if you\'re trying to actually escape   Well at least he\'s trying something.    As opposed to the doublemint twins   Meh! And it\'s one, two, three, go Herd!   Missed it by that much   Shut up.  It\'s no use.  That trap door goes up a vertical shaft to the radio room   Exactly, and if we get to the radio   Which this idiot shot to piece Holy shit.  Wh ? What the hell happened to him?!   He   Who knows?! Maybe a brain aneurysm! No, he It\'s the silent killer! Noah! Not unlike a metal spoon.  Sharpened to a razor\'s edge and used to slit an anthropologist\'s birdlike throat.    He just kinda keeled over   Probably thanks to your bucket stankch.    Wh ? I didn\'t even go! We\'re going, one, two, three, down Herd! Oof! Jeez, how bout a little warning?! I said "Down Herd. " Couple things, one, Ray, thanks for perpetuating the stereotype of the gay man as collegiate cheerleader For your information, almost all male cheerleaders are   Finely tuned heteroathletes, yeah, hang on, I\'m getting a call.  Brrnng, hello? Hi, it\'s lacrosse, you lose.  Lacrosse?! Yeah, it\'s Algonquin for bloodsport? That\'s not Algonquin for anything.  Noah?   My sat phone! Yeah, Noah, her, wait, your what?   My sat phone! The pirates took it! And since I haven\'t called in, ISIS should be calling me any time now! Jeezow Lana, answer your stupid phone.  Hello?! Gimme Sterleen Archer mudda! Oh my God be more Chinesey.  Pirates, line two!   Wh ? Well for    put them through! Oh my God be more I hate you.  That\'s why your phone is blinking! Oh.  Hello?   This is Malory Archer   This is Malory Archer Okay, den you lissen to me! No, you just listen to me, buster! Bucky! If you touch one hair on my son\'s head, I\'ll have your guts for garters! You like wear garter?   Wh ? It\'s an idiom! You heathen! Malory will call, she\'ll haggle over the ransom for me, you and Riley.  What about me? And me?   We\'ll come back for you later   No, shut up, we gotta get that phone, or something, I don\'t know, but I don\'t want Mother talking to Bucky! Why not? She\'s been coming to your rescue since you were in short pants! Rr.  Rr.  Rrr! Oh for, Sterling get your things.  We\'re leaving.  Before this quack\'s office burns to the ground.  Rr.  Rr.  Rrr! Sterling get your things.  We\'re leaving.  Before this cruddy school burns to the ground.  Rr.  Rr.  Rrr! Sterling get your things! He\'s gay.  You were in the army? Oh, who remembers.  Well, try! I can\'t! Remember! There\'s a reason they call it "black out drunk!" If I don\'t remember that password I can\'t unembezzle that money, and then I\'m screwed because I don\'t have   Ten million dollars? That\'s outrageous, I won\'t pay it, I don\'t even want the gay back.  So you better just sharpen your pencil.    I don\'t have penc   It\'s an idiom! Aw, but I love it when Malory bails you out of one of your idiot jams.  Oh really.  Yeah, \'cause then I get to watch her rub it in your face.    Oh my God, okay first of all      First of all!   Wh ?! Riley no! Don\'t say it! He\'s been here voluntarily! Partying his ass off, as king of the pirates! What? Don\'t listen to him, I bet that brain aneurysm scrambled les Broca\'s area.  Language center of the brain? Noah.  Thank you.  No problem.  Actually not making much progress.  You\'re kidding.  No.  Three million, and not a penny more.  And before you see one thin dime, I want to talk to Sterling! Cyril! Waagh!   Hey, Ms.  Archer   Three million in cash? That, uh, should not be a problem.  I know it shouldn\'t be.  And it better not be.  Why would it be, it\'s not, I just need to move a little money around.  So move it.  Today please! Keep looking, maybe I wrote it down! Archersucks, no.  Killarcherdie, no.    Uh   Just trying all my usual passwords.  Hey, way to not give him the power.  Thank you.  Do you hear me? I want proof of life! Duh.    You lying pathetic little piece of      Hooof! Lana no! C\'mon, you\'re gonna kill him! Yeah, that\'s the plan! Hey! Knock it off! Look, Lana, don\'t get me wrong, I like your spunk      Phrasing.  Shut up, but I promised his mother I\'d bring him home safely, and I just assume that includes his spleen.    Think that ship might\'ve sailed   No, not a ship      That was an idiom.  A helicopter.  There\'s an old Huey down by the dock, and it just so happens Rip Riley here can fly it.  No shit.  Yeah Rip Riley here can fly anything.  You know, as long as it\'s got fuel.  Well, Rip, why don\'t we just look around for some fuel in this cell   Doubt they\'d keep it in here.    In which! We\'re still locked! I figured we\'d kinda work backwards.  From the stealing of the helicopter.  Archerstabface, no.  Archerbortion      No! What\'re you, gonna type random words in there the rest of your life? All five minutes of it! At which point Ms.  Archer will probably walk in here and dissolve me in a drum of acid, unless you have a better idea.    State dependent memory!   So, your plan is for us to get as black out, knee walking, shitfaced drunk as we were last night, in the hopes that we remember the password.  Well don\'t hog it all! Pam! Ugh, seriously, I bet that would\'ve killed a lesser man.  There\'s a lesser man than you? Uh yeah, his name\'s Houdini?   Whom I wish you were      Yeah, cause then I   could just puke up a key   Because you\'d be dead.  Houdini\'s dead? You know what? Yes.  Here\'s what we do, we lure Bucky down here, and take him hostage.  And then? Then we\'ll see.  We\'ll keep it loose.  Oh for, and just how the hell are we supposed to lure him down here?! Sterling Archer? What\'s that? Sorry, I couldn\'t hear you over the sound of my plan working.  Telephone! It\'s you mudda!   My    Wait, please tell me you didn\'t tell her I was temporarily the pirapi king.  No not yet, but this is damn good I Nnngh! Sterling?! Sterling are you alright?! No Mother, I\'m a captive of pirates! Oh, and Riley said he no longer finds you attractive \'cause you\'re too old! He what?! What?! You little Sunamabeetch! Grrk! Was that a gunshot?!   Yep, they got ol\' Ray this time   Raayyy! And now I keel you! Rrrgh! Right in my same ear! Ha! Good, serves you right!   Malory, I never said   You\'re no spring chicken yourself, you know! Rrrnh! Lanaahh! Is Lana hit?! Someone talk to me! Mother, I\'m a little busy right now.  Noah! What?! Spoon him! You mean spoon him as in like oh! Today please! I am incredibly sorry.  Grrk! Rip?! Rip I take it all back, you\'re as strong and sexy as the night we     For shit\'s sake, Mother! How short is the list of guys you haven\'t screwed?! Oh, how dare you? You can forget about that ransom! For once you\'re on your own!   For once? Oh my God, Columbia Hou    All I wanted! Was to mourn! The murder of my crazy hot Russian fiance by becoming a pirate king! But I guess that was too much to ask! So Mother can keep her stupid ransom, because I don\'t need her! What I do need, is some frickin crab shampoo! Noah! Wounded!   No, I\'m    well, maybe some psychic scarring, but physically I\'m      Tend! To the wounded! Oh, right.  Not him! Start with Lana! I\'m fine! Check on Ray! Yeah, he is not looking good.  Although, neither is Riley and neither is your situation! Because you can forget ransom! Now you and your friends will die here! Yeah, speaking of forgetting, couple things.  One, these aren\'t my friends.    Got that right   I mean her, yes, kinda, maybe,   but there\'s a lotta weird sexual tension   Ha! But these other three, whatever, who cares, I mean Noah\'s a slave.    Yeah, about that     Noah not now! And two   Aha, but I shoot gun many times! And in all the excitement I lose track myself! So now you thinking, did he fire eight shots or only   Four.  Idiot.  So get your things, we\'re leaving.  Hey, can I run up to my hovel and grab the only extant copy of my dissertation? Noah? Still got four bullets.  Do you know what "extant" means? You know what "license to kill" means? I\'ll just um write another one.  The world holds its breath.  Ray?! Ray, c\'mon honey, stay with me! Ray.  Ray! Ray!!   Not sure that\'s helping!   Yeah neither are you! Lana, I only have two hands.  What I don\'t have, is all day! There, I finished! Jeez damn! How ya doin, Riley? How the hell do you think I\'m doing?! Hey relax, Nick Furious! Save your strength for flying the chopper.  And again, I am just incredibly sorry.  What\'s your blood type? How would I know?   Wh ? How would you not?! Who am I, Karl Landsteiner? Discoverer of blood groups? You don\'t know your own blood type, but you know who discovered them.  Yeah, now Your exact words, Pam! "Dr.  Charles Drew, or I will eat a bag of dicks!" Bring \'em.  And not to diminish the accomplishments of Dr.  Charles Drew, but God damn it Archer! Ray needs O positive blood, or he is gonna die! So give him some of yours!   I\'m A negative! Hey, me too!   And even if Riley\'s O positive   No, I\'m A negative too.  He\'s already a quart low.    Sooo   Oh.  Positive? Yeah.  One of these days, I swear to God, I am going to burn this place straight down to the ground.  Oh my God yes, hey, what about this Sunday?! Unless you want people in here, in which case weeohh my God! Waagh! Five oh, five oh! Cyril! Never mind moving that money.  What money, oh! Really? You sure?   Because all I need to do is just   Re evaluate your entire life, and yes, I\'m sure.  Sterling can get himself out of this jam.  For once.  Oh and don\'t be here on Sunday.  Pam.  Why just me, what\'s happenin\' Sunday? Probably my grisly murder, since we still haven\'t found that password! Ya try "guest"?   No Pam, I didn\'t, because I\'m not an      Oh, eat a dick.  Bring it.  How much of my blood does he need?! I dunno, ten gills.    Wh ?! U. S.  or imperial?!   Just keep sqinueezing that gag ball.  That I don\'t wanna know why you have.  No, you do not.  You will never make it to helicopter! My men will cut you down like dogs! Thanks, human shield.  Although Where the hell are all your men? Wh ? Are you serious? They\'re all at the intramural lacrosse finals.  The what?! Oww! Lana shut up.  That\'s today?! It\'s right now.  Well, in ten minutes.    Who\'s playing?!   Archer.    Uh, the Lax mi Singhers   They made the finals?! Versus the Archers of Loafcrosse.    Wh ?! That\'s my team! Archer.  Lana, I\'m team captain! I built that team from nothing, and now      Archer! Ray is dying.  Does that mean so must my dream?! Look, I think it\'s great that for once you\'re getting out of a jam without your mother\'s help, but      Not for once! Hello? Columbia House? But remember earlier, when you said that you and I were friends? I, of course.  I mean I know we fight a lot, but God, now that I think about it, you\'re my only friend.  Wow.  Right?   Yes, Archer, because if you do this   Please don\'t make me choose.  I will never, ever forgive you, and we will never, ever be friends again.  Woooo! Birds eye view of lacrosse! Lana, Lana, we got the face off!   Hooray!   Now can we please get out of here?! Because we are totally vulnerable! I know, look at our defenders! He\'s not talking about the defenders.  The crease, idiots! Guard the crease! And what are my middies doing? Middies! C\'mon, get in position! Oh shit, they are!   No look, they\'re all bunched    oh.  Iiiiincomiiiiiing! Eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee!   Hooray!   Wait wait wait, Lana    Get some! Get some! You sons of bitches! Suck it! Nooooooo! Hang on! Lanaaaaa! Archerrrrr! What, Lana! I Nothing, I got you.  You got me! Well that\'s just super! What the hell is your problem?! My problem! Is you just Bonnie and Clyded my starting middies!   Wh ?   They were Red shirt freshmen, Lana! Who I was grooming! But now I guess the Archers of Loafcrosse can forget about the South Pacific lacrosse championships! Yeah that\'s not a thing.  If and when that becomes a thing! Here\'s a thing.  Your mother doesn\'t know you ran away to be a pirate, so   No!   Lana, seriously, she   Would literally kill you.  Well, figurative yeah, literally.  So now, for the rest of your idiot life, I\'m got that on you.  Wow.  Right? Oh my God! Just screw already! Seriously.  Then kill each other.  Then shut up.  And then kill each other again.  And call me, so I can watch you do it.  Sterling, I don\'t know how you did it, but, well, except for Rip\'s eye you got everyone home in one piece.  No thanks to you.  Well, it\'s about time to did something on your own.  Oh for Columbia House! Record Club! Archer! The important thing is we\'re home.  And that we spare Malory the details of your time on pirate island.  Why, what happened? Nothing! Well, you know, besides a lot of um, pretty horrific torture.  Which mother, if you had seen would have broken your heart.  But why dwell on that? We\'re home!   And my mourning period, for um   Katya.  Is over, so hey! It\'s a happy ending! Yeah, it\'s just a big ol\' goddamn fairy tale.  Fairy tale.  Uh, phrasing? Ray, I\'m kidding! Don\'t be like that! Oh, gross keep it moving, cripple! Shut up.  Ray? Ray.  Ray! Oh, okay! Then I guess just pout!Aw c\'maaaahn! Clock yer skinny ass out already, and let\'s go get outside some dranks! Ugh, I can\'t! I have to cover her stupid phone in case those stupid pirates call with a stupid ransom demand for Mr.  Stupid Archer! Carol?! Carol! Have they called?! No! Ma\'am! But rest assured I\'ll let you know the minute they dooo! Rest?   My God, who can rest   Not me, apparently.  Or me! I have to re do the annual budget because she\'s blowing it all on this so called rescue of Archer! Well his plane did crash, and the distress signal was last heard coming from a known pirate fortress, so   So?! That doesn\'t mean Ray and Lana have to bankrupt ISIS getting there! Oh, would you relax? You rent a boat, that money\'s gone.  This way, we can sell it when we\'re done.  I bet it\'ll come out cheaper.  I wasn\'t talking about the boat.  I think five grand for the week was a steal.  Look at him, he is lithe.  So a twink escort your rent, but    That\'s different! I mean, they did ask if I wanted to actually buy him, but I thought What, that I\'d be weird about it? That I, perhaps due to my race, might have a problem with the concept of owning a human being? I actually just thought I\'d get tired of him.  You? Mr.  Can\'t Even Commit To A Pet? Wh ? Yeah hi, two cats! One of whom I think has FIP, so commit that.  You know how hard I worked on this budget?! Nights, weekends, canceled my vacation, and now it\'s all wasted! Wasted, exactly, let\'s go be that! C\'mon, happy hour at Pita Margarita\'s! Is that what it sounds like? Only if it sounds like a shitload of tequila and some A rab hoagies.  How dare you?! Arab, sorry.  Oh shut up, how can you even think about happy hour at a time like this?! When probably as we speak, my poor Sterling is being tortured by pirates! I wish What?! Wish you wouldn\'t say that!   Because I\'m sure he\'s not being tortured   Aaaaaaaaaaaagghhhhhhh! Ohhhh my God, stop, stop, stop, seriously I can\'t take anymore! Whew! That was insane, I never even heard of that position! Did the missionaries not swing by here, or? Excuse me? Sorry, pirate king Archer? What! Noah! Ready for the uh, morning briefing? Noah, I\'m half drunk and slathered in every bodily fluid there is.  So yeah, this is about as piratekingy as I\'m gonna get.  Brief away! Okay, item one! The    Noah.  Yes sir? Good morning.  O. K.  Item one.  The huge morale problem.  How do we have a morale problem? Well first of all    C\'mon, karaoke night\'s a big hit Roti dan mentega, bakar dan selai! Woooo! We have an awesome feast every night Woooo! Not to mention intramural lacrosse! Woooo! Woooo! Woooo! So how can they have low morale? Well um, besides all of those things, they haven\'t been paid.  So pay \'em, what do you need, new payroll software? Cyril always handled all that stuff.    Payroll, budgets, he\'s a genius at that crap   Just find the money, Cyril! You\'re an accounting genius, Cyril! That\'s right you bitch.  I said it.  So good luck finding all these Swiss accounts! Mwah ha! Mwah ha ha ha ha haaaaaa! Whatcha doin? Aagh!   Hey, Pam  No, we don\'t need      Oh! And dealing with   disgruntled employees, Pam\'s great at that   Izzat innernet porn? Uh, yep! Just, um just jackin it.  Can I watch? Or izzat weird? It\'s kinda weird.  Is it? Yes.  I think it\'s because she\'s such a good listener.  And she sounds lovely.    But you don\'t need an HR rep and payroll software      Couldn\'t hurt Sir! Please! Pirates work for shares, and since you became pirateking there hasn\'t been any booty, so    Gonna have to go ahead and disagree with you there, buddy.  From pirated ships.  Oh.  I thought you meant from the    Native girls, no.  Sorry, I don\'t know all the pirate terms yet.  Well    I\'m new! To all of this! Especially the actual, you know, piracy part It\'s not really what I expected.  Dammit, I said get over there! For the jillionth time, nobody is raping anybody! Actually no, you know what?! Now nobody gets anything, because I\'m letting him go! Shut up! He\'s a small business owner! If he loses his ship he\'ll be ruined! You can go.  Ooh, but can we get about fifty pounds of tuna steaks? Which you let him talk you down to twenty.  Well?! You know what kinda margins those guys work on?   I actually don\'t   Well nice Ph. D. ! My field\'s anthropology.  And I\'m actually just a doctoral candidate? Or I was, until these guys captured my research vessel and enslaved me   Ugh, not this again   So I was thinking, if you freed me You\'re my translator, I need you.  That\'s why I made you first mate.  Which also went over pretty badly.  Yeah, people hate you so let\'s just put a pin in the whole manumission thing.  But    Noah! Morale\'s low enough as it is.  And I bet I know who\'s to blame! No kidding I\'m not kidding, this Archer guy\'s gonna get you all killed.  He    Riley! Archer, what a coincidence.  I was just talking about you.  With who? Cause that bucktooth little shit doesn\'t even speak English! I do little bit    No you don\'t.     and correct syntax is "with whom!" Man, that is not gonna help morale.  Yeah, Bucky\'s an incorrigible gossip.  Who    to whom you are forbidden to speak! I locked you down here so you couldn\'t contact my mother, not so you could, whatever, sow disharmony! You\'re sowing plenty all by yourself.  Face it kid, you\'re a bust as a pirateking.  King, exactly! And unless you want to spend the rest of the afternoon with a bunch of scorpions, don\'t forget it! And remember, this is a rescue mission.  I heard you.  So don\'t charge in there all crazy, machine gunning everything in sight.  When have I    I\'m sure you\'d love it   if Sterling were killed in some huge crossfire.    Wh ? No I wouldn\'t!    but just try to control all your jealousy and, ick, sexual frustration.  Oh no, you\'re breaking up.  Lana.  I mean, am I jealous because Archer gets preferential treatment? Yes.  But am I still attracted to him? Is a pig\'s ass pork? I\'m sorry, did you wanna hear what I think, or just what you wanna hear? He asked, pretty sarcastically.  Raja lemah! Raja lemah! Kita memerlukan raja baru! Whoa whoa! Bucky! What is this?! We hold erections for king!   Well, flattering, not really necessary   He means elections.  Okay, that makes more    wait, what?! Time for new king! Raja baru! Okay, pirates! Hey! Take a knee! Noah You wanna? That won\'t translate.  It\'s like last week when you said "lend me your ears" and they were like "Apa?" Damn it    I can\'t do idioms.  Shut up.    Then unshut up, and tell them I understand their frustration   Do you? Saya mendengar anda! But you don\'t change horses in mid    Idiom! Now is not the time for a new king! Sekarang tidak ada raja baru! Because the king is strong! Raja yang kuat! If you so strong melawan raja! Yah! Melawan raja! Melawan raja! What\'s melawan raja? King fight.  If the king loses to a challenger in one on one combat, he has to step down.  Or just be dead.  Since when?! Since 19 always.  Did you not read the orientation materials? Woooo! Mmmmore skimmed it? Enough talk! Melawan raja!   Okay Bucky, we\'ll melawan raja   Oh, one thing    Noah shut up and translate.  I accept your challenge! Cabaran diterima! Because your mouth\'s been writing checks your butt can\'t cash, Anda    Do you even know what an idiom is? Colloquial metaphor.  No, it\'s    well actually yes, but I really think this is a bad idea    I\'m not remunerating you to think, Noah! Even if you weren\'t a slave.  And your three fifths of an opinion is noted, so    oh sweet Jesus Jones! See, Bucky doesn\'t have to fight you himself.  He can choose a stand in.  Who is huge! That\'s what I was    Why didn\'t he come out for lacrosse?! You lucky I don\'t let him! Let him? He\'s Bucky\'s girlfriend.  Way to eschew traditional gender roles, pirates.    Yeah, they\'re fascinating   Now we melawan raja! And then we see who is bucktooth little shit! It\'ll still be you.  Listen    Melawaaaaaaan rajaaaaa! Mela wan, ra ja! Mela wan, ra ja! Hey, maybe there\'s a way to make some money on this.  Bet on me.  I would, but who\'d bet on    wait, don\'t you have that backwards? No.  Because you know what I bet?   I bet I kn you\'re gonna tell me   I bet after we Zodiac in past the reef, take out at least one O.  P. , make our way through a jungle full of Claymores, neutralize the fortress garrison, and finally extract that   kidnapped gettin ass sonuvabitch, he\'s gonna be all like      Woooooo! Wuhhhhh! Like this whole thing was all just part of some dumbshit master plan.  She said, trying to convince herself that she no longer ached for his    Oww! I\'m sorry, what were you gonna say? Cock.  Suck it! Cause I\'m still the king! This no fair! You break the rules! What rules?! We\'re pirates! Melawan raja mean hand hand combat! Boo hoo, show me! Show me where it says that! Take your time.  I\'m hourly.  I know it in here somewhere Damn! Okay, maybe it don\'t say this exact words, but everybody know    Nooop! Fair is    well it wasn\'t exactly fair, but since it wasn\'t expressly forbidden tough titties! Wow, I never realized how much we rely idioms.  You win this round, Archer! Duh.  But every dog has its day! See? Idiom.  And when that day come Bucky make you sorry!   Bucky make you say      Mayday mayday maydayThis is Rip Riley calling ISIS, over.  Noah.  That\'s not me.  I know that! Damn it, is that the P.  A. ?! Way to eschew traditional labeling, pirates.  Fascinating.  Because since when is there a radio in the damn dungeon?! God, you really shoulda read your orientation materials.  Noah! Radio room! Mayday mayday mayday, this is Rip Riley calling ISIS.  Mayday may    Rip?! Finally.  Malory, listen to me very    How\'s Sterling, is he hurt or    oh God, have the pirates tortured him?! Uh, no.  Oh thank God, I was    wait, are you under duress?! If you are, key your handset twice! I\'m not under duress, I\'m    Well, that\'s exactly what you\'d say if you were under duress, so    Malory! I don\'t have a lot of time, so please listen very carefully I\'m listening! Your son, is   Nooo! Oh my    Carol! Somebody?! What.  Sterling I think he\'s been shot! Oh my God.  So then can I go home? I told you, I\'m not going anywhere! Especially not back to ISIS, and especially not now that I just shot    What I assume was the only radio? Yeah, "See about getting a back up radio" was itemmmmm five.  And item one, is Riley get your ass back in your cell! Item one\'s actually the morale problem.  Noah? More like potential mutiny.  Yeah, right? Gonna go ahead and change "morale problem"   to "potential mutiny"   No! You\'re not!   Because there is no mutiny, potential or otherwi      Pemberontakan! Pemberontakan! So, is that Malay for    Mutiny, yes.    So I guess I should upgrade it from "potential" to      Incipient?   Ooh, nice   No! Do not upgrade that mutiny, Noah! I will tell you! When it\'s time! To upgrade the damn    Mutiny, okay, so What comes after incipient? In progress? Nailed it! Oh, this is great.  This is just great for my ears.  This is what I was talking about, with the whole tinnitis thing!   You hear that high pitched whine? It\'s like   Eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee! Noah! Aagh! What?! I    well for one thing, I\'m kinda regretting making you first mate! Me too! Now I\'m management! Archer! What?! Shut up! Noah! What?! What\'d you say about a back up radio?! That we need one! It\'s itemmmm Five! Oh well that\'s just   A battering ram? Archer! Kami membunuhmu! What was that, what\'d he say? "We\'re going to kill you. " Oh.  Thought they were surrendering.  Why?! Would you think that?! They did before! For no good reason! At least then we had assault weapons! Now we\'ve only got    give me that! Yeah go nuts, Sundance, it\'s empty.  It\'s empty! Because you emptied it! Into the only radio on the island!   All six, right in the ten ring   Well, congratulations! We\'re trapped! We\'re not    Trapped.  Okay yeah, we\'re trapped.  Uh, heah gang why don\'t we just use that? Well obviously we\'re gonna use that.  Hantu! They not ghosts! They just white! Rasis.  You\'re racist! Those dirty pirate bastards! They killed my baby boy hoy hooyyy!   Oh now, you don\'t know that for sure   You\'re right! That sound could\'ve been anything! Like a firecracker! Orientals are crazy for firecrackers! Oh my God, and rice? Or maybe Rip shot a pirate, and Sterling yelled "No" because he didn\'t want to give away their position! And opium.  Yes, you know, I bet they\'ve escaped! oh my God and rice.  Because if anyone can escape from a pirate fortress, it\'s Sterling and Rip.  Especially if they cooperate.  Damn it, quit stepping on my hands, you idiot! Quit bossing me around! You\'re not my    wait, tell me there\'s no chance you\'re my father.  Not unless you\'re    Fifteen.  Thank God.  The feeling\'s mutual.    Because if my son was as big a bonehead as you      You have a son? Wh ? No.  Then shut up.  Noah! Where the hell does this go?! I don\'t know, down!   Wow, you\'re only a doctoral candidate   Hey guy, my field\'s anthropology! Good luck with the job hunt.  Right? Not that it\'s any of your business, but I plan to teach?! Anthropology.  Wh ? Yes! To anthropology majors.  Hey ya know what? Thus continuing the circle of why bother.  Anthropology is an important field of study! I\'m pretty sure somebody\'s already named all the different spiders! Wh ? That\'s arachnology! I know! Equally huge waste of time! Hey speaking of, can we go back up? Oh my God.  Not really.  Why? Just curious.  Go go go go go! Waaaagh! Waaaagh! Oh, shi    That was just a flash bang grenade! Still super bad for your ears, So when we get outta here, you should go see my ENT doctor, he\'s good.  How the hell are we supposed to get out of here?! Isn\'t this your cell? Yes! So how\'d you get out before? I bribed Bucky! Noah! What? That is annoying as shit! And I doubt we can bribe Bucky again, since I crippled his girlfriend So what\'re we supposed to ow?! I dunno.  But I may as well go home and rest.  If they haven\'t escaped already, Lana will be there any time now, and she\'ll get them out.    And it\'s not like I can do anything from here   Exactly! So why do I have to stay?! Because Lana may call.  Or because I said so.  Pick one.  Who\'s jackin\' it? And why the hell are you still here? I, um, this is, uh, what was I doing? Whatever it was, you better pray it had about three coats of Scotch Gard.    And that it wasn\'t, ick, Pam   His narrow twinky ass better not steal the boat, is all I\'m saying Oh! And just, before we get in there, I am not still attracted to Archer! I\'m sure he\'s still attracted to me, I mean, he\'d have to be Uh, blind not to, um I am so sorry about that.  Does it hurt? Ray, seriously, I\'m sorry.  Oh, now you\'re giving me the silent treatment?! What\'re you, six?! No Just professional.    Hey, pirates   Okay, then how \'bout this? We set Noah on fire   What?    and when they come to put him out, we overpower them.  We don\'t have a lighter.  Well, then, I\'m out of ideas.  And also, out of luck.  Because no rescue for you, hotshot.    We catch your friends on beachy.    But Ray? Holy shit, wheredcha get that eye patch? What are you, in pirate disguise? Great job, buddy.  Looks great.  Lana? You came all this way? To rescue me? Oh, my God.  Archer, don\'t.  Still got it pretty bad for me, huh? Archer   Archer Archer, don\'t you dare say   Whoo!What do you mean "Lana hasn\'t called"? I mean, I\'ve been sitting here for like five million years, and the phone hasn\'t rung once, and so every time it doesn\'t, I just assume it\'s not her, not calling to say they They should\'ve rescued Sterling and Rip from the pirates hours ago!   Maybe they did and just didn\'t call   No, I gave them explicit orders to What the hell are you wearing? Uh, this thing cal cd my boss made me sleep at my desk, so pajamas? Men\'s pajamas? For God\'s sake woman, where is your pride? In my work.  That may be the funniest thing you\'ve ever said.  Thank you.  Oh shut up.  And then try Lana\'s sat phone! Wait, what if Lana\'s been captured, too? Then I\'ll have to ransom her and Sterling and Rip and, well no, Miss Gillette\'s on her own.  Still, get Cyril in here! I need him to find a way to pay for all this! Wait a minute, that can\'t be right I remember being really mad and really drunk and deciding to do some online Banking! Oh my God, I must have embezz, arrassed myself last night, huh? Don\'t talk like black people, and how should I know? I\'m still ripped.  So, you don\'t, um, happen to remember me saying anything about passwords to say, Swiss bank accounts? I don\'t even remember who peed on your sofa.    Although, if I was a gamblin\' man   Cyril! What! Ugh, smells like a kennel in here.  Cash reserves, how much do we have?   I\'ll, uh, need to run those numbers   Well hurry up, we don\'t have a minute to lose! God only knows what kind of torture Sterling\'s going through.  Get off the bucket.  I\'m not done.  Yes, you are.  But I didn\'t, you know, I can\'t with all the everybody looking at me, and then the judgements.  Noah? Yes? I just traveled eight thousand miles and got ambushed by Malaysian pirates trying to rescue a person who is now responsible for my getting crabs twice? Oh come on, These crabs, this time, were not my fault.    This whole dungeon is, um   Were you gonna say "lousy with them"?   I was, but then I realized that\'s   Where that phrase comes from, yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So Guess what I\'m in.  No mood? Winner winner, chicken dinner.  Wait, shouldn\'t it be some kinda crab dish? Because of the crabs? Like crabcakes? Ooh, or Lana.  Lana.  Lana.  Lanaaahhhhh! What? Dugenon us crabs.  Cause we\'re in a dungeon.  I\'m kidding, crab rangoon.  Noah, seriously, I swear to God Stop.  Rock beats spoon, you should know that, you\'re an archaeologist.  Ann! Thropologist! I mean if you\'re doing it just to get on my nerves, okay I get it,   but if you\'re trying to actually escape   Well at least he\'s trying something.    As opposed to the doublemint twins   Meh! And it\'s one, two, three, go Herd!   Missed it by that much   Shut up.  It\'s no use.  That trap door goes up a vertical shaft to the radio room   Exactly, and if we get to the radio   Which this idiot shot to piece Holy shit.  Wh ? What the hell happened to him?!   He   Who knows?! Maybe a brain aneurysm! No, he It\'s the silent killer! Noah! Not unlike a metal spoon.  Sharpened to a razor\'s edge and used to slit an anthropologist\'s birdlike throat.    He just kinda keeled over   Probably thanks to your bucket stankch.    Wh ? I didn\'t even go! We\'re going, one, two, three, down Herd! Oof! Jeez, how bout a little warning?! I said "Down Herd. " Couple things, one, Ray, thanks for perpetuating the stereotype of the gay man as collegiate cheerleader For your information, almost all male cheerleaders are   Finely tuned heteroathletes, yeah, hang on, I\'m getting a call.  Brrnng, hello? Hi, it\'s lacrosse, you lose.  Lacrosse?! Yeah, it\'s Algonquin for bloodsport? That\'s not Algonquin for anything.  Noah?   My sat phone! Yeah, Noah, her, wait, your what?   My sat phone! The pirates took it! And since I haven\'t called in, ISIS should be calling me any time now! Jeezow Lana, answer your stupid phone.  Hello?! Gimme Sterleen Archer mudda! Oh my God be more Chinesey.  Pirates, line two!   Wh ? Well for    put them through! Oh my God be more I hate you.  That\'s why your phone is blinking! Oh.  Hello?   This is Malory Archer   This is Malory Archer Okay, den you lissen to me! No, you just listen to me, buster! Bucky! If you touch one hair on my son\'s head, I\'ll have your guts for garters! You like wear garter?   Wh ? It\'s an idiom! You heathen! Malory will call, she\'ll haggle over the ransom for me, you and Riley.  What about me? And me?   We\'ll come back for you later   No, shut up, we gotta get that phone, or something, I don\'t know, but I don\'t want Mother talking to Bucky! Why not? She\'s been coming to your rescue since you were in short pants! Rr.  Rr.  Rrr! Oh for, Sterling get your things.  We\'re leaving.  Before this quack\'s office burns to the ground.  Rr.  Rr.  Rrr! Sterling get your things.  We\'re leaving.  Before this cruddy school burns to the ground.  Rr.  Rr.  Rrr! Sterling get your things! He\'s gay.  You were in the army? Oh, who remembers.  Well, try! I can\'t! Remember! There\'s a reason they call it "black out drunk!" If I don\'t remember that password I can\'t unembezzle that money, and then I\'m screwed because I don\'t have   Ten million dollars? That\'s outrageous, I won\'t pay it, I don\'t even want the gay back.  So you better just sharpen your pencil.    I don\'t have penc   It\'s an idiom! Aw, but I love it when Malory bails you out of one of your idiot jams.  Oh really.  Yeah, \'cause then I get to watch her rub it in your face.    Oh my God, okay first of all      First of all!   Wh ?! Riley no! Don\'t say it! He\'s been here voluntarily! Partying his ass off, as king of the pirates! What? Don\'t listen to him, I bet that brain aneurysm scrambled les Broca\'s area.  Language center of the brain? Noah.  Thank you.  No problem.  Actually not making much progress.  You\'re kidding.  No.  Three million, and not a penny more.  And before you see one thin dime, I want to talk to Sterling! Cyril! Waagh!   Hey, Ms.  Archer   Three million in cash? That, uh, should not be a problem.  I know it shouldn\'t be.  And it better not be.  Why would it be, it\'s not, I just need to move a little money around.  So move it.  Today please! Keep looking, maybe I wrote it down! Archersucks, no.  Killarcherdie, no.    Uh   Just trying all my usual passwords.  Hey, way to not give him the power.  Thank you.  Do you hear me? I want proof of life! Duh.    You lying pathetic little piece of      Hooof! Lana no! C\'mon, you\'re gonna kill him! Yeah, that\'s the plan! Hey! Knock it off! Look, Lana, don\'t get me wrong, I like your spunk      Phrasing.  Shut up, but I promised his mother I\'d bring him home safely, and I just assume that includes his spleen.    Think that ship might\'ve sailed   No, not a ship      That was an idiom.  A helicopter.  There\'s an old Huey down by the dock, and it just so happens Rip Riley here can fly it.  No shit.  Yeah Rip Riley here can fly anything.  You know, as long as it\'s got fuel.  Well, Rip, why don\'t we just look around for some fuel in this cell   Doubt they\'d keep it in here.    In which! We\'re still locked! I figured we\'d kinda work backwards.  From the stealing of the helicopter.  Archerstabface, no.  Archerbortion      No! What\'re you, gonna type random words in there the rest of your life? All five minutes of it! At which point Ms.  Archer will probably walk in here and dissolve me in a drum of acid, unless you have a better idea.    State dependent memory!   So, your plan is for us to get as black out, knee walking, shitfaced drunk as we were last night, in the hopes that we remember the password.  Well don\'t hog it all! Pam! Ugh, seriously, I bet that would\'ve killed a lesser man.  There\'s a lesser man than you? Uh yeah, his name\'s Houdini?   Whom I wish you were      Yeah, cause then I   could just puke up a key   Because you\'d be dead.  Houdini\'s dead? You know what? Yes.  Here\'s what we do, we lure Bucky down here, and take him hostage.  And then? Then we\'ll see.  We\'ll keep it loose.  Oh for, and just how the hell are we supposed to lure him down here?! Sterling Archer? What\'s that? Sorry, I couldn\'t hear you over the sound of my plan working.  Telephone! It\'s you mudda!   My    Wait, please tell me you didn\'t tell her I was temporarily the pirapi king.  No not yet, but this is damn good I Nnngh! Sterling?! Sterling are you alright?! No Mother, I\'m a captive of pirates! Oh, and Riley said he no longer finds you attractive \'cause you\'re too old! He what?! What?! You little Sunamabeetch! Grrk! Was that a gunshot?!   Yep, they got ol\' Ray this time   Raayyy! And now I keel you! Rrrgh! Right in my same ear! Ha! Good, serves you right!   Malory, I never said   You\'re no spring chicken yourself, you know! Rrrnh! Lanaahh! Is Lana hit?! Someone talk to me! Mother, I\'m a little busy right now.  Noah! What?! Spoon him! You mean spoon him as in like oh! Today please! I am incredibly sorry.  Grrk! Rip?! Rip I take it all back, you\'re as strong and sexy as the night we     For shit\'s sake, Mother! How short is the list of guys you haven\'t screwed?! Oh, how dare you? You can forget about that ransom! For once you\'re on your own!   For once? Oh my God, Columbia Hou    All I wanted! Was to mourn! The murder of my crazy hot Russian fiance by becoming a pirate king! But I guess that was too much to ask! So Mother can keep her stupid ransom, because I don\'t need her! What I do need, is some frickin crab shampoo! Noah! Wounded!   No, I\'m    well, maybe some psychic scarring, but physically I\'m      Tend! To the wounded! Oh, right.  Not him! Start with Lana! I\'m fine! Check on Ray! Yeah, he is not looking good.  Although, neither is Riley and neither is your situation! Because you can forget ransom! Now you and your friends will die here! Yeah, speaking of forgetting, couple things.  One, these aren\'t my friends.    Got that right   I mean her, yes, kinda, maybe,   but there\'s a lotta weird sexual tension   Ha! But these other three, whatever, who cares, I mean Noah\'s a slave.    Yeah, about that     Noah not now! And two   Aha, but I shoot gun many times! And in all the excitement I lose track myself! So now you thinking, did he fire eight shots or only   Four.  Idiot.  So get your things, we\'re leaving.  Hey, can I run up to my hovel and grab the only extant copy of my dissertation? Noah? Still got four bullets.  Do you know what "extant" means? You know what "license to kill" means? I\'ll just um write another one.  The world holds its breath.  Ray?! Ray, c\'mon honey, stay with me! Ray.  Ray! Ray!!   Not sure that\'s helping!   Yeah neither are you! Lana, I only have two hands.  What I don\'t have, is all day! There, I finished! Jeez damn! How ya doin, Riley? How the hell do you think I\'m doing?! Hey relax, Nick Furious! Save your strength for flying the chopper.  And again, I am just incredibly sorry.  What\'s your blood type? How would I know?   Wh ? How would you not?! Who am I, Karl Landsteiner? Discoverer of blood groups? You don\'t know your own blood type, but you know who discovered them.  Yeah, now Your exact words, Pam! "Dr.  Charles Drew, or I will eat a bag of dicks!" Bring \'em.  And not to diminish the accomplishments of Dr.  Charles Drew, but God damn it Archer! Ray needs O positive blood, or he is gonna die! So give him some of yours!   I\'m A negative! Hey, me too!   And even if Riley\'s O positive   No, I\'m A negative too.  He\'s already a quart low.    Sooo   Oh.  Positive? Yeah.  One of these days, I swear to God, I am going to burn this place straight down to the ground.  Oh my God yes, hey, what about this Sunday?! Unless you want people in here, in which case weeohh my God! Waagh! Five oh, five oh! Cyril! Never mind moving that money.  What money, oh! Really? You sure?   Because all I need to do is just   Re evaluate your entire life, and yes, I\'m sure.  Sterling can get himself out of this jam.  For once.  Oh and don\'t be here on Sunday.  Pam.  Why just me, what\'s happenin\' Sunday? Probably my grisly murder, since we still haven\'t found that password! Ya try "guest"?   No Pam, I didn\'t, because I\'m not an      Oh, eat a dick.  Bring it.  How much of my blood does he need?! I dunno, ten gills.    Wh ?! U. S.  or imperial?!   Just keep sqinueezing that gag ball.  That I don\'t wanna know why you have.  No, you do not.  You will never make it to helicopter! My men will cut you down like dogs! Thanks, human shield.  Although Where the hell are all your men? Wh ? Are you serious? They\'re all at the intramural lacrosse finals.  The what?! Oww! Lana shut up.  That\'s today?! It\'s right now.  Well, in ten minutes.    Who\'s playing?!   Archer.    Uh, the Lax mi Singhers   They made the finals?! Versus the Archers of Loafcrosse.    Wh ?! That\'s my team! Archer.  Lana, I\'m team captain! I built that team from nothing, and now      Archer! Ray is dying.  Does that mean so must my dream?! Look, I think it\'s great that for once you\'re getting out of a jam without your mother\'s help, but      Not for once! Hello? Columbia House? But remember earlier, when you said that you and I were friends? I, of course.  I mean I know we fight a lot, but God, now that I think about it, you\'re my only friend.  Wow.  Right?   Yes, Archer, because if you do this   Please don\'t make me choose.  I will never, ever forgive you, and we will never, ever be friends again.  Woooo! Birds eye view of lacrosse! Lana, Lana, we got the face off!   Hooray!   Now can we please get out of here?! Because we are totally vulnerable! I know, look at our defenders! He\'s not talking about the defenders.  The crease, idiots! Guard the crease! And what are my middies doing? Middies! C\'mon, get in position! Oh shit, they are!   No look, they\'re all bunched    oh.  Iiiiincomiiiiiing! Eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee!   Hooray!   Wait wait wait, Lana    Get some! Get some! You sons of bitches! Suck it! Nooooooo! Hang on! Lanaaaaa! Archerrrrr! What, Lana! I Nothing, I got you.  You got me! Well that\'s just super! What the hell is your problem?! My problem! Is you just Bonnie and Clyded my starting middies!   Wh ?   They were Red shirt freshmen, Lana! Who I was grooming! But now I guess the Archers of Loafcrosse can forget about the South Pacific lacrosse championships! Yeah that\'s not a thing.  If and when that becomes a thing! Here\'s a thing.  Your mother doesn\'t know you ran away to be a pirate, so   No!   Lana, seriously, she   Would literally kill you.  Well, figurative yeah, literally.  So now, for the rest of your idiot life, I\'m got that on you.  Wow.  Right? Oh my God! Just screw already! Seriously.  Then kill each other.  Then shut up.  And then kill each other again.  And call me, so I can watch you do it.  Sterling, I don\'t know how you did it, but, well, except for Rip\'s eye you got everyone home in one piece.  No thanks to you.  Well, it\'s about time to did something on your own.  Oh for Columbia House! Record Club! Archer! The important thing is we\'re home.  And that we spare Malory the details of your time on pirate island.  Why, what happened? Nothing! Well, you know, besides a lot of um, pretty horrific torture.  Which mother, if you had seen would have broken your heart.  But why dwell on that? We\'re home!   And my mourning period, for um   Katya.  Is over, so hey! It\'s a happy ending! Yeah, it\'s just a big ol\' goddamn fairy tale.  Fairy tale.  Uh, phrasing? Ray, I\'m kidding! Don\'t be like that! Oh, gross keep it moving, cripple! Shut up.  Ray? Ray.  Ray! Oh, okay! Then I guess just pout!And so, here is what I propose   We finish these, get some roadies, head back to my huge penthouse, drink chilled champagne served by my valet Isn\'t it pronounced valet? Only if he\'s parking your car, then we slip into my new hot tub and, ya know, see where the evening takes us.  Well, I have to wait until my friend comes back from the powder room Well yeah, obviously we\'re gonna wait for her, she\'s the hot one.  Pig! I\'m sorry, is something funny? Just that last part, where she slapped you.  Yeah?! You like physical humor?! Depends on the situation.  Ow.  You okay? No, I\'m not oh    oh my God! You\'re Burt Reynolds! Yes, yes I am.  And if I let you up, are you gonna do anything stupid? No, no I\'m not.  Hi, Sterling Archer.  Sterling Archer? Yeah, you\'ve heard of me, huh? Well, just from your    Press clippings, yeah, it\'s pretty hard to stay anonymous when you\'re the world\'s greatest secret agent.  Calling yourself that can\'t help.  Hang on, true story, Operation CIA? That movie\'s basically why I became a secret agent in the first place! Really? That movie was just God awful.  What\'s awful is I almost punched you! No you didn\'t.  And I\'ve seen all your other movies like five times! Sam Whiskey, Navajo Joe, Fuzz, Hooper, Shamus, Shark, The Longest Yard, Deliverance, The Smokies, White Lightning, obviously Gator, uh, oh! I even saw At Long Last Love! I thought you were great! Really.  Well, I wanted to.  Me too.  Listen, I kinda have a date.  No no no wait wait wait! Sorry.  Lemme buy you a drink, I wanna tell you my idea for a Gator sequel! Gator was a sequel.  I Know, and this will be the final chapter in The McClusky Trilogy! Trilogy.  Huh.  With twice as many airboats as Gator! Twice as many would be none? What\'re you talking about, Gator had   Speedboats.  Not airboats.  Really, are you sure? Pretty sure.  I directed it.  I    okay, but this one has airboats, and they\'re central to the plot, And it sounds great, kid, but like I said,   I kinda have a date, so   I get it.  You gonna take her upstairs and give her "the longest yard"? Yoo hooooo! Mother?! What are you doing here?! What are you doing here?!   I\'m kicking it with    Burt? Oh no   Yeah so remember how I said I kinda had a date? It\'s kinda with your mom.  Hope that\'s not gonna be a problem.  Oh please! Burt Reynolds didn\'t give you a black eye, the floor did! When you fainted like a schoolgirl! It was an involuntary reaction, mother! To seeing you all tarted up to meet my hero in a hotel bar for sex! Oh for    we were meeting for drinks! I mean obviously sex was implied, but   Ugh! And since when is he your hero? Wh ? Since always! Eeeast bound and doowwn! I thought that was Richard Petty.  Which doesn\'t even merit a response.  And you cannot date Burt Reynolds! Can, am, and will continue to do so.  I\'m serious, I\'ll do something drastic! You will not.  Mainly because you\'ve got bigger things to worry about.  I\'ll be the judge of    a Cuban hit squad is in New York to kill me?! Apparently.  This intel\'s a week old! Why are you just telling me about it now?!   Because Pick up Sterling, pick up, pick     Mmyello? Sterling dear, it\'s me.  There\'s a    Ha! Voicemail.  You know what to do.  Oh for God\'s sake.  Hello? Sterling, dear it\'s me.  Hold on, hold on! Hang on.  Sterling.  Don\'t hang up.  Hello.  Sterling it\'s    Elaborate voicemail hoax.  Leave it.  And then I just sort of forgot about it, because that same night, I met    Burt Reynoooolds! Is on line oooone! For you, for some reason.  Burt dear, what a lovely surprise! I\'m sitting here with just a mustache and memories of last night.    Oh, Burt   Rrrgh! and also a blanket.  The AC in my room\'s stuck on freeze.  Deliverance, Gator, and this is him in Cosmoooh! How totally hot is he?! I swear to God, you could drown a toddler in my panties right now.  I mean not that you would, but    Hey! Shut up! You\'re not my supervisor! Wait, who is my supervis   Carol! Oh right.  Go get my gray fox out of cold storage.  Burt Reynolds is taking me to a movie premiere tonight, so    help me God, if you throw that computer on the floor again you\'ll wake up in a mental ward with total amnesia under someone else\'s name.  That\'s actually kinda scary.  Eh.  Wouldn\'t be the first time.  Archer, hey, about this expense report   Not now, Cyril! Mother is ruining what remains of my life before a Cuban hit squad assassinates me, so    Matalo! Wh ?! Yeah laugh it up, Lana.  I am.  You almost got shot in the face.  Get off.  You get off.  Cyril.  I\'m pretty tense right now.  Because of the Cubans? Or because Burt Reynolds is doing your mom? Yeah, laugh it up! I am! Burt Reynolds is actually banging    Archer! You broke my frickin nose!   What\'s that?   Sorry, I can\'t hear you over the sound of I broke your nose! Bullying Cyril isn\'t gonna make Burt Reynolds stop shtupping your mom.  He\'s not doing that! But even if he is, which he is    No he isn\'t! This Cuban hit squad is no joke.  So if I were you, I\'d lay low in the safehouse for a few days, until we work out a plan to neutralize them.  Ohh! Yeah, okay! The safehouse! I\'m sorry, your words made sense, but your sarcastic tone did not.  Because there are no Cubans! Mother just wants me out of the way so she can do unspeakable things with Burt Reynolds! So nice try, idiot!   I love it that I\'m the idiot   So unless the building is literally on fire, none of you are to call me.  Because, as I may have mentioned   Fifty times.     tonight I will be attending a movie premiere with Burt Reynolds.  Oh my God, that totally reminds me! This came for you.  From him.  And you opened it?! That\'s how I knew it was from him.  Give me that! "Dear Malory, it\'s been   " Dear Malory, it\'s been real, but I\'m dumping you for a young starlet and heading back to Tinseltown.  Do not contact me.  Regards, Burt Reynolds.  "Regards!" They weren\'t even warmest! Wait a    who calls it Tinseltown? Carol Channing? Or somebody who just thinks that\'s what movie stars call Hollywood.  Stockard Channing? Archer.  His mother, dating his mancrush? I bet Archer kidnapped him.  But how?   Archer goes to Burt\'s hotel room   Knocks him out Archer? Knocks out Burt Reynolds?!   With gas   Oh shit.  And then hides him somewhere.  Like an idiot kid hiding a lamp he broke.  You really think he\'d do that? Yes, really.  I\'m serious, if you ever go near to my mother again I will do something really bad.  Well, then you should probably just go ahead and get it over with.  Don\'t worry, I    wait, what? Because if you don\'t kill me, and I get loose? You\'re gonna wish you were in hell with your back broke.  I don\'t have a response to that.  They never do It\'s my own fault, I should\'ve known! They tell you they love you, and then they just cast you aside when some young starlet catches their eye, with her perky little boobs! I bet they were perky and big.  Jeezow! Why are you torturing her like that?! Why are you asking rhetorical questions?   Aww, that\'s actually kinda sad   Alright, here\'s the plan, I say we go rescue Burt Reynolds, and as a bonus, beat some sense into Archer\'s head and ass.  Yeah! Right in the head and ass! So Pam, Carol, stay here with Malory.  Everybody else, let\'s go to Archer\'s.  He\'s got a Cuban hit squad after him.  Why wouldn\'t he go to the safehouse? A, because he thinks they\'re imaginary, and B, the safehouse doesn\'t have a    New hot tub! Fifty jets, hand hewn California Redwood, no big deal The California Redwood is endangered.  So? I already got my tub.  Woodhouse, Burt Reynolds.  Burt, Woodhouse.  Hi.  Loved you in Gone With The Wind.  Not him, shut up, get him a drink.  What\'s your poison? Pimm\'s Cup? Odd choice Well, this whole thing\'s pretty odd.  What\'s odd! Is you wanting to date my mother! Why\'s that odd? Because you\'re you!   And she\'s, um   Beautiful, smart, funny, successful Like, one of those, tops.  Not to mention drop dead sexy.  Oh dear God yes.  Woodhouse! I shall fetch a cucumber! You have to not date my mother.  Can\'t do it.  Can\'t, or    Won\'t, whatever, pick one.  Well then, here\'s what\'s gonna happen.    You\'re gonna drink your Pimm\'s Cup   Which is exciting! Never had one! Then I\'m gonna knock you out, and you\'re gonna wake up in a mental hospital with total amnesia, under someone else\'s name.  Hey, now there\'s an idea for a movie! Yeah, I think it already was.  I wasn\'t in it.  Well, maybe not, but   Fade in! A mental ward! White walls, white sheets, nurses in crisp white uniforms, broken men shuffle like zombies we see a hospital wristband on a man\'s arm, John Doe.  And we slowly tilt up, to see the man\'s face Gator McKlusky.  And he\'s looking out the window, the afternoon sun on his face, and there\'s a spark of recognition in his eyes, cause you know what he\'s looking at?   No   The Okefenokee Swamp.  There\'s a mental hospital there? Right on the water.  And guess what\'s tied up right out there at the dock? An airboat! And the head nurse falls in love with him and finds out who he really is so she helps him escape and they get chased by a bunch of dirty cops but in the end they win! And you just got a screenplay credit.  For real?! Oh yeah, maybe even   Your Pimm\'s Cup, sir.  Doesn\'t it come in a silver chalice? Ah.  That would be a pimp cup, sir.    Ohh   I hate to sound Hollywood, but could you put my Pimm\'s Cup in a   Pimp Cup! Certainly! It would be an honor, Mr.  Gable! Maybe even what?! Executive Producer.  Executive producer?! But I\'m not Falling for that! You big liar! You\'re not gonna make that movie! Oh, I absolutely am.  And once your ISIS buddies find out that you kidnapped me and come find me, I\'m gonna give them all an EP credit.  No, you\'re not! So drink your stupid Pimm\'s Cup    Yeah, where are we on that chalice? Because nobody is coming for you, Burt! And especially nobody from ISIS! Okay, don\'t take this the wrong way? But I\'m kinda wondering how you\'re gonna be an effective field agent.  Interesting.  Coming from a woman.  Excuse me? Burn! Eh? Esto es Archer, no? Creo que se, pero esta paralizado? Al parecer.  Sera mas facil, eh? El invalido.  Matalo! I mean don\'t get me wrong, I\'m all for affirmative action, but    Oh my God! Okay, first of all    Hey guys? Hey guys? Zip it nerds! First of all, I was twice the agent you were when your legs worked, so don\'t hand me that   Shit! What the    Duck! And this conversation isn\'t over! Isn\'t it?! No no no no! My brand new van! Holy shit! Lana! Hang on! Cuban hit squad! I gotta go! Would you go?! I can\'t yet! And now I do actually see your point.  Krieger, go! Vamonos! Damn! Krieger can\'t outrun anything with all that handicapped shit.  I gotta go after them! But this conversation is not over! You\'ll never catch \'em.  Yes I will! No you won\'t.  I\'ve seen you drive.  You drive like an egg.  You think you can outdrive me?! And I\'ll bet on it.  Go on If I don\'t catch \'em, I will just ride off   into the sunset   Where they don\'t have telephones to ever call my mother again, ever.  On my word.    And if I do catch \'em   You keep dating my mother, yeah, got it.  And since we\'ve wasted a shitload of time already, I feel pretty good about this bet.  So let\'s do thiiis! You\'re kidding me.  I know, it drives me nuts.  It\'s like the world\'s slowest elevator.  This is like the world\'s slowest van! It\'s all this handicapped shit! Jesus God, I get! Your point! You should get a bat pole.  Nine thousand bucks.  What? Lowest quote I got.  That\'s ridiculous.  For basically just putting a pole where the garbage chute already is, but the co op board was like "But what\'ll we do with the garbage?" Yeah, but you can still throw it down the, whatever, the same shaft.  I know.  And then you\'d have some garbage to land on.  If you\'re coming in hot, I know, it\'s a win win.  And you were gonna pay for it yourself, no assessment or anything.  Yep.  Ridiculous.  Preaching to the choir, buddy.  That\'s not your car, is it? Yeah, why?   Nothing, just   Didn\'t know they sold those to men.  Yeah, laugh it up, Burt.  I am.  Aaaaaaaawwww shiiiiiiiiiiit! Burt it\'s too fast! Too fast! No such thing.  Yes such thing! Slow down! Don\'t you wanna help your friends? I don\'t care about them! Yes you do.  You just pretend you don\'t, because you\'re afraid of    Dying in this frickin car! Emotional intimacy.  Oh my God, you    You are such an asshole! Lana?! Lana, we\'re coming to help, where are you?!   Heading north on the FDR at   60th! Getting shot at by your damn Cubans! Which is totally not cool! Great! Tell her to keep going north! Doesn\'t matter, we can\'t catch them, we\'re all the way acrawww shiiiit! We\'ll catch \'em.  I know a shortcut.  Wh ? How?! I did a TV series here called Hawk.  I forgot about Hawk.  He was part Indian.  Right! Whoo! Now it\'s officially a chase! Hooray You know what your problem is? My pants are wet? You only see your mother as your mother.  But she\'s also a person.  She has hopes, dreams, fears needs.  Don\'t make it weirder! Not sexual needs    well, maybe those too   but personal, professional, all the stuff that makes a person who they are.  And until you    oops, hang on.  Holy shit, Burt Reynolds! Hey, if you\'d pay attention you might just learn something here.  I\'m sorry, I can\'t hear you over the sound of my giant throbbing erection.  Owww! How bout now? It\'s gone, I\'m all ears.  Good.  Because my point is oh wait, wait, you\'re gonna wanna see this.  See wh    no! Burt noooo! Please don\'t do this.  Oh shit! My pants are now literally wet.  And my point is, until you can look at your mother and see her not just as your mother but as a person, a real person you can\'t grow up.  Huh.  Food for thought.  And if I were you I\'d come to terms with that, because I plan on seeing a lot of her.  And uh, by "a lot of her" I mean    I get it! But I guess you\'re outta luck, because we had a    Bet.  God damn it.  Now whaddya say we have some fun?   Whatever   Oh my God, not the van.  Will you please! Drive straight! No, serpentine, serpentine! Oh! Herroooh!   Herroh   Holy shit! It\'s Burt Reynolds! Buenas! Now watch what I do right here.  Yeah duh, I only invented it.  Oh.  Nice to meet you, Hal Needham.  Whatever.  Ha haaaaa! That was actually pretty sweet.  Uh oh, looks like we\'re in danger of a   frown turning upside down   Cut it out, that tickles.  Burt c\'mon, seriously, cut it out   Burt watch the goddamn road! Oh shit.  Sorry about that.  You should be, that was totally irresp    Wait, was that the same footage? Thanks, Burt! Anytime, darlin!   But uh, you probably wanna go ahead and slow down   Oh, shit! Krieger, braaaakes! I am! They\'re not doing anything! A round must\'ve cut the brake line! That\'s okay, I got it! What do you mean you gawww shiiit! Um Hang on, everybody! Everybody okay? Okay?! No, we\'re not okay! Look at vanispheres!   No, we okay   Dont you touch me! What    is that a ghost? No, it\'s    never mind.  We\'re good.  Thank you, Burt.  Oh don\'t thank me, thank    oh, right.  Now if you\'ll excuse me, I think we can still make that movie premiere.  You\'re taking me to the premiere?! Leave me for some hot little twenty year old.  Well, I\'ll show him.  I\'ll go find a ten year old.    Ew.    Yeah, I don\'t think you wanna do that.  Shut up.  Okay, taxiiii! Yooou! Malory wait, I can explain   Save it! Nobody wants your, your    Mother, Burt didn\'t       mustache rides around here, buster! Mother! Ugh, listen, Burt didn\'t write that note.  I did.  You what.  I know, I\'m sorry, I    Oww! Oww! What is wrong with you?! A lot, actually.  He\'s kind of a mess.    I am too, look at me, raccoon eyes   I think you look beautiful.  And I, for one, would love to walk you down the red carpet.  And I, for one, would be delighted.  Have a good time, Mother.  And I honestly mean that.  Oh blow it out yer ass.  Burt Reynolds is so freakin awesome.  Yeah yeah he actually kind of is.  And, I for one, am gonna go watch Hooper and masturbate til my fingers bleed.  Just tape \'em up.C\'mon Cyril, beat it, get outta here.  This meeting\'s for field agents only.  Which brings me to item one.  We don\'t have enough field agents to effectively run our covert operations.  Especially since this one went and got himself paralyzed.  Yeah that\'s me, Mr.  Selfish.  More like Ms.  Anyway, effective immediately, I\'m promoting Cyril to field agent.  What?! Do what?! Hey, that sounds great, best of luck.  Where do you think you\'re going? Oh, sorry, I gotta get back to Earth before the Stargate closes.  Get back in here! Mother the chevrons are locking! And Cyril is utterly, laughably unqualified to be a field agent! Some offense.  Some taken.  Well, none of you were qualified when you first started.  And you\'ve already given Cyril some training Which ended with a dead hooker in my trunk! No it didn\'t! It easily could have! Malory, you can\'t just    End! Of discussion.  And since this meeting is for field agents only You\'re taking me out of the field?! Well, unless we need someone to go undercover as a shopping cart.  [annoyed sigh] This is Roman Calzado, the notorious Colombian drug lord.  And hopefully an infusion of much needed capital.  Since when are we bounty hunters? Since the DEA\'s budget was gutted by all those federal spending cutbacks.  Which is ridiculous, given the current economy.  The most efficient way to decrease the budget deficit is to increase tax revenue, through, um Cyril don\'t make me regret this decision.  Sorry.  And if you were in my tax bracket you wouldn\'t be spouting that socialist propaganda.  Or wearing such shitty clothes.  Or doing such shitty missions! What are you talking about? The reward is a million dollars! Exactly, and how many drug users could be treated with that money? Who cares?! Seriously?! Lana, they\'d just go buy a million dollars worth of crack with it.  You don\'t give them the money.  You can\'t, they\'ll blow it on crack.  Oh my God.  No they won\'t, because it\'ll in the ISIS bank account.  Because you\'re going to get Calzado, dead or alive.  And Cyril, dress appropriately, you\'ll be helicoptering into the jungle.  Coool Oh, and this whole thing reminds me Pam? Nine AM Friday morning, all ISIS employees will take a drug test.  Nkay.  And knock off that damn beatboxing! Ugh.  Last week it was freestyling.  Yes, this LZ! You dumbass! Where we are right now! In twenty four hours! And you better be here! What a dick.  Well he\'s probably just under a lot of stress.  Since he\'s our only way out of th stupid jungle! Dumbass! Seriously Thanks, ghost of Teddy Roosevelt.  Ms.  Archer said dress for the tropics! Tropics or Busch Gardens? Hey, ya know what?! Yes.  Heckle? Jeckle? Between us and Calzado\'s fortified compound there\'s about ten clicks of jungle that I just assume is one giant booby trap showroom.  So shut your dickholes, get your gear, shut up again, and start walking.  Any questions? Cyril.  What\'s a click.  Yeah you say that all the time and I never know what you\'re talking about.  I\'m assuming it\'s a sound of some sort? Nuh uhh! Swear to God, first thing Friday morning we all gotta pee in a cup   Which I can\'t even do y\'all Cleaning out my freezer last week, found a big bag of skank.  I guess I brought it back from Jamaica, but    But it\'s just a pot test, right?! No, stupid.  All drugs.  Oh shit.  I call \'em grooving bears.  How bout you, Ironsides? You rollin dirty? Umm Possibly.  Well then we\'re all screwed.  Talking about the drug test, huh? Duh.  Well    What if I told you I had a way to beat any drug test in the world.  Are you telling us that? Yes.  Well? What is it?! I call it Krieger Kleanse.  It\'s an herbal tea, all natural, and it\'s guaranteed to rid your body of all traces of any illicit substance.  Well here, gimme gimme give it! Ah ah ahh! I literal   figuratively scoured the globe for these special herbs, at no small expense to myself.  Ugh.  How much.  Hundred bucks each.  [ Complaining ] Or you can save your money, and try your luck in the current job market.  Non sequential bills, please.  Well then why not just say kilometer? Because shut up.  Jungle ziiing So it says here that Calzado isn\'t even the head of the whole operation Cyril.  He\'s actually just a distributor for somebody named La Sombra.  The Shade? Cyril.  No, I bet in this context, The Shadow.  Cyril.  Oof.  Hey, what\'s your problem? My problem is I don\'t want a thousand of steel balls to shred my genitals.  Huh? Claymore mine.  Full of steel balls that fly a thousand meters   or one click   a second, right at dick level.  Jeezy petes Or ass level, which in your case would also take off your head.  So quit reading and pay attention.  But there\'s a lot of useful stuff in here, organizational charts, inventory and cash flow analyses spreadsheets? Of what, possible outcomes with a twenty sided die? Well you don\'t need a spreadsheet for that Yeah and you don\'t need one to know you\'re gonna suck at being a field agent Cyril.  So why do you wanna be one? I dunno, I just wanna feel like I\'m a part of the team, ya know? I guess I wanna feel like I matter more.  Wow, not afraid to dump out your purse in the jungle, huh? Okay Cyril, then lesson One A.  In a potentially hostile environment, like this, the key is total situational awareness.  Okay You look, you listen, you smell.  And you remember to check your six.  My six what.  Is that my gun? The old six shooter.  Oh my God, a clock Cyril, It means behind you.  Because the last thing you want is    Uh Lana, hold up a sec? Archer we don\'t have a    Cyril? Yeah, that\'s why I said hold up.  Archer! Don\'t yell at me, I looked away for literally literally one second! Well where the hell did he go?! I dunno, it\'s like he just You\'re looking for Predator, aren\'t you? Yes.  Couple things.  A, he\'s invisible    Not totally, he has a telltale shimmer.  Ow! And B, lower your frickin voice.  MAN: Oye!! Manos arriba! Is that Cyril? MAN: Quien es?! No, it\'s not whimpery enough.  Cyril! Cyril! God damn it.  Well, look on the bright side.  Which is? Which is what? What\'s the bright side?! Oh.  That\'s a figure of speech.  All I\'m saying is there are a million green rectangularly reasons to complete the mission, and zero reasons not to.  You mean besides Cyril getting captured.  Yeah! Besides that.  And if Calzado\'s men got Cyril, we\'ll rescue him when we get Calzado.  Problemo solvedo.  What if it was F. A. R. K.  or V. E. L. N.  Then we\'ll use some of the million dollar reward to pay his ransom.  So shut up, Cyril\'s going to be fine.  Unless a tiger ate him.  Tigers don\'t live in South America.  Well at least one does because I just heard its spine tingling roar.  That was a jaguar, dumbass.  Thanks, Marlon Perkins.  I think I know a tiger when I hear one.  Every time, your big fat mouth get\'s us caught, every time.  Not every time, like a third of the time.  And a thousand bucks that\'s a tiger Lana.  If this doesn\'t work we just paid a hundred bucks for liquid fart.  Yeah, well here\'s shit in your eye.  Oh god, it tastes worse than it smells.  Man, if I had a nickel for every time I heard a guy said that, I\'d have eight nickels.  Archer, I swear to God if you don\'t shut up.  I\'m just saying if it comes down to that, and I hope it doesn\'t, there\'s no sense in us both getting raped.  Fernando, our special guests must not be injured in any way.  Uh, does that include rape related injuries? Of course.  No one is going to rape you.  What is wrong with you? We\'re scared.  We\'re just tourists, see, and our car broke down.  So the assault weapons and plastic explosives, why do you have these? O. : yes, let me explain.  Busted, we\'re arms dealers.  No, I think not.  I Think you are hunting Roman Calzado.  In the hopes of a million dollar reward.  O. K.  yes, busted again.  But I think now we\'re kinda rethinking that.  So, if I give you two million, will you go away and say you never found me? I    Oh my God, totally yes.  Then we give mother a million and you and I can split the other million.  Calzado, you\'ve got yourself a deal.  Excellent.  But of course I was joking.  Obviously I can not allow you to live.  No, yes you can.  Or choose not to, whatever, besides, throwing money away like that would not please el contador.  El contador, doesn\'t that mean.  The accountant, si.  Cyril?! Que? No he said cereal.  Que? Cerealas.  El quiere desayuno.  And people in hell want ice water.  Oye.  Pardon.  Oh my God! I\'m gonna die in a toilet stall just like the gypsy said.  Damn that Krieger.  Nazi clone bastard.  Well, we don\'t know it was the tea.  Aagh! Who the hell are you?! I\'m your friend, Pam, I\'m    Pam?! You\'re not my friend, you\'re a Decepticon.  Waaaagh! How are you both still alive?! The floor is lava! The floor is lava! Clinical trial thirteen.  Subjects\' responses are exceeding expectations.  Pam you\'re melting! You\'re melting! Because the floor is lah vuh huhhhh! Must! Kill! Decepticon! Oh, which reminds me: call Terry.  RROWWR! The tiger says RROWWR! The tiger also says you owe me a thousand dollars, so   No! I don\'t! Because I didn\'t bet! The welsher says Psssst! No, that\'s a snake.  Oh boy, am I glad to see you guys! Cyril, what the hell\'s going on?! Are you a drug dealer now, or? What? No! And you guys aren\'t gonna believe what happened! I had, um, gastric distress, or whatever, so I was just gonna duck off the trail And you remember to check your six.  My six what? Before I knew what was happening Oh man, right in my new pants! Oye! Hellooo HENCHMAN:! Manos arriba!! Quien es?! And I only had a second to answer, so I thought, what would Lana do? Not Archer? No, I had to outsmart them.  He said, suddenly too big for his shit caked britches.  Archer.  And then it came to me! Uh quien soy? Soy el contador! Enviado de La Sombra! Donde esta Calzado?! What\'s a La Sombra? Calzado\'s boss, don\'t you remember the dossier? No.  Yes.  But, what about the gunshot? Then they brought me here, and I bluffed my way through the rest La Sombra did not say you were coming.  Well, I assume he did not want to give you the time to cook your books.  I    that    I swear I don\'t do that! Well, then you are a fool.  Que? You pay La Sombra sixty four cents on every dollar you make, no? Mmmmas o menos, pero I can get that down to thirty cents, and he will never even know.  Si?! Pero como?! You just leave that to me, amigo.  Wait, what\'s in this for you? We split the difference, of course! But first I need some clean clothes.  This is not mud all over my pants.  It\'s caca.  Holy shit, Cyril! Literally.  Yeah, really kinda wish I\'d skipped the diarrhea part Forget that, you did great! Really? It figuratively kills me to say this Cyril, but yeah, you did.  So now what, what\'s the plan? Oh.  Well, I was hoping you guys could come up with something.  And ideally before tomorrow at dawn.  Why, what\'s    What is going on here?! Ah, amigo! I was just mocking this giant negress and her sissy sidekick.  Yes, they are ridiculous, no? Are the accommodations to your liking? Honestly? No.  You shouldn\'t even keep animals in these conditions.  Look at them.  Cement floors, steel bars, no room to run around, nothing to play with Ah, I think perhaps you are confusing this with a zoo.  I think, maybe, it\'s all these exotic animals.  Yes, exotic animals for me to hunt.  You hunt them?! How can you do that?! Like this.  God damn dude.  But you see? Even the majestic Bengal tiger is too easy to kill! It\'s boring! Which is why tomorrow at dawn, I will be hunting the most dangerous game in the world! Jai alai? Us! What?! Si.  So sleep well, amigos! I want you rested and strong for tomorrow! Venga, Senor Contador, cenamos juntos! So yeah, try to think of a plan! Well, go ahead and say it.  Say what.  How since we\'re gonna die in the morning we should have sex now.  After seeing a tiger get murdered, Lana? No offense, but I\'m not really in the mood.  If you want, I can watch while you masturbate.  But I can tell you right now my he\'s not gonna be in it.  It will be with that tiger\'s family.  But, go ahead, start.  And so begins the hunt for the most dangerous game! Hooray So what are the les here, exactly? Lana be still.  You get a thirty minute head start.  Then El Contador and I, just us, alone, will track you and kill you.  Uh, uh oh! Can they split up? Ehhh, sure, why not.  Then I propose a friendly wager.  We each hunt one of them, and the first to kill his quarry is the winner.  I like this idea.  But which    I get the woman called it boom! I    alright, since you called it.  Oye! Cochino Okay, let\'s hunt some humans! Go go go go gunngh! Are you really that selfish?! Apparently! Clinical trial thirteen, update.  As hypothesized, after mind shredding hallucinations, subjects B and C have lapsed into deep unconsciousness Subject A, however, remains at large.  Begin clinical trial fourteen Lana? Lana.  Where the heck is   shmmpf! Don\'t scream, it\'s me.  Oh thank God, I thought those were yeti hands Never gets old.  But good idea back there, getting everybody to split up.  Thanks, yeah, I figured you\'d know to head back to the, uh, LZ thingy    Which we\'ve only got about an hour to get to so       and I figured once I found you we could work together to rescue Archer, capture Calzado, and escape.  Ya know, you don\'t actually suck at this.  Really? You\'re thinking tactically, making quick decisions and I gotta tell ya, confidence is pretty damn sexy.  Reeally Theoretically.  Sorry.  Okay, you\'re doing pretty well so far, so what\'s the plan, rookie? And sooner would be better than later.  Yeah, Calzado\'s on a darn threewheeler.  Can you believe that guy? Who, the drug lord who hunts humans for sport? I know, but that\'s just lame.  Cyril? Uh, uh, okay, so we have to assume Archer\'s heading back to the LZ too, but he can\'t possibly outrun Calzado Yeah, neither can we, so? We don\'t need to outrun him! Just Archer! What? Come on! Oww! Oh eat a dick, jungle! Cover it with malaria and leeches, sprinkle some dengue fever on it, and eat a big goddamn jungly dick! Yeah, you do that, and I\'ll just wait here for a bask of Orinoco crocodiles to wander by and eat me.  Oh great, that\'s probably them now, tearing around on specially equipped croc choppers.  Wait, what the? Goddess of the Jungle, I take it all back! For when I was thirsty, you saw fit to slake my thiiiiiirrrrst! Goddess of the Jungle, you are a whore.  Oh thank God, I thought you were crocodiles.  Crocodiles? On a three wheeler? Right? How scary would that be? Mmm, probably not as scary as knowing that I am going to cut you down from there, and then gut you like a fish.  Well then you\'re obviously an idiot when it comes to crocodiles, AKA the world\'s most deadliest predators.  I am the world\'s deadliest predator! Or are you? Que? Cyril?! No breakfast for you! No, that\'s my name, Calzado.  Cyril Figgis ISIS agent.  Bastardo mentiroso! ISIS?! That\'s right.  And you\'re under arrest.  Albeit extra judicially.  Over my dead body! Well, that can be arranged.  Lana? Hellooo Ay, caramba Wh ? Wait a minute, was I just bait?! That\'s right, Archer.  All part of my brilliant plan.  Lana, get some vines and tie him up, chop chop.  Chop chop? Here we go Uh yeah, it means hurry? C\'mon, we got a chopper to catch, tie him up! You do it.  Okay, I see what you\'re doing here.  Hands behind your back, Calzado.  Make me.  I    look, she will shoot you! No I won\'t.  No she won\'t! C\'mon Cyril, go all rogue on him! Guys c\'mon, this is ridicul    ungh! I think I\'m gonna be    ungh! Yeah, I\'m gonna be sick Here, maybe this\'ll help Aaagh! My eyes! Probably shouldn\'t have done that.  Not enough left to get drunk on.  Bastardo! I kill you! Lanaaaa! What the hell damn guy.  Oh thank you thank you thank you You\'re welcome, Cyril.  So, did you learn any valuable lessons today? Yes, I did.  Me too.  I learned I don\'t like being bait.  Owww! Sorry, Cyril, did that hurt? Cyril.  Cyril.  Cyriiillll! Yes it frickin hurt! Yeah, right? What?! Yes, obviously I heard what you said! I just can\'t believe the head of the DEA has the balls to say it! Oh, is that a fact! Oh it is.  M hm.  Yep.  So, uh How\'d that go? Oh, fine.  He was just explaining to me why ISIS won\'t be receiving any reward for capturing Calzado.  [ What?!] Because apparently there\'s no proof that we did.  We literally handed Calzado to them! And in return, did they hand you a signed receipt for the prisoner? No, they    oh.  Oh, shit.  Mm.  So, well done.  Because that\'s exactly the brand of unparalleled professional excellence that I\'ve come to expect at ISIS.  No no no no nooo! What the    Oh, I wish I was still blind.  You\'ll never take me aliiiive! What was I saying? Oh yes, unparalleled Paaaam! For the love of God, seal the exits! Professional That\'s our pee, and that\'s the last I better hear about it.  Because this stupid building is a tinderbox, and I will burn it to the ground.  Excellence.  Oh hey, speaking of excellent, did you hear we met a tiger?! But he got murdered.Lemme go! You have no jurisdiction over me! I\'m a Canadian citizen! Yeah, and we\'re taking you to Canada, so   Help! Help! Extraordinary rendition! Extraordinary rendition! Light him up, newbie.  Sorry in advance.  Owww! That hurts like, insanely bad.  That\'s why I said sorry in advance.  And you have to have to stop yelling "extraordinary rendition. " A, nobody cares.  And    Be careful! You big lummox!   I swear to God, if you scuff my bags   Oh, I wouldn\'t dream of it, ma\'am.  And I can do without the sarcasm.  Oh, no ma\'am, that wasn\'t    Enough! With the backchat! Ugh, Lana, maybe you can talk to him.  Um?! So this is the infamous Kenny Bilcoe?   You don\'t look like much of a terrorist   That\'s because I\'m a freedom fighter! For a free and sovereign Nova Scotia! Is that why you blew up a donut shop? Allegedly! If you believe Canada\'s illegitimate, so called "government!"   I\'m pretty sure we do   Which is why we\'re taking you back to Ottawa.  And once we do, hopefully the Mounties will start sending us all kinds of lucrative work.  How noble.  Speaking of work, can I put what I just assume is your rock collection on the stupid train? Yes, the    nooope! Nice try, Pam.  What? You want to get on that train so you can stowaway! Just like on the blimp! The what? Okay, no biggie.  Have a nice trip.  I    wait a minute.  What now? Too easy.  Pam\'s up to something.  Booooarrrd!   Well, I doubt she\'ll make it on now   Ditto for Archer.  Wh ? He\'s not here? Mmmmmm nope.  Need to get these bags on, ma\'am.  I heard him! George!   Malory, don\'t call him that   My name actually is George.  Really? Dammit, I told Sterling six o\'clock! I thought you meant six a. m. ! No, six    Sterling are you drunk? Winnerrrr! Nice.    Archer   You knew we were transporting a dangerous terrorist to Canada! So how and why are you drunk at six o\'clock? Well the how\'s pretty self explanatory, and the why is because, hic, I thought we were leaving at six a. m.  tomorrow.  Ergo, Latin, plenty of time to sleep it off.  Well drink some coffee, because there\'s a good chance Bilcoe\'s terrorist pals    Alleged terrorist pals!    are going to attack the train at some point, and try to bust him loose.  Awesome! Right? I\'m sorry, how is that "awesome?" Because, hic, pretty much my whole life I\'ve wanted to fight some guys on the roof of a speeding train.  Well if I know my boys, you may just get your wish, big guy.  Thanks, Freddy Foreshadowing.  Who is this? Please tell me he\'s a renowned chicken and waffle chef.  Because. .  I am starving.    The Limited     So listen,   you look like a pretty smart guy   Well thanks,   I like to think so   So why dontcha do yourself a pretty smart guy favor and just let me go?   Uh, because    Ms.  Archer would kill me? Well what do ya think\'s gonna happen when my boys storm this train? Oh, I\'m not too worried about that.  Ya should be.  My boys are bad ass.  Well, so am    Lana.  And I\'m learning.  Oh, and don\'t forget about Archer.  The drunk guy? He may have seemed drunk, but he\'s   Still drinking? Relax, Lana it\'s just a bloody mary.  And by the way, not a great one.  Mr.  Vodka and Ketchup.  Archer, at any time in the next twelve hours this train could be attacked by radical Nova Scotian separatists.  Armed with what? Pamphlets about Canada\'s responsible gun control laws? The New Scotland Front has guns, and they\'re not afraid to use them, so    So okay! God, I\'ll switch to coffee.  Hey Heinz 56, can I get an Irish coffee.  No! Lana, I have to taper off.  Trust me, if these Noma Scojens are a real threat, you do not want me hungover.  Do you even still get hangovers? Normally no, but I drank about two gallons of mamajuana this afternoon.  I was playing dominoes with a, Dominican bike gang, or was it Mahjong.  I don\'t remember.  Ridiculous! This thing\'s a sardine can.  How are people supposed to travel like this? Most people bring less luggage.  Most people fly.  So your days of sullen superiority are numbered.  I have no response to that.  They never do.  Now let\'s go find a bigger compartment.  I\'m afraid there aren\'t any.  Nonsense, I\'m sure there\'s one here somewhere.  Why are these all locked? They\'re occupied.  So if you don\'t mind    What I mind is your familiar tone, young man.  What\'s through here? Those are private cars, ma\'am.  What do you mean, "private?" I mean they\'re not    Not for you to be knocking on! Now I have to insist that you    Get yer panties untwisted!   Damn Wh ? I knew it! I want this train stopped immediately and this stowaway forcibly disembarked! Afraid I can\'t do that, ma\'am.  You can and you will, or I\'ll have your job! No, she won\'t, George! Carol? What are you doing here? Uh, trying to perform my ablutions? But    This is Miss Tunt\'s private car.  How do you have a private train car? Uh, cause she owns the railroad? Well, half.  And I knew you wouldn\'t let us go on this stupid trip to Canada, so I had my cars hooked up.  Cars? Plural? This car, two sleeping cars, a private dining car, and one that\'s just a teeny tiny skating rink.  Er, two sleeping cars? Do you think there might be room for    Nooope.  It\'s already cramped back there, what with that piss reeking ocelot.  Plus George says you stiffed him.  Wh ? No I didn\'t, I gave him a tip! A stick of gum? Well? Really? Did you not have a button? You button it, missy! Oh we don\'t know the meaning of private, lets all pile in.  Lana check it out! Actual gas lamps! Amazing, Archer, yes, so you think we can go guard the prisoner now, or    RROWR! Is that Babou? Or not.  Apparently.  Okay    Wowww! Lana! Cyril! Jesus! Lana! And Pam.  Lanaaaaa! What? He remembers me! Cyril, why are you in here? I didn\'t know where you guys were.  It doesn\'t matter where we are, Newb Gingrich    Then get out! where\'s the prisoner? In my compartment.    At least, he was   Although he doesn\'t seem to be in here now.  No kidding.  Mmmmmm nope.  ARCHER Lana! Cyril!   Oh my God   Too late, he\'s gone.  Thanks to Cyril.  Well he\'s not gonna jump off a train going eighty miles an hour, so    So, yeah.  We\'ll sweep car by car, moving from front to back.  Good, you guys do that, I\'ll get a big raw steak from the kitchen.  Are you talking about the ocelot? Are you not? I\'m talking about the prisoner!   Oh.    Well, maybe they\'re together.  Although I doubt it, Babou\'s kind of a loner.  Like Paul Newman in Hud.  If Paul Newman had constantly sprayed piss all over, um oh what was her Patricia Neal! Who I hate.  Sorry for the intrusion, folks.  Nothing to worry about, just some standard, umtrain security.  Okay, that\'s all the regular cars.  Now we get to search all the sleeper cars, thanks to your incompetence.  Well you left me unsupervised.  So this is my fault? Mmm, fifty fifty? Fifty fifty you accidentally shoot somebody, Newb.  Now come on, it\'ll take us all night to search this damn train.    Well, but with Archer helping   I wouldn\'t exactly call it helping.  Here kitty kitty kitty.  Kitty? Excuse me, is there an ocelot in there? No no no, what\'re you doing? Besides making a ms all over my train? Looking for a terrorist and an ocelot   What?    not necessarily in that order.  Okay that\'s it, we\'re stopping.    Frank, this is George, we gotta   Give me that! He\'s gotta keep the train at top speed so they can\'t get off.  So tell him to keep it floored.  I will do no such thing.  Okay then here, hold this? Why are you giving me a    oh my! Sorry, but I\'m not letting a terrorist escape.  And obviously an ocelot wouldn\'t survive in the frozen wasteland of upstate New York.  So.  Sorry Frank, uh, Miss Tunt says she wants to beat the record run to Ottawa.  Those crazy Tunts.  Okay, hang on Jesus!   Boys, hang on a sec   Okay boys, make sure you bring the heavy stuff, cause these crazy ISIS bastards aren\'t playing They just killed a black guy.  I know, right? Welcome to America.  How is that racist? Never mind, look    I treat all servants exactly the same, regardless of their race.  Hang on, I hear freedom ringing.  At worst I\'m elitist.  But not racist.  Whatever.  Cyril and I searched the front half of the train, but we didn\'t see any sign of Bilcoe, okay so    I bet it\'s hard to see   anything from that high horse   So.    Unless Archer found Bilcoe in the back half of the train   Which, no, he didn\'t.  Jeezy Petes! Archer! Is that blood? What? Oh.  Yeah, but it\'s from a cow.  You shot a cow? And Bilcoe\'s not in the back half, so you guys must\'ve missed him.  Which, no, we didn\'t.  Which, yes, obviously you did    Or you did.  Or you did.  Because there\'s no way he got off, we\'re moving too fast.  Oh my God we totally are! We might beat the record run! You guys probably don\'t understand because don\'t own a railroad? But it\'s actually a pretty huge deal.  To whom? Railroad owners? We\'re a pretty competitive bunch.  No, Pam! No means no, now stop it! Whatsa matter? Ya chicken? I\'m in a wheelchair! Ow! Bawk bawk bawk bawk bawk bawk! Ow! Goddammit Pam I don\'t wanna race! Couple skate? I can\'t believe you have a skating rink train car.  Yeah, apparently my great grampa was nuts for skating.  That and the Klan.  I    okay, so let\'s try this again.  Car by car, this time back to front.  Good, because Miss Stingy here won\'t let me eat in her private dining car   Oh my God we\'ve been over thaaaat    so when you pass the dining car, have a porter bring me a Cobb salad.  Before or after we locate the dangerous terrorist? Before.  Sorry folks, uh, go back to sleep.  Yeah, just disregard the gun toting spies and the blood smeared everywhere.  Oh yeah, keep an eye out for pawprints.  Where, in the blood? Yeah, I assume at some point he\'ll come out to like lick it.  Come on, we\'ve only searched two cars, so we\'ve got a shitload to go.  Uh, speaking of, I need to make use of the facilities here Fine, but catch up, okay.  And pay attention.  Yeah, they look just like prints from a housecat, only bigger and awesomer.  Go.  Hey, welcome to the bathroom.  Well, thank you.  No, no, wait, what\'re you   Ungh! I can tell you never played much hockey, huh? Probably too busy runnin around shootin black guys.  What\'s the word, boys? Fantastic! They\'ll never see that coming! I\'ll see ya at the border! Archer, we don\'t have time for this.  It\'ll take like, two seconds! God!   Okay so, a Cobb salad   I am not taking that woman a salad, Cobb or otherwise.  George, trust me, you don\'t want to see my mother with low blood sug    Wait, why are we slowing down? We\'re at the border.  Of? Uh, this new place, called Canada? So? So, customs, passport control, immigration? You know, the border? Yeah, but with America.  They still guard the border! Lana, we\'re going into Canada! Okay, can you please explain to him   Don\'t do that.  Okay, already knowing your answer, I\'m going to ask, "Don\'t do what. " Make this a weird racial thing.    I knew, and yet I asked   What, I just don\'t wanna be ganged up on! George, back me up here.  I\'m gonna back way up, and not be in here when the mounties catch you crazy people with all those guns.  Oh, shit.  What, they\'re Canadian, they don\'t even know what a gun    oh, shit! He said, realizing that    That what\'s the perfect disguise for some terrorists who want to board a train to bust loose another terrorist? Oh, shit! The    Royal Canadian Mounted Police, folks.  Please have your passports and declarations forms out and ready.  Ready? Yeah, but what if they\'re like, actual real mounties? Well, not to belabor the point, but they\'d still be Canadian.  i. e. , I doubt we\'re in any real danger.  Okay, here goes Freeze! Hands up! Get \'em up! I swear to God if any of you Canadian fruitcakes move I will shoot that stupid hat right off your head.  That, that\'s not okay.  Get \'em up Dudley Douchebags! Maintain the right, boys.  Whoa, dude, we\'re serious, we\'ll shh    iiiiiiit! God damn it, Archer! What, Lana? You are so! Stupid! Thinking terrorists would be disguised as    Royal Canadian Mounted Police! Stand down, boys! We\'re mounties! Piss off! We\'re mounties! Great, good, we\'re all mounties, so no need for a Mexican standoff, eh? Oh yah, hooz aboota co opt s\'moor American stoof there, eh, Cahnada? Stuff like Mexican standoff?   Oh, look at that, the race card Wh ? Let\'s all just put down the guns, boys! C\'mon, we\'re not Americans! RRROWR! Unvaccinated animal! Put him down, boys! No! Serpentine, Babou! RROWR! Aw jeez, he sprayed me! That reeks! Did he get away? Ya, ugh, he ran right oat past us! Good.  Then screw this.  Please tell me that\'s a smoke grenade.  Okay.  It\'s not, though.  Whooo Hoh lee       shitsnacks! What was that? Probably my stomach growling.  I am literally starving to death.  I don\'t care, Frank! We are gonna beat that record, so put this stupid train in train gear, and jam it! Rrgh!   I\'m surrounded by mediocrity   In what way? In what possible way did that work?   Umm A, they\'re all incapacitated   And B, I got to blow up a train.  Well thanks, Gomez    Nice.  But that doesn\'t help us find Bilcoe! He\'s right there, stupid.  Wh ? Jesus boys, what happened? I happened.  Drop it, Bilcoe.  You drop it, ya racist bastard! Gagh! Oww! Wait, how am I a racist? Really? Shut up and come on and shut up! Wait, we don\'t know which Mounties are the real ones! What do we do? Archer! I\'m kidding! Jesus Lana Hey, good guys and bad guys! All of you just got a pretty huge pass, so don\'t make me regret it later! Deal? Come on! I\'m taking that as tacit agreement! Cyril, what the hell are you doing? Being blind! Oh my God, I\'m blind! Sweater! Huh? Oh.  When will you not suck at this? When you don\'t suck at shut up! Go ahead shoot me.  It\'s better than starving to death.  Everybody shut up! And then somebody get over here to be my hostage! Oh for    way to man up, Ray! Wh ? I\'m in a wheelchair! Yeah, no offense but we\'re gonna be, ya know, running around and stuff? Uh, no! You\'re not! Uh, yeah! I am! Everybody okay? Yeah, I think so.  Yeah.  Paralyzed, but other than that, fine.  Yeah.    Okay, then Lana, you guard them   Okay, what\'s the plan.  And Cyril, you keep sliding down the learning curve like the Banana Splits.  And what are you gonna do? I am going to fulfill my lifelong dream.  Meeting Mr.  Greenjeans? Snap out of it, boys! Bilcohhhhhh! I could use some help on the roof! Oh my God, this is gonna be awwshiiiit! Owww! The dust! It\'s like being shot in the eyes by a glittergun! There, that oughta do it.  Okay, let\'s try that agawwwshiit! Retinas! Seared, like tuna steaks! All I want is to fight on top of a train! Is that too much to ask? The good news, is now I\'m furious.  So, rethinking this, huh? On top of the train you\'re still like, on the train, plus you got all    oh shit! Plus you got all that.  Oh shit.  Whyyyyyyyyy      do people do this? You\'re still just on the train.  I know, right? Although, I guess sometimes there\'s a helicopter? Do you have a helicopter? Mmmmmm nope.  Just a gun.  It\'s empty, dickhead.  Yeah nice try, super dickhead.  What the? You fired eight rounds, ultradickhead.  Am I the only person who ever keeps track of that,    oww!   Wow, and I thought I was mad before   Why, didja see some old black lady sittin in the front of a bus? What is your deal with calling me a racist? Well A, you\'re American    That\'s, oh shit, racists jingoist, whatever! And B, you murdered the porter! Wh ? No I didn\'t! You shot him! There was blood everywhere! That was from a steak, you idiot! I was trying to catch an ocelot! In Canada? And I\'m the idiot? Hold it right there, boys! Royal Canadian Mounted Police! Dammit, who are the real ones? Guess that\'s for me to know and you to find out.  Well I\'m gonna find out in like five    RRROWR! Babou! He\'s corpuscular! Get him, boys! Nooooo! Babou, serpentiiiiiiine!   Yeah, so   So yeah, put that in your little secret agent notebook, along with "don\'t leave prisoners unsupervised. " There\'s absolutely no reason to ever get on top of a moving train.  Wait, what if there\'s a helicopter? Ooh, yeah, or a dragon! Ooh, yeah, or some sarcasm! Ooh, yeah, or hang on! What? Waaaaagh! Aaaaaa ungh! Babooooo! That\'s right, buddy, I goww oww oww oww oww, Babou no! Owww! RRROWWRR! Oh come on, I wouldn\'t say it was a complete failure Oh, really? And what parts of this mission would you call a success?   Well, let\'s see   Maybe the part where my non recordbreaking train is totally shit housed?   Not as shit housed as my spleen   Ooh, or maybe the part where the mounties will never hire ISIS again! What\'s it matter, we\'re all banned from Canada.    Au revoir, sweet man whores of Montreal   Ugh.  Lana? You were saying?   Ah, well, we did help with a major arrest   Kenny Bilcoe, you\'re under arrest for violation of sections one through nine of the Canadian Terrorism Act, buddy.  Sorry to cut into yer donut supply, boys.  Long live free Nova Scotia!   Oh wait, make that five   Same goes for you bastards! Plus impersonating an RCMP constable! That\'s not fair, you\'re doin it! Oh, wait!   I guess make that six   And besides attempted murder on a black guy, you\'re under arrest for violating the Exotic Fish and Wildlife Importation Act.    Yeah whatever, Dudley Douchebag   Plus you already used that once.  It was good enough to merit seconds! You hear that? They called you exotic! RROWR! Which is just people talk for awesome, which is what you are, which is why I was happy to save your life, buddy.  Rrowr? No don\'t worry, probably just thousands of dollars in fines, maybe a little jail time, hopefully just probation.  Totally worth it.  Rrowr? No, Babou.  That was all sarcasm.  Rrowr? Yes, all of it! You fox eared asshole!Woodhouse, you you sneaky old fiend   Happy birthday, sir! Thanks, Woodhouse.  This is amazing, seriously, you outdid yourself.  That\'s not all, sir! I, er sorry about that.  It\'s okay, I\'ll just wait here while you go make me a whole new birthday breakfast not covered in garbage.  It\'s not garbage sir, it\'s   Scraps of paper, Woodhouse, which by any definition, yes, is garbage.  Afraid I don\'t have the ingredients to recreate this exact breakfast, sir.  Ugh, okay then, uh Nutella waffles.    Mmmm   Damn it.  Nutella steak and eggs? Today\'s my shopping day.  Why do you even botherliving.  No time to talk, Popeye.  It\'s my birthdayyy.  Were you going to say Happy Birthday? Don\'t bother.  Happy Birthday to me.  Hmm Mmm.  I wonder what the guys in the office have planned for my birthday.  Wonder if Fudgie the Whale will be there or Cookie Puss.  Cookie Puss.  Those guys at Carvel know what they\'re doing.  Paging Dr.  Boy! Dr.  Birthday Boy! Ahem.  So, what\'re you ladies up to? Cleaning out the stupid file room.  Oh yeah? Any particular reason? It\'s full of shit? Speaking of, is that Archer? Yes, but I have to warn you I don\'t like surprises? Or doing your share of work apparently.  Who likes that? You\'d better start, because a lot of this junk is yours.  Now get to work.  Are you serious?   On my my   Your what? My never mind!

What\'s that? You want me inside you? Sterling.  You know my name? Sterling! Hm? Oh, sorry.  I believe a "thank you" is in order.  Mother, oh my God, yes, thank you! And not just   well, mostly me, of course, but Dr.  Krieger helped too.  Well, only if by "helped" you mean Oversaw the design the world\'s most insanely kickass spy car.  It\'s a spy car? Lana? Wh ?

So, I hope this doesn\'t sound weird But I kinda wanna have sex with you.  Is that alright? Ugh! Seriously Dodge? Apple juice? Not you the car, obviously, but you the blonde genie woman who lives inside you that talks.  So, what do I call you? Hello? Jeannie, it\'s me, master.  I    wait a minute, was that just a lame pre recorded video? Or are you pouting for some reason? Fine, then pout! But that totally wasn\'t my fault You shouldn\'t even be able to put the car in gear with the bar open! Besides the danger of drunk driving It\'s obviously a huge design flaw! Which is why now you\'re all sticky! Which, sorry for that.  Once we get you parked I\'ll clean you up and wipe you down with a fine chamois.  And also quit talking to you, because now I\'m pretty sure that was just a recording.  I mean it was, right? Whatever, either way I\'m done talking.  Oh, come on, it\'s full? Damn it, guess I\'ll have to park on the street.  if you get it stolen you won\'t ever get another one.  I heard you, Mother!   Somehow   Uh, duh duh duh duh duh ooo! Hiya, neighbor! The grappling hook detaches from my end? Way to think it through, Dodge.  So, clean all the broken glass and the sticky apple juice, then I need all new glassware, some real liquor Uh oh! There\'s a grappling hook in the street, get that, and then find out where to buy caltrops.  Caltrops? Yeah, caltrops.  Try, maybe "area denial weapons dot com. " Very good, sir.  Oh, did you decide to start talking to me? Nothing, Woodhouse, what do you want? Ugh, it\'s black? Powerful? Sexy? Like if Ron O\'Neal was a car? What? No No, no, no, no Noooooooo!   No, no, no, no   Sir?   What are you      I thought, maybe she had some sort of, cloak, cloaking de hi hiiice!   No, then I\'d be standing in it   You! What\'d you do with Jeannie? Steady on, sir! I swear to God I\'ll scoop out whatever organs you have left and aaaaaghhh! Sorry sir, you were going all Bilboey.  I\'m sorry.  Woodhouse.  Can I see that can for a sec? No, sir! I just wanted to read the warning label about in case of eye contact! You did not, you were going to spray me in the eyes! I totally was.  Oh my God, okay, I gotta think Would you stop? They look pretty bad, sir.  Really? Because they feel great! Okay, so obviously Jeannie was stolen.  And who steals cars, Woodhouse? Jippos.  Car thieves.  And this was obviously a ring of very high end car thieves.  So now I have to go undercover in the high end car thief whatever, underworld, and steal Jeannie back! Sounds dangerous, sir.  Not nearly as dangerous as Mother finding out I lost my birthday present.  Sterling.  Y yes, Mother? Where is your new bicycle?   That\'s what I thought   And you let her do it.    I      I\'m kidding, you couldn\'t have stopped her, she would\'ve snapped your spine.  You are just tiny.  Lana! Whaddya know, whaddya say? I know you\'re about to ask me for a favor, and I say, wait for it I    Wait? Was that even a twist off? No.  Yikes.  Is my answer.  To your favor.  No matter what it is, the answer is no.  Somebody stole my birthday car.  Okay, I\'m gonna drink some of this, and then do a huge spit take on you.  What the shit, Lana? I told you I was gonna do it.  Right, sorry, guess I\'m a bad listener.  Obviously! Malory told you not to let that stupid car get stolen! Thank you, world\'s loudest voice! Now shut up, because    for reasons that don\'t bear going into, I have to get it back before Mother finds out! Ugh, okay, I\'ll help you.  To dowait, what am I helping you do? Infiltrate whatever criminal outfit steals the hottest cars in the city.    That would be the Yakuza Wh ? And man, against those pinkieless bastards, you had better come correct.  And you know this how? Exactly? Moshiwake arimasen.  Homies.  Hang on hang on, you race drift cars? Crappily.  Oh for    is anybody not in here? I\'m not crappy, I just started! Shut up, when\'s the next race and we\'re gonna pose as your pit crew.  I    it\'s tonight, and I dunno, if the Yakuza finds out you\'re snoopin around about a hot set of wheels Oh don\'t worry about me, I\'m  Not! Going on another stupid rampage.  Well maybe a limited rampage.  No.  Modified limited rampage.  Archer  Don\'t worry about my methods! The important thing is that nobody tells  Motherrr! Tell me what.  What? What.  What\'re we doing, I shouldn\'t be in here, and neither should you Pam! Why aren\'t you out in your new car? Because Woodhouse is detailing it, because that\'s the high level of care that I\'m taking of it.  You better be.  Wow, dodged a bullet there, huh? Figuratively.  And you better hope we don\'t have to dodge any literally.  Well, obviously I hope that.  I am not super confident about this Join the club.  And I don\'t even know why I\'m here.  Join that club.  Then shut up and act like you know what you\'re doing.  I don\'t know anything about cars.  I meant as an agent, zing, okay Pam, who\'s the big cheesy san around here? That would be Mr. Moto, he\'s    Crapjacks, he\'s coming over here! So, shiro kabocha, you are back.  Hai, Moto san.  And again, just really sorry about your nephew.  He knew the risk.  But I do not know these people! Sorry hi, I\'m Randy, crew leader, and    Why does this underling speak to me? Underling?! Ar    Randy, don\'t    Listen here, Moto! I    Kare o bassuru! Uh    Right in the head and ass.  Ungh! Let that be a lesson to you! Yakuzo! Aw man, I just totally lost face! Join that club.  So uh, you rethinking that rampage?   I am, actually   Ew.  Gross.  Then can we please get out of here? Absolutely Right after I get my car.  Archer! Jeezy Petes!   No wonder it was runnin rough   Archer, don\'t    Now which one of you pussies has it?! So, just a heads up, I\'m starting the rampage now.  No kidding.  No.    I am so angry at you right now   You? Look at them.  They\'re furious.    One question, before you die   Shoot.  Figuratively!   My question is this   What are you doing? What nothing! Uh huh.  Have you seen Sterling? Ever? Tonight, now! He\'s supposed to meet me at 21 for his stupid birthday dinner, but he\'s not answering his    Mmmyello? Mother? Hi, listen, I can\'t really talk right now, can I call you back? Or are you pouting for some  Oh crap, are you already at 21? Sorry, I\'m running late, so go ahead and order me four martinis, and      Sterling Malory Archer, you inconsiderate little   Boom! Birthday voicemail, Mother! I got you.  But seriously, I bet I will be late, so go ahead pull the trigger on those    Rrgh! What kind of ass would be late for his own birthday dinner? Mmmm, the kind who\'d infiltrate the Yakuza? What.  Nothing.  What, nothing.  Carol.  Noop.  Answer me.  No, I\'ve said too much alread    Jeezowwww! You got another one in ya? Answer me! And that, I guess, is a pretty long answer to why I\'d go on a suicide mission to get back my birthday car.  Because of a stupid bicycle?! What part of "five speed Schwinn Stingray" are you not getting?! Are you    and I\'m being serious here, are you insane? Mmmmaybe some mild post traumatic stress disorder, but    But he drinks a lot, so   So yeah, I think I\'ve got a pretty good handle on it.  We don\'t even have your damn car! We steal drift cars! Imports only! Right hand drive, duh.  Okay, and why, would I believe you? Why would I lie? Either way we\'re going to kill you! Oh.  Right.  And if they don\'t, I\'m going to.  Wh ?

Sorry! Are you? Cyril here, make yourself useful! I    no, ya know what? No.  What? No! The way I see it, we\'re the bad guys here! They\'re the Yakuza! Who were minding their own business   Of white slavery    Don\'t qualify it.   and stealing cars! Not yours! Well maybe not, but   But you come in here, guns blazing, half cocked and, probably half drunk    It\'s my birthday! Well happy freakin birthday! Thank you.  Finally somebody acknowledges my birthday.  Shut up, because now we\'re gonna die! Not if shiro kabocha can help it Whoa! Pam, you\'re actually pretty bad ass at this.  Duh!

And thanks to you we wasted all night dicking around with the Yakuza, and I still don\'t know who stole my frickin  Motherrr! Sterling Malory Archer! I, uh, what\'re you doing here, did you not hear my outgoing voicemail? Did you not hear me tell you not to let your brand new car get stolen? Thanks a lot, blabbermouth! She beat it out of me! Stop it! But nooo, you didn\'t listen to me.  And then you lied to me.  And then you almost got everyone killed, and    Almost nothing! I\'ll kill you all right now! Do you mind? I\'m trying to parent! Wagh! That was for Pearl Harbor! Now where was I? Oh yes, and all because you\'re irresponsible! No I\'m    well, not with the car Are you    Sterling, you left it unlocked in an unattended garage!   I don\'t, um   She took it.  What?! Well, not me personally, I    Why? Would you do that? To teach you a lesson! About what? Life! Just like with that damn bicycle when you were eight years old!   I don\'t, um   She took it.  Wh ? You stole my bike? I came home from work, and it was just lying on the sidewalk, and I thought "Oh, this will teach him. "   Stingray five speed   But so, did you talk to him about responsibility when you gave it back? Gave it back? Well what kind of lesson would that be?   Banana saddle sissy bar   Oh my God, so what about his car?   Jeannie   Mmmm.    I\'m afraid it already has a new owner   Yeah, that\'s what I\'m talking about.  Thanks Dodge or whoever.  Yes, my ass is everywhere.  What are you lookin\' at Sucker.WD 40, Mother.  Costs like, a nickel.  Or maybe you could swallow your pride and just apologize to your super.  Oh, and to me, for ruining my Friday night, which is now being spent here.  So what, why the frantic phone call? Hello? Malory? Why did you call us? Because if it was    oh.  I\'m gonna go out on a limb and assume it had something to do with that.  It\'s not what it looks like.  Oh, well that\'s a relief.  Because it looks like you\'re sitting here with a gun.  And over there, strapped to a chair and shot to death, is a guy in a full body latex catsuit! Or am I misreading the situation?! Well technically it\'s a zentai.  Wh ?! A zentai covers the face and head.    I think a catsuit just stops here   Give me that.  I didn\'t shoot him.  So, you\'re saying the fact that your gun has recently been fired, is       is unrelated to the dead guy over there, who\'s chock full of bullets!   Well, obviously they\'re related   Yeah, do that, take that tone.  But I swear, I didn\'t shoot him! Okay.  So I guess he walked in here already shot, obviously panicking, so you had to restrain him with these leather cuffs, and then to keep pressure on the wounds you greased him up   and squeezed him into this   Zentai! And of course not, you ass! Someone broke in here and shot him! Okay, Malory? Well, unless it was the creepy old people bondage sex police, why would anyone break in here and shoot him?! No answer? Okay, let\'s ask him! Ho lee shit.  Because he\'s Savio Mascalzone.    Um   Oh for    the prime minister of Italy? The what?! And wait, doesn\'t Italy use a king? Wh ? No, they don\'t "use a king!" What year do you think this is? I    yeah, exactly, good question.    And uh, speaking of questions   No no no, don\'t    what\'re you    don\'t go back there, Sterling, I   I have a question! Mother! Why does this chair have no seat! And what! Is in his ass?! Mother! What is in this man\'s ass?! Oh please, don\'t act like you\'ve never seen a "marital aid" before.  Not in a dead prime minister\'s ass! And you don\'t have to keep repeating it! We\'ve established where it is! Yeah so, you wanna move on to why? Wait, not why that! Why he\'s here! Savio and I met after the war, when I was in Italy with Gladio.  Who\'s that, his brother?! No, it    Ewwwww! Are you finished? Hang on, ew, now I\'m done.  Operation Gladio.  It was a NATO stay behind mission, set up to counter a possible Soviet invasion of Western Europe.  But then it sort of turned into this whole weird cryptofascist CIA shitshow, starring Allen Dulles and a bunch of former Nazis.  Thanks, Holly Hindsight.  Anyway, Savio was in Italian intelligence   Rimshot.     shut up, and we were working all these late nights, there was a mutual attraction, one thing led to another   Please skip ahead   And then he got married and went into politics.  But ever since then, once a year he\'d slip away and we\'d spend a romantic weekend together.  Well, you nailed it! I mean, if this doesn\'t just scream romance!   Archer   What, Lana?! What\'s more romantic than a dildo party slash murder?! A murder I\'m trying to get a handle on, so could you shut up a second?! And he wasn\'t always into that! You mean vice versa? Shut up! As he grew older, Savio\'s tastes became more and more exotic.  And so he started introducing all these accoutrements very gradually.  Well, he\'d have to.  Thing\'s huge.  Ow! Ow! Okay, okay, I    okay! God, your hands are like cricket bats.  Shut up.  So Malory, what happened, can you walk us through the crime? Just the crime of murder, not the crime of sodomy by rubber eggplant.  Savio was in town to give a speech at the UN.  We\'d made plans to meet here, so he gave his handlers the slip and arrived here at about seven.  We caught up over a glass or two of champagne.  Then I freshened up while Savio got changed and situated.    So he put the, uh, in his own   Yes, hush.  I came out of the bedroom Savio, sei pronto? Si, cara mia, sono molto pronto! I crossed over to the chair, and tightened his last restraint Oho! Mi fai impazzire di libidine! Then I went to refill my champagne   Savio loved to be kept waiting    and then bang! In burst three men! Aaaaaghh! Oof! Che cazza?! Cara mia, che    Savio! Andiamo! Subito! Wait, whoa, whoa, back up   Why did you have a gun?! Hm? Oh, well, Savio liked it to seem a little dangerous.  You know? No, Mother, I don\'t! Jesus, what else was on tonight\'s menu?! Sex under a hive of Africanized bees?! Archer!   So, you fired three times   And missed! Can you believe it? No.  Oh, sorry, was that rhetorical? Lawyer up, call the cops.  What?! Oh, and hit the throttle on the bourbon, because I\'m gonna have to I\'m gonna have to bust you in the face a couple times.  What are you talking about?! Self defense! It\'s your only shot! We gotta uncuff him and de dildo him, obviously.  Smash the furniture like he was chasing you around all rapey, fortunately he\'s Italian so that shouldn\'t be too hard a sell, then    I! Didn\'t! Shoot him! On purpose, exactly, the gun just went off.  But you probably wanna play that a lot softer with a jury.  A jury?! When you don\'t believe me?! Mother, come on, I mean I want to believe you But those bullet holes don\'t prove anyone else was ever here.    Well, maybe those don\'t   Puttana! Ungh! What?! You got    Malory, you got shot! Yes, I know dear, I was there.  Well, lemme see, take off your coat! No! I\'m fine, it\'s just a through and through.  Mother! Malory! What, I put Bactine on it! Mother! Sterling! The Italian prime minister was just assassinated in my apartment! And so I think an apology is in order! Thanks, I know that\'s hard for you.  Wh ? You two owe me an apology! For what?! Not believing me! How about for you dragging us into your S&M   dildo sex murder freak show?! I    look    You look! I bet I\'ll never be able to have sex again without thinking about this! I bet I won\'t even be able to eat spaghetti and meatballs! Oh my God.  What? What? I could eat.  I mean, not necessarily spaghetti and meatballs, but Not necessarily not spaghetti and meatballs.  I mean I really like spaghetti and meatballs.  Man if I don\'t get some spaghetti and meatballs, I may literally die.    Oh, and thanks so much   You\'re welcome.  But you should wait\'ll you try it, I\'m just kinda winging it here.  I meant for dragging me into this.  Still welcome.  So.  We\'ve got dead Italian prime minister in the living room, which    Sucks, I bet he knew how to make sauce.  Which will be hard to explain.  Especially given the circumstances leading up to his death, which were    Dildoey.  Unseemly!   Potato podildo   So "plausible deniability" isn\'t a super realistic goal here.  So we need to sneak the body out somehow.  Sure, we\'ll just walk a dead body right out the front door! Idiot! What, then?! Burn the apartment down?! We\'re not burning down my apartment! You sure? Shut up, I hit broil instead of bake.  Well, blood loss can make you stupid.  Can I please look at your wound? No! Nor can you burn down my apartment, so think of something else.  I shall fetch a rug! Something else! You\'re not rolling him up in one of my rugs! Why not? Because then what?! We get some coveralls, and a van.  Like a carpet cleaning van, and just walk him right out the front door.  You just called me an idiot for that! Your version didn\'t have coveralls.  Could we go out through the basement? No.  We\'d have to go past the super\'s apartment, and his door is always open.  I assume to let the stink of cabbage waft through the halls, but    So? You think he\'d be a problem? God, yes.    We\'re not on the best of terms   It\'s just, at Christmas, the tenants usually gimme a small consideration, for the work I do all yeer keepin up the bildin.  We surely count on it, ma\'am.  Specially this yeer, as we had more\'n the usual medical bills.  Your point being? Just that, fer the tird year runnin Ya gimme a potato.  Oh dear, so once again you\'re faced with the classic "Irishman\'s Dilemma. " Do I eat the potato now, or let it ferment, so I can drink it later? Will I get the operation now, Da? No son yer gonnaa die.  What is your problem with the Irish? You mean besides not being on our side in World War Two? Yeah, besides that.  Wait, seriously? They were Nazis?! No.    Not Japanese   Neutral! And now, since I don\'t wanna be an accessory after the fact, how\'s about we figure out a way to get that body out of the damn apartment?! Where\'d we land on the coveralls thing? Archer? Because I don\'t even know where we\'d get coveralls this time of night, so    Soooo if we can\'t get the body out of   here in one piece   Nooope! What? Lana, it\'s the only way.  What is? No! Malory, I\'ve done some messed up shit working for you, but I am not, repeat not, chopping up a dead body! Oh.  Ewww! Mother! What! My God, do you want me to get the electric chair?! For a murder you both know I didn\'t commit?! Malory, I just can\'t.  Me neither.  Can\'t? Or won\'t.  I    Whatever, call it her can\'t, me won\'t.  No, hey, Mother, c\'mon.  Stop that! Here, here, look! I\'m gonna get help! From, from who hoo hoooo?! I need access to a two inch drain, hot water, three GFCI outlets, this bathroom should do nicely, and a pot of coffee, just like I like my women: black, bitter, preferably fair trade.  Oh, and your sauce needs less salt.    How can you      Put two halves of a potato in with the sauce, it\'ll absorb the salt.  Oh, and I assume that\'s our patient? Not ours, Krieger.  Yours.  Thank you.  Ugh, too salty.  Yeah, you got a potato? What is this, Christmas? And is Krieger hard at work? He literally might be, yeah.  Ew.  Well, say what you will about him   I did.  he\'s discreet.  So no one else will ever know about this whole   Aaaaaaaaaghhhh! What in the   Hell is that?! Hopefully my greatest work yet.  No no no no no! Whatever this is, I am not getting mixed up in it! Too late.  Hey whoa, whoa, everybody calm down! It\'s not what it looks like! Well, then, what is it, exactly?! \'Cause it sure as shit ain\'t a surprise party, Krieger! Ya big fat liar! Someone\'s trying to frame Malory for murdering the prime minister of Italy.  I bet it\'s that wicked king! So?! Why\'d Krieger drag us into it?! Yes, Krieger! Why?! I needed help disseminating him.  Ewww! Not what it means.  But it\'s still pretty gross though.  And brilliant! When I\'m done, each one of us will walk out the front door   carrying a small parcel   How small?! Eh.  Then on our way home, we simply drop the parcels into seven different trash cans in three different boroughs.  That\'s actually pretty smart.  And hopefully, when you look at all the different drop points on a map, it\'ll look like a big smiley face.  That\'s actually pretty gross.  Kind of clever.  Every time! Every single time we come over here, we have to help you get rid of a dead body! Well, you\'ve only been here twice.  Speaking of, why the hell was the prime minister of Italy here? Don\'t ask.  And follow up, did those dastardly dagoes kill him and then dress him up like a big giant penis, or    Oh God, that reminds me.  Krieger? Yeah, I found it! Found what? Don\'t ask.  Can I keep it? Keep what? Don\'t ask! Just get it out of here, please!   Yeah, take that tone   I\'d like to know this could possibly get any worse.  Well, for one thing, there\'s not enough sauce for everybody.  NYPD! Open up, please? Jeez it! It\'s the cops! Oh.  Busted.  And or the police could show up.  Oh for the    now what do we do?! Cover your arm up, answer the door, and stall them.  And then.  Somebody get me a Number 10 can of tomatoes.  What? Sorry.  Not enough sauce.  NYPD! C\'mon lady, open the door! Comiiing! Sorry, I was in the   kitchen, I\'m making spaghetti and   meatballs.  Hi, I\'m    Italian, huh? That\'s a coincidence.  Oh, are you Italian, Officer? No, and it\'s Detective.  Murphy.  Irish.  That\'s right.  But we got an anonymous tip that Savio Mascalzone was up here.  Oooh, who\'s that, some mobster? Prime minister.  Of Italy.  Doesn\'t Italy use a king? I wouldn\'t know.  Somebody dead? What? Oh! My bird.  Little Tweetsie.  Uh huh.  Well, that\'s another coincidence, \'cause this anonymous tip said Mascalzone was dead up here.  What? Oh, for heaven\'s sake! Yeah, right here in the living room.  Well, as you can see, there hasn\'t been a murder in here, my gosh! Although I guess someone must\'ve spilled a drink.  I have a few dear friends over for a dinner party.  Uh huh.  Mind if I talk to them? Heavens, no, of course not, but   What\'s in here? Bathroom? Uh huh.  My guests are in here, Detective, but   What are you doing   from the left, dear, one serves from the left! What\'s gotten into you, Calpurnia?! My mistake, ma\'am.  Well, I should say it is, Calpurnia! Muthah, your maid is    oh, hello! Evening.    Sorry to disturb your, uh   Elegant dinnah pahty, for the most elegant people in all of New Yawk.  Uh huh.  But we got a tip there\'d been a murder up here.  Good heavens, a murder? Well, apart from this sullen wench murdering good etiquette, owww! I find the very suggestion laughable.  So, you don\'t mind if I look around? Uh, no! Of course not! Calpurnia? May I speak with you in the kitchen? Certainly.  And I\'ll let you get back to your   Elegant dinnah pahty! I hate you all so much.  No one cares, Figgis, you were only invited to round out the numbahs.  What, how is this my fault?! Gee, where to start oh! The murder? Oh, I thought you meant that silly French maid costume.  Which makes you look ridiculous.  And why do you even   never mind, I don\'t even wanna know.  Good, it\'s none of your beeswax.  Here.  I hope you won\'t need it, but   Why would I need?   Oh, huh uh, noop.    Lana! Malory! I am not! Killing a   A perfectly nice dinnah, Calpurnia! By God, if you were my servant, I\'d have you over my knee in a trice! And Muthah, the constable wishes a word.  He does? I mean yes? Yeah, sorry for the intrusion.  That tip musta been a hoax.  I checked out the whole apartment, it\'s clean.    No thanks to this one   Mmmm?! Sullen wench.  I mean indubitably Lieutenant.  So then I\'ll, uh, just be on my way.  It\'s just, who would call in with a fake tip like that, though, ya know? I wouldn\'t be surprised if it was our super, Mr.  Herlihy.  He drinks.  Thanks, I\'ll check on    oh hey, I never checked this bathroom.  Ya mind? I    no, of course not.  Be my guest.  Whew! Oh! Sorry, didn\'t know anyone was waiting.  But I\'d recommend the other bathroom, I mean I did what I could, but you can only ask so much of a vanilla candle.  Dinner ready?   My God   Ugh! Yeah, he really did a number on it.  Might wanna make sure he didn\'t leave ya an upper decker.  Sorry again for the intrusion, ma\'am.  And Herlihy, you said his name was? Hm? Oh, yes.  Yes, that\'s right.  Ow! Ow! Lana, c\'mon, I was    ow! I\'ll show you a sullen wench! Right then.  That snoopy detective is gone, thanks to Dr.  Krieger, so    Krieger? What about the rest of us? The rest of you can get out of my clothes, and then out of my house.  But thank you all so much for coming! Loved it.  Never, never again.  Thanks for dead guy in a box.  Not very elegant.  Oh no, thanks for having us, amazing.  And remember, smiley face! And thank you.  Krieger, wait.  The bathroom, the body, how did you? Shhhhh! Shh shh shh shh shhhhhhh.  You don\'t wanna know.  But you do probably wanna wash your lips now.  Ugh.  Screw you, Archer! Sullen wench?! Lana! C\'mon, I was just kidding! I had to make it look good!   You had to make it look good   Well, and also annoy you.  Walther PP, chambered for thirty two ACP.  What\'s the magazine capacity? Uh. . gh.  Eight.  Eight rounds.  Plus one in the chamber.  For a total of nine.  Hey thanks, Rainman.  Your point being? Malory\'s clip was empty.  But she said she only fired three shots.  Oh my God, so you\'re saying Mother lured Mascalzone up there Greased him into a six foot manrubber, strapped him to a chair Sei pronto? Si, cara mia, sono molto pronto! Bene.  Anch\'io.  Oho! Mi fai pazzo con libido! I know dear.  But you have to wait.  Calls us What? Mother calm    I\'m on my way! Don\'t move.  I\'ll probably be back.  Then she pulls a gun on him?! Che cosa?! What is this?! A crock of shit! Because that would mean she called the cops on herself! Knowing they\'d never come back after they searched her apartment.  Which was full of people, and spotless.  Oh my God, do the math, Rainman! The wall was shot three times Mascalzone was shot five times! For a total, wait for it, of eight! Yeah.  Plus the one in her arm.  Wh ?! So what, Mother shot herself?! Oh my God! Ungh! Mio dio! Perche?! Why? I\'ll tell you exactly why.  Before I kill you.  Operation Gladio.  Gladio?! Which would mean Mother\'s been banging him once a year for like thirty five years, and the whole time she\'s been holding a grudge, just waiting to Holy shit.  She killed him.  And got us to dispose of the body.  Ugh.  But why? After all this time? Well, to be honest, until recently the sex has been pretty phenomenal    Grazie.  And I figured, eh, what\'s the hurry? But then you started getting weird.  But why you make la vendetta? Because one night, all those years ago in Rome, you and your fascist thugs gunned down a young man in the street.  A beautiful man.    Blue eyes, full lips, black thick wavy hair   Perche? What was his crime? Well, I wouldn\'t call speaking out against the rebirtof fascism a crime.  More of a mistake.  By a beautiful, idealistic young man.  Who may have beenee my son\'s father.  May have been?! You don\'t know?! Madon\'! Che tipo di puttana sei?! Che tipo davvero.  Cazzo fascista.  Who knows, it\'s Malory.  You really wanna know why she killed a guy? I do not, no.  Although I am curious why she wouldn\'t take off that trenchcoat.  Mm! Honey, you still got it.  Bow chicka bow bow! Uh huh huh! So much of this I never wanna know the answer to.  Okay, how \'bout a slice? God, what\'s with me and Italian lately?Wait, here\'s an idea: you talk louder, and maybe they\'ll just come to us.  We\'d lose the element of surprise Lana.  That was sarcasm! No way, really? Because so was that, just now.  I pretty much insist that you shut up.  Oh shit, they\'re in the armory.  Good, then we got \'em, this is the only way out.  Of the armory.  I heard you.  And I can also read, so    So what\'s in the armory? Burglars, Lana, that\'s why I\'m here and not up to my ears in stewardess.  What else is in the armory.  Well, there\'s a bunch of automatic weapons, rocket launchers, um, about a jillion grenades, oh.  They may have fire superiority.  Ya think? Lana, for all we know they\'re building a gundam suit with bazookas for hands.  Really wish we had some backup.  Who, Cyril? Or ooh, maybe Ray could run over them with his wheelchair! That was also sarcasm, since apparently now we\'re saying whenever we do it.    Are you ready?   No.  Sarcasm again, yes I\'m ready.  What the hell are you doing?!   Nothing!   Archer! What! The hell are you doing? Nothin.  What\'re y\'all doing? The alarm company called us because the motion sensors were going off.  Dukes! Yeah, the rest of us got new keycodes Monday, but you were where was it? Physical therapy.  For your limp, useless legs.  Well it\'s obviously working, you\'re on a    wait a minute! How the hell are you walking around on ladders?! Because he\'s not paralyzed! And is that not the stuff of miracles? You lying little    I never said I was paralyzed! Y\'all just assumed I was! Because you left the hospital in a wheelchair! They make you! And then I couldn\'t get a cab, so I just got back in the chair, and Spent the last six months pretending to be handicapped.  Handi capable.  So before I kick this ladder over in the hopes of paralyzing you for real, why are you in here stealing guns and grenades and what better not be my night vision goggles?! I kinda have some family problems.  So your brother, the drug dealer   He\'s not a drug dealer! He\'s a drug farmer.  Whatever, is gonna be murdered by your hometown\'s crooked sheriff? E. Z.  Ponder, yes, and he used to bully me so bad in high school Nooo! Ray, that was sarcasm.  Anyway, he wants Randy\'s dope farm for himself or he\'s gonna kill him, so I gotta go down there and stop him.    Count me in.    What?! Why?! Well for one thing it\'s eerily similar to the plot of White Lightning.  And this is Ray\'s brother, Lana.  What\'s more important than family? Getting hammered on moonshine and trying to bang skanky trailer chicks? Trying? Oh, that reminds me.    They all think I\'m married to like, a woman, so   Oh alright, I\'ll be your beard.  What\'re you, insane? "Hey y\'all, here\'s my great big ol\' black wife!" Wh ?   Lana, c\'mon.  You\'re gigantic.  Now what\'s all this nonsense about a break in last night? I swear to God, if Krieger was doing more of his    what\'s his new awful thing? Ultimate Bum Shockfights, and no, it looks like it was an actual break in.    What?!   Jeezy Petes! Did they get into the mainframe?! I don\'t know, but    We need Sterling, where is he?! He\'s tracking down, um, leads.  From the clues.  That there were some of.  What kind of clues? The kind I\'m gonna show you, if you\'re not too busy shutting up to come on.  And put Sterling through to me the minute he calls in! Which I guess will be never So, are there just no towers here? Or have we literally gone back in time? Both? Ow, you dumb idiot!   Great Great   Why am I in a, whatever, dune buggy? Remember? We picked you up last night, said we were going on a trip? No, and to where? Six Flags Over The Shittier Parts of Chernobyl? Ferlin, West Virginia.  Yeah, and you and Ray are married.  Oh my God oh my God oh my God! We\'re not actually    Actually it\'ll be better if she thinks      We\'re marrieeeeed   Super.  Ray, look out! Wh ?! is that the sheriff, and have you recently gone insane.  Yes and no.  Respectively? Now I know that ain\'t who I think it is! No shit! Ray Gillet!   Gillet?   How\'n the hell are ya? Pretty good, E. Z.  How you doin? Aw, can\'t complain.  And nobody\'d listen if I did! I hear that.  You hear what.  Not? That? What brings you back up the holler? Oh you know, just wanted to show off my pretty new bride to the home folks.  She is that.  For a minute there I\'s thinkin maybe you come back to help yer brother out with his business concern.  Naw, just back for a visit.  Well, make sure it\'s a short one.  \'Cause believe me when I tell you, ain\'t nothin you can do to help him.  Y\'all drive safe now, hear? Man, is it me or is he super menacing? Or super hot? Hey! Remember?! We\'re married?! Not until it\'s consummated.  I\'ll drive if you wanna hop back there and um enter her.  So not only is Ray not paralyzed, but his brother is a drug dealer    Farmer.  And he and Archer are in West Virginia doing what the heck are they doing? Fighting a war on the war on drugs? God damn it.  What, you shoulda looked under the stalls! I did!   Wait, I did   Yeah, I usually put my feet up on the grab bars.  Ugh, anyway, this is all obviously unauthorized,   but I promised Ray we\'d cover for him, so   Oh, no! I\'m not getting mixed up in this, and if Ms.  Archer asks me    Why is it That every time I need to use the restroom, you people are in here skulking around looking guilty?   Uh   I\'ll tell you why they look guilty Because they, or we I guess, don\'t know how to tell you that the break in was a lot worse than we thought.  How much worse?!   Uh, well, it\'s really hard to say   But rest assured we are on it, and Archer is on it, and we\'re on it.  Well I want an update in one hour! And why does it always reek of paint? Well, there she is The old homestead.  Jesus, what\'s my dowry? Tenus? Ya know what? That\'s far enough, you sonsabitches! Randy, it\'s me! Ray! Your brother! Don\'t you move.  Don\'t move a inch.  Wh ? What do you mean "don\'t move"?! I came home to help, you asshole! Well you ain\'t gonna be much help with your legs blown off.  There\'s mines all in the yard.  Ray, to be honest, I\'m having second thoughts about this whole thing    Get in line.  Randy Gillet, where are your manners?! Get these folks the map of that damn minefield so they can come inside.    I got some nice hot pie for \'em   Okay, now I\'m having third thoughts.  Please don\'t.  It would be rude not to eat her pie.  Which I assume is not only hot but also moist.  Although hopefully not flaky.  And so E. Z.  gimme a choice.  Give him my whole dang operation and get outta the holler by sundown, or else him and his boys\'ll just take it, and grind me up into fertilizer.  Well    But listen to me, just yappin.  Tell me bout this pretty new wife of yours! \'Cause I\'m kinda surprised to see you married.  Homeboy knows what I\'m talking about! He does? A New York City interior decorator? That\'s what you went with? Betcher up to yer eyeballs in poontang! Oh.  Yeah, just so many vaginas.    No offense, darlin   None taken.    Want s\'more of my pie, Mr.  Archer?   No! Yes! Thank you, Janelle, I would love more of your moist and hot pie.    Well then open wiiide   Folks, we can\'t set around eatin her pie all day.  We got a situation here.  So Krieger\'s running the logs to see if any files were accessed last night.    Who the hell could have done this?   Who knows? ODIN, the KGB, um Actually   But this\'ll take hours so we\'ll just bring you a report when he\'s done! Actually    Krieger! More type, less gripe.  And has anyone heard from Sterling? No, yes! He\'s out on the case.  Well, I want some answers, and soon.  And since there\'s nothing in these logs, I too would like some answers.    So, here\'s the thing   If I can just get what I got to my distributor, I can retire.  Maybe move up to New York City with you.  I    what, where, do what?! I\'m kiddin.  Last thing you want\'s your redneck brother hangin around No, it\'s not that, it\'s    Plus I\'d rather kill myself.  Nothin up there but a buncha you know whats.  There are a lot of \'em.  Don\'t see how you stand it.    Anyhow   Dude.  Awesome.  Sweet gracious God.  This here\'s what E. Z.  wants.    How did you afford all this?!   Farm subsidy.  He told the government he\'s growin corn, for that high flooktose syrup.  But damned if I\'m gonna contribute to the obesity epidemic.  A man\'s gotta have a code.  Right? I put my heart and soul into this, but now it\'s either roll over for that sheriff like a dog, or fight.  Like a different, better dog.  So is it just E. Z.  coming, or    No, the whole sheriff\'s department.  I\'d say twenty men, AR 15\'s, maybe grenades, uh oh, dogs.  Duh.  Ray, I\'m having fourth thoughts.  Well I got a few tricks up my sleeve.  Janelle, why dontcha take Mr.  Archer and show him the defensive perimeter.    I\'d be delighted   No, no, wait a second      Fifth thoughts!   Archer! Don\'t worry, she won\'t bite.  But speakin of, it\'s about suppertime.  You still partial to fried chicken? I    I\'ll cook it! If somebody shaves it or whatever.  What in the? Janelle?! Janelle! Randy! Wait! Dukes! So is there like, special chickenshaving cream, or? I    first of all, that\'s a rooster! Yeah, like Kenny Rogers\' Roosters    Roasters! Randy, wait! Bawk bawk.  And just what the hell is this?! Well, I\'ll tell you what it\'s not, which is, um, what it looks like.  I got caught on the fence, then Mr.  Archer tried to get me loose, and    You better git yer ass in that house.  Do you wanna have sex with my wife? No I swear, this was just an extremely unlikely mishap with the barbed wire.  \'Cause we would be amenable to that.  Well? Why you look so nonplussed? Because I wasn\'t sure if you knew what amenable actually meant.  Until you followed it up with nonplussed.  See, me and Janelle got us one of them open marriages? Like in France? Oh right, in Europe.  And I would really like that open marriage to include Ray\'s new wife.  What?!   Now look, that\'s in the bible.    Really?   Genesis thirty eight, verse eight.    Really? But even though Ray used to be a preacher he was never big on the Old Testament    I could see that.  So I doubt he\'d wanna reciprocate.  So I just need you to keep him busy while I have sex with his wife And then I get to have sex with   My wife, you son of a bitch! Yeah, I think I got    So where the hell\'s your damn pants?! They\'re on the fence.  Goddammit, Archer! Wait, hang on    Archer shut up! Ray, he was    and poor Janelle was    I gotta go make sure she\'s okay! And you better have a talk with him! I will, Randy, I\'m sorry.  A good long talk.  Like, talk for about forty, forty five minutes.  Okay, so    Stop! I have never, in my entire life, been as disgusted as I am at this moment.    Well, give it a minute   What do you mean, a cyber attack?! Apparently the uders downloaded a virus into the mainframe So this all needs to come out.  The mainframe is like Krieger\'s baby.  How\'d you get him to go in on this? I told him I\'d get Pam to fight in his Ultimate Bum Shockfights.  Is it called that because paying homeless men to fight is shocking? Noop.  Well, hello there, game changer.  He what?! Yeah, apparently it\'s in the bible? No, it isn\'t! It did sound too cool for the bible.  But why do you care? A, you\'re gay, and B, you and Carol aren\'t really married.  But Randy thinks we are! Yeah, but    that\'s actually a really good point.  I\'m gonna beat him like a rented mule! Now that sounds like something from the bible.    She in there?   Yeah, where\'s mine at? Up\'n the woods with Ray.  You gotta wait til later, maybe after supper.  Remember, no kissing.  I was    that is the wierdest rule.  I know, right? Some honeymoon.  Oh hey, do I do the face? And where the hell is Sterling when I need him? You\'ve reached Sterling Archer\'s voicemail.  Please leave a message.  Wh ? Finally, a non idiotic greeting! Sterling, I want an update, so call me the instant you get this mess      The voice mailbox of   Sterling Archer.  is full.  Goodbye.  Idiot.  C\'mere, you skinny legged sumbitch! Oh! Sorry.  That\'s okay, they\'re not my best feature.  No, I was    Not important.  What is important is that Randy gave me a bible lesson? Yeah? And what\'d the bible say? Well, Janelle, obviously the actual scripture is open to interpretation, but what I took away from it, is that we should go in the barn and screw our brains out on a huge pile of marijuana.  It didn\'t say nothin about a rubber, did it? It did not! Ray\'s still up in the woods, right? Uh oh.  No, he actually said he wanted to talk to    Randy! Whoa whoa whoa now hang on a second! You wife swappin white trash piece of    Ray, no! Randy! Yes.  Randy.  Which I probably should\'ve mentioned earlier.  Don\'t judge me.  Food.  You lucky I didn\'t kill you.  You\'re lucky I didn\'t kill you! While you were in bed with my wife! Our marriage was never consummated!   And I think we all know why   Stop! Carol! Look, there\'s plenty of blame to go around here.  I mean, I don\'t think I deserve any, but   You were gonna screw her! Yeah so, is that still on, or? Wh ?! Carol? Wh ?! Well, somebody.  C\'mon, promises were made.  Just like you promised Mama\'n Deddy you\'d always take care of me! And here we go! But they weren\'t even cold in the ground before you were galivantin around Europe! It was the Olympics! Which you lost! Bronze medal! Is not losing! And then it was off to New York City! You can just say New York.  To be a hoity toity interior decorator! You can just say decorator.  Whatever, I don\'t know why I thought he could help save my farm! Because your job?! That\'s a job for sissies! Oh yeah?! Well guess what! Ray! Is not an interior decorator.  I    no, ya know what? Yes, shut up.  Randy, your seemingly effeminate brother is actually a highly trained secret agent.  Pshh! Yeah, and I\'m something equally hard to believe is true.  It is true.  That\'s why I married him.  Well, and the bronze medal.  Prove it.  What do you want, a business card? Where do you think he got a duffel bag full of assault weapons?   Well, y\'all do live in New York City   Just New York.  Ray? Is he tellin the truth? Mostly.  So cause you\'re a spy, is that why you never come back to visit? Mostly.  And here all this time I thought it was cause you were ashamed of us.  Oh c\'mon now, why would you think that? I found a buncha your old diaries.  Well, obviously not the one with the Miss Piggy on it.  No, Deddy said he burned that one.    Ugh, great   And I\'m sorry I screwed your wife.  And I\'m sorry if I ever made you feel like I was ashamed of you.  The important thing is you came back to help me.  C\'mon, that\'s what family\'s all ab      Dukes!   Shit! Dammit! Randy Gillet! This is Sheriff E. Z.  Ponder! You come out there with your hands up! That sonuvabitch is early! I dunno, "sundown" sounds more colloquial than like, an actual    Well, if you wanna back out on me, now\'s probly the time to do that.  Randy, you may be a racist, homophobic, wife swapping drug dealer    Farmer.     but nobody murders my brother.  The Gillet boys, side by side! Janelle, cover that winder yonder! Archer, you got a little fight in ya? Yeah, I\'m pretty furious about not getting to bang Janelle.  Plus I wanna unleash the power of moonshine.  Then grab a gun and cover that winder! What should I do?! I got some red hot pokers layin in that fire! If anybody gets hit, you grab one and slap iron to it!   Awesome   And remember, it\'s us or them.  So this is how it\'s gonna be, huh?! Randy, I didn\'t want it like this! C\'mon, I tried to reason with ya! Reason with this! A\'ight then! Light \'em up!   Ow!   Janelle! Are ya hit?! Naw, a piece of    waaaaaghhhhhh! Well don\'t just set there! Shoot! Ugh, I can\'t.  I feel sick, what\'s happening, do I have cancer again? You drank too much! That\'s a thing? Looks like it\'s just you and me, brother.  Randy, you don\'t have to do this! They\'ll go easy on you! Hell, the judge is my wife\'s cousin! I bet he\'ll give you probation! Oh please! You\'re gonna murder him so you can take over his dope farm! What?! Cease fire! Hold your fire! Why in the world would you think that I, a peace officer sworn to uphold the law, would wanna murder your brother to get his marijuana farm? I    because that\'s what Randy said!   Randy\'s a drug dealer!   Farmer! And I tried to get him to quit.  I come to him as a friend, I come to him as an elder of the church, but he wouldn\'t give it up.  And so now I gotta come to him as the law.  And you accuse me of plannin a murder?! Well, you did used to pick on me a bunch.  Well I\'m sorry, I was a dick in high school.  But you gotta admit, you were extremely pick on able.  There\'s nothing wrong with Capezios! Randy, is he telling the truth?   Mostly.    Randy! You almost got me and my friends killed! Because you could never be bothered to get a real job! Well?! I only got to ninth grade! How the hell else was I supposed to earn a livin?! Diggin seng?! There is a perfectly good coal mine not a half mile from here.  And maybe you wouldn\'t get rich, but at least it\'s an honest living.  Yeah but it\'s hard.  So\'s this.    Randy!   Shut up.  And Mama never liked you.  Easy, don\'t shoot! I\'m comin out! Phrasing.  Here\'s the files you had me pull.  Oww! What the hell is on your hands?! My bum zappers.  For the shockfights? Th I\'m doing for Krieger, which is why he broke the server, to help Lana cover up that Ray and Mr.  Archer are killing cops for a drug dealer and also Ray\'s been faking that he\'s paralyzed? Lanaaaa! Or are we not telling you that? No, thank God you guys got here before they started killing hostages! Which would have been us! As the hostages! You lyin ass bitch! She\'s mad because I slept with Randy.  To get food for my fellow hostages.  So, you really think you can fix it so I just get probation? Oh God no, I just said that.  All these drugs and weapons, attempted murder of police officers, you\'ll probably die in prison.  Oh.  Will you come visit me? Probably not.  Cause you\'re a spy and all? Uh    He\'s a highly trained secret agent.  Is that right.  Well listen here If you ever find your way back up in the holler gimme a call.  I think I got myself an extra pair of Capezios layin around somewheres.  Uh ?! O. K.    should I just 911? A\'ight, let\'s move em out! Well that\'s just great.  Everybody gets laid in the holler but me.  Oh.  And you, I guess.  Since I ate your husband.  ***.Oh, God.  Ugh, no, forget the glass, Woodhouse, just gimme the pitcher For I am a sinner in the hands of an angry God.  Bloody Mary, full of vodka, blessed are you among cocktails Pray for me, now and at the hour of my death, which I hope is soon, amen.    Er, perhaps a coddled egg   No.  No eggs, Woodhouse.  Maybe ever again.  Some dry toast? Yeah, or you could skip a step and just feed me some vomit.  Not like you to get a hangover, sir.  Yeah, I don\'t know what happened.    I kinda remember being at the wake   Oh, you poor dear.  On behalf of his fellow ISIS agents, please let me be the first to offer my condolences.  And let me be the first to welcome you back into the dating pool.  And or also my new, hic, hot tub.  But after that it\'s just snippets.    I think I had one more drink there   Drink, drink, drink, drink! And then I think I took a cab Hang on, wait, lemme see some hands! Who wants chicken and waffles?! How did we bring food in here?! Oh, and also, did we lose some people?! Lana\'n Cyril bailed! Triflin bitches! Here! Less yer a triflin bitch too! Agh! What\'d I just put inside me?! Green Russians! It\'s absinthe and Milk, sweet shitsnacks lookit those! Oh! My! God! That\'s right! It\'s somewhat coming back to me! Woooo! I\'m Pacman Jones! Come home with me! Plus my valet will give you some heroin! Thankfully I didn\'t have to share.  But she did, she came home with me! I remember! I mean, Green Russians, it\'s fuzzy, I don\'t remember this But I do remember her being the best sex I\'ve ever had in my life! Er    Shut up, and that includes Europe, Lana, my Brazilian au pair! No woman has ever made me    oh shit! Sir? Phone number?! Matchbook?! I don\'t know her name, where she works Woodhouse, how am I gonna find her?! Ahem.  You might check the loo.  What, here?! Why didn\'t you say so?! Oww! Oww! Ow, ow, ow Uh, so hey, hi.  I\'m Sterling Archer, you may remember me from the strip club, and hopefully also from what was hands down the most incredible sex that I personally have ever had.  Hello? Oh right, so I know we had an implied oral agreement about heroin Heroin?! Wh ?! That\'s the last frickin thing I need.  I\'m bound up tighter\'n dick\'s hatband.  No, not were you? Did we? Yeah, we did.  And you loved it! KATHUMP! Okay, jeez, I get it! Well, you say that, but I worry that you think I\'m   exaggerating when I say   That I was the best sex you ever had? No That if anybody ever finds out about it, I will literally   Pam, look at me  I will literally murder you.    Not literally   Yes literally! You will wake up in three separate fifty gallon drums! That\'s a hundred and fifty gallons.    Of Pam\'s hot, dirty, ball slappiney   Gaaghh! Come at me bro! How ya gonna keep \'em, down on the farm, after they seen Pam ee? Yeah, how\'re you gonna I mean, my God, you can\'t, that, that was just    Disgusting! And I hoped I would never have to say this, but you finally topped your tenth grade sports banquet! I    okay first of all, Mrs.  Coach Mumford came on to me.  And second of all what\'re we talking about? Hitting on your dead colleague\'s widow?! At his own wake?! Oh, that.    Okay, so   So help me God, Sterling, sometimes I think that I\'ve failed as a mother.  Sometimes? Oh shut up, and the last thing you need is another drink.  Ugh, seriously, how can you be drinking after last night? How can you not? Because I don\'t have a problem.    Well, I do   First step\'s admitting it, Mother.  Wh ? Not with drinking!   Eh Eh   My problem, besides your snide remarks is Nikolai Jakov, head of the KGB.  And also possibly Archer\'s father.  Wh ? How do you know about that?! Because I\'m part of Everybody?   Damn that blabbermouthing Pam   Why, what\'d she say?! Besides the stuff about Jakov, which obviously is what you meant, so So, Nikolai has been dropping hints that he may want to defect.  What?! That\'s awesome! I think you mean awful.  Uh, ISIS getting an inside look at every single KGB operation in the world? And that\'s awful how? Because he thinks he\'s going to move in with me! Me, who happens to be in a relationship with Burt Reynolds, in case you\'ve forgotten? I actually did forget that.  Yeah, I never see you together.  I mean, are you like dating, or? It\'s complicated.  What with our work schedules, and work, it\'s hard to find time for actual dates.    But you do see one another   Well yes of course, but    But never in public, right?   Only at your place, or maybe a hotel, or   Or on the dirty floor in the elevator? Wh ? Pam! Get your bloated carcass    Out, I got it, I\'m on this I got it! How did she know about the elevator? I    ew.  Burt made sure I erased the security tape.  Wait, could    you don\'t think Burt\'s ashamed to be seen with me? Lana.  I\'m sorry? Well I\'m sorry, but if anybody ever found out I\'d die of shame! Well how do ya think that makes me feel?! I don\'t care Pam! Now, having said that, would you please come in this dirty toilet stall and have sex with me.  Ugh, oh alright! But this time get in there.  All ya been doin\' is givin\' one side hell.  Well, when you put it like that it sounds kinda shitty.  Thirty years of my life I giff to the KGB?! End now you, this, this traitorous cyborg?! Are seeting et my desk?! How would you put it?! Yeah, you really got cornholed, huh? Wait, don\'t answer yet, because I\'m also reassigning you to Siberia.  Wh ?! Siberia?! Barry can\'t have you moping around here, you know sowing the discontent! Is bad for morale.  Et tu, Brute?! Et me, buddy.  Rrrrrgh! So here\'s my advice to you: dress in layers.  And don\'t even think about doing anything crazy like defecting I would never defect! I love Mother Russia! Even when you\'re chopping through the ice in the toilet so you can poop? I\'m kidding, obviously.  You\'ll be like, six hundred miles from a toilet.  Sorry, had to go to the bathroom, nothing unusual, just uh, you know, normal, um, bodily waste excretion.    If you\'re quite finished   Damn near.   then go home, sober up, and make sure your apartment is secure.  Uh, why? To all three of those? Because if and when Nikolai shows up here,   he\'s not staying at my place   Well, he\'s not staying with me! Then go prep the safehouse.  Because you can bet every KGB agent and freelance assassin this side of Berlin will be hunting him down like a dog.  Who hunts dogs? Orientals, duh! So when you say you assume Jakov got on that train to Siberia, you know what you\'re doing? I mek you ess.  And Barry doesn\'t like! Being made an ass, he really doesn\'t.  And as you can    well it\'s over there now, but the telex from the Siberia desk says Jakov never showed up! Now why do you think that might be?!   Ummm   Thenk you, Boris! I wun\'t forget this! I promised myself I don\'t cry.  Promise broke.  What was that? Ellergies? To what, making sure people get on trains?! Nice one other Barry.  Now Jakov\'s got a twelve hour head start, and the details of every single KGB operation on the globe in his fat, combed over head! Da, end we hef no idea where he went! Well I assume he\'s in New York, with those shitbitchingassbastard Archers!   But   I can assume! You\'re already an ass! So contact our sleeper in New York and then cancel all my meetings this week, because I will also be in New York.  Murdering people.  Eh, dunt tek this the wrung way? But I pictured you having nicer apartment.  Why thet is funny? Hm? Oh no, sorry, there\'s a funny Marmaduke on the fridge.  A what? And this is actually, ahem, the ISIS safehouse, cheers! Safehouse?   But Melory, I assumed   Which you shouldn\'t have! What, you thought you\'d just show up out of the blue and we\'d move in together? Pretty much, yeah.  Nikolai, it\'s not that I don\'t  am not very fond of you, I mean,   we have such history together, and   End mebbe a son?   Mmmmaybe, but   But so? Where is he? Good question.    He was supposed to prep this dump   And didn\'t.     and now he\'s supposed to be here for the first shift of guard duty.  And isn\'t.  Hi, Lana Kane, you must be Major Jakov, such a pleasure, be a lamb and take those to the kitchen? So.  I think I speak for all of us when I say we shouldn\'t be the only ones guarding your maybe baby daddy.    I can\'t believe you all know about that   Wow, thet is big dog! Marmaduke.  And regardless of any personal ties I may have with Nikolai, he\'s a invaluable asset and we have to protect him! I mean, you know at least until he\'s been debriefed.  And then? What, he\'s on his own?   Um   Wow.  I\'m serious, you are literally draining the life out of me.  C\'mon, you make me sound like some kinda chupacabra, but for dicks.  A terrifying yet accurate comparison.  Where did you learn all that stuff? You know I grew up on a farm, right? Really hoping that\'s not relevant.  Ms.  Kane and your mother.    Hooray   I gotta bounce.  Later taters.  Lana listen, if this is a booty call, I\'m flattered, but    Oh my God.  You\'re supposed to be guarding Nikolai! Yeah, so about that, I mean, don\'t you think that\'s gonna be. . kinda Awkward? I actually think it\'s kinda sweet.  Little help? No, you\'re good.  The camera\'s set up for the debriefing, and one of us will relieve you in like, eight hours? Wait, where are you guys going?! Uh, a town called work? Neutralizing a KGB sleeper in Brooklyn, thanks to this intel from the major.  It was least I could do.  Since otherwise he\'d kill you? Is win win.  Is it? So! Yeah.  Sterlink! Yeah.  Is long time.  Yeah, when was oh! I guess when I was in the dreaded Lubyanka with jumper cables clamped to my balls! So da, this is a little awkward.  Yeah.  Maybe some shots? Yeah let\'s try that! Any time now Cyril.  Cyril! Lana, I    I don\'t think I\'m cut out for this.  Well, don\'t take this the wrong way, but neither does anyone else.  Just pretend he\'s, like, a rabid dog.  Oh God, just like Old Yeller! Yeah, if Old Yeller had a big stack of KGB codebooks and fif   forty thousand bucks in a floor safe.  And was also identified as a sleeper agent by the head of the KGB! Who, Barry?! What? White? You guys like smooth R&B? Duh.  Are you telling me Barry "The Bionic Douchebag" Dylan is running the KGB? Only if I can defect, too.  Because that dude is out of his damn mind.  I\'m listening.  He\'s crazy! I mean he\'s smart, way smarter than Jakov, but    oh, and you can bet Jakov\'s intel is bad! Really? This isn\'t your kneecap? Don\'t you get it? Barry gave me up so you\'d trust Jakov on the rest!   He knew Jakov wanted to defect, so   So he\'s been feeding him fake intel? I mean I assume! Because Barry\'s got a master plan, which, when you hear it, will probably make your head explo Jesus! Jesus! Ahem.  Cyril? I\'m sorry! Yes.  Yes you are.  Is I who em sorry! I should hef been there for you! Shut up, don\'t do that, I mean what were you gonna do, marry my mother? Have you met her? Oww! Dun\'t you ever disrespect her! You\'re not my dad! How would you know?! I know, right?! But I hef to say, you dun\'t look like me! And don\'t take this the wrong way, but thank Christ! Oww! Watch it! You dumb idiot! Oh man, I am so sorry! Here, lemme get you some oh my God, Cheryl? Barry?! Wow, I was hoping I\'d bump into you! Wait, really? And darn if I didn\'t! Literally! You    wait a minute, why am I thinking you live in like, Russia? Mmmmaybe the tracksuit? Duh, right, and which, by the way, you are totally rockiiiing.  Oh, that\'s just my huge muscles.  So tell me how strong are you? Insanely, wanna get outta here? Oh my God, totally, but like it has to be your place, because mine reeks of ocelot piss.    I have no response to that   Doesn\'t merit one.     and my place is currently flooding so   Hotel? Damn, no money.  Tracksuit, no pockets.  Damn it! I know, it\'s the one single drawback.  Wait, doesn\'t ISIS have a safehouse? Yeah, but You have promise that all that horrific stuff I think I remember about you is just false memories?   I   Because I get those a lot.  Cross the microchip in my heart.  Don\'t get all girly on me.  Check! Hold the door! Hold the door! Headin out? No, I thought I\'d just take all my things for a ride on the elevator.  Okay.  I actually have a date.  With Burt Reynolds.  We\'re watching Gator.  Your place? Well if we go out, you know, he\'s just mobbed, so So it\'s a DVD, a box of wine and some Hot Pockets, and off to bed.  No! Well, it\'s not a box of wine.    Pam, let me ask you something   How ken you just leave me here?! Mainly because I have an incredibly addictive personality.  So just debrief yourself with the camera, and when I get back we\'ll talk about the DNA test thing, if, ya know, you\'re still into doing that.  Of course I em still into thet! But in meantime, you think I will be safe? God, what\'s Russian for duh? It\'s a safehouse! Nobody knows where it is! Well, here it is! Neat.  Can I see your neck a minute? Oh, Barry Barry? Barry! Barrryyyygrrghhh!  my point is, if you\'re confident in yourself as a woman, who cares if he wants to keep it on the DL?   Well yes, but   But nothin! Because who\'s to say you\'re not using him for sex? Pam, don\'t take this the wrong way? But you\'re not nearly as stupid as you look.  Okay.  Mmmyello? Archer don\'t talk, just listen! Why, what\'s up?   What\'re you      Jakov\'s intel is bad and Barry\'s got some sort of master plan that we\'re clueless about, thanks to Cyril    Who has apologized   profusely   Quiet game!    so we\'re gonna regroup at the safehouse and try to figure out God damn it.  What.  Wait for it.  Ha ha haaaa! Leave it! Da, da! Keep your shirt on! Barry doesn\'t wear a shirt.  Ruins Barry\'s whole tracksuit vibe.  I swear to God, if he put as much effort into his job as he does into those idiot voicemails and you say got this from a KGB sleeper? Right before Cyril blew his head off.  What?! You son of bitch, you ektually think you will get away with this?! Obviously! Why else would I do it? Who knows with you, you\'re crezzy! Am I?! Between Archer ruining my life and you dicks turning me into a cyborg, I\'m kind of amazed I\'m even this sane.  Which is obviously a relative term, but    What are you doing? Rationalizing my behavior.  With gess.  Oh.  Killing you.  Oh.    Oh, Marmaduke   End gess is nut so bad   way to die   Well again, relative term.  End efterwerd, if Sterlink want, he ken still get some DNA from my body, end find out if I em his real father.  Which I\'m sure would provide him with some much needed closure Which is why it\'s not gonna happen.  Why, what is thet? This   glad you asked   is a block of ice with a fork frozen in it.  What are you doing with it? I am putting this fork filled block of ice in this microwave oven Now I\'m setting the timer for five    Oh heck, let\'s call it ten minutes.  Doesn\'t matter, ice can\'t tell time.    It ken unly melt   And when it does   Spark from fork, gas from stuv   Booom.    End no DNA left for papa test   Nope.  Just uncertainty and doubt.  Which hopefully, over time, will eventually drive Archer insane.  End this, this is your mester plen? Huh? Oh, no, that\'s this whole other awesome thing.  This is just a goof.  Later, tater! Sterlink.  If by some miracle this video tep survives the explosion, there is somethink very important I wunt you to know First thing is, yer shitter\'s clogged.    Don\'t care, can\'t feel my legs   Second thing is, if you want me to keep doin ya dirty on the down low    Yes! Yes yes yes.  Then we are gonna have some ground rules.  To wit! Barry?! Was here?! Yeah, but she says he took off after he    here, you tell her.  Okay so, Barry brought me here    How did he know where "here" was? No idea, but so then he strangled me, which at first was hot, he\'s super strong, but then I was like, floating toward this really bright light and some guy with a beard.  Jesus Christ  Or Richie Havens! Nikolai! End so, Sterlink remember, things are not always what they appear.  Mmmyello? Hello? Oh for    Mother this isn\'t voicemail.  Mother, c\'mon The time is exactly seven sixteen, and I wish they were, but even my voicemail pranks aren\'t that elaborate.  Mother! Sterling? Leave it just kidding.    Sterling, it\'s me   Duh.  Where are you, what\'s all that    Uh huh.  Uh huh.  Okay.  Yeah.  What\'s up? That was um my uhthe man who might\'ve been my father just died.  Awkward.  And it\'s all my fault, because instead of doing my job, I was here Half drunk and having amazing sex.  Well I wouldn\'t say amazing What? C\'mon, you were pushin rope!Ugh, what is that? I\'ve never smelled that smell in America.  I live in a "transitional" neighborhood.  As the crack dealers move to nicer ones? This better be good, Krieger.  I mean hula girls, a replica volcano, some    I have something better! A surprise! I hate surprises.  Except surprise fellatio.  That I like.  The non Midnight Cowboy kind.  Yeah, no, you can breathe easy.  Actually I can barely breathe at all.    Oh, probably the bathroom   Jesus, it\'s a    A shared bath.  I was going to say a literal shithole.  Krieger, how and why do you live here? I use my salary for "pet" projects.  Nope! Nope! I had Korean barbecue for lunch, I cannot look at a Dr.  Moreau pig baby.  Relax, you\'re gonna love this.  No I\'m not, and also I need to pee.  Don\'t be nervous, I\'m not gonna rape you.  Jesus Christ! But you were gonna flay me like a perch?! Wh ? No, that\'s a wetsuit! Of human flesh?! Neoprene! I\'m a certified diver.  Why\'s it skin colored? It\'s not if you\'re black.  What is it with serial killers and skin? I\'m not a serial killer.  Wait, why\'d you emphasize serial? I didn\'t, what? Are we doing, did I mention I have a surprise for you? Krieger! Equal parts soju sangria and fear induced adrenaline means I have to pee.  And not in that sick bathroom, so   O. K.  There\'s a utility sink in my lab.  Fine, wherever.  But no surprises.  Right.  Well.  Except for the one.  Uh, is the surprise that you\'re pirating cable? No, no, Archer, I\'ve finally cracked it! Wow, amazing, you can play YYZ.  First of all, it\'s Y Y Zed, and second of all, no, I can\'t yet, it\'s impossible.  Well    And third of all, wrong thing! Oh my God.  Krieger.  Is that? But how did?   I mean, at our wedding   I know.    There was a lot of confusion   Noooooo! Katyaaa! No ho ho hooooo! Gross and/or ick, and is she? Alive? Yeah, man.  Flick her titty.  Katya! You\'re alive! Well, on, technically.  Either way, you\'re welcome.  My sweet, beautiful Katya! It\'s you! My darlink Sterlink, you awake me like the prince of Snow White! I love you! I I love you! Krieger thank you, this is the    why do you have an erection?! I\'m happy.  Here they are! God, geese at the trough.  What? Are you   thanks for startiar my sentence for me   people standing around for? It\'s Bear Claw Monday.  And almost nine thirty, Pam, in case you were thinking about, I dunno, working.  Jeez, somebody\'s raring to go.  Because I burn clean, Cyril.  Because I don\'t glop up my engine with bear claws.  And also because    Hello, friends of ISIS!   And also because Katya needs a W     Holy shitzombies! I know, right? Still crazy hot.  How    Well for one thing, no bear claws.  is she even here?! Wait, does this mean you and me    Pam! I swear to God, if you people can\'t keep it down, this is the last Bear Claw Mon    Am I seeing things?!   No, she\'s really here   Ow, ahh! And if we don\'t file her W 9 that first check will take, like, eight weeks.    I\'m sorry, I\'m a little confused   What, by the dead woman standing here?! Dressed like a whore? Dead woman my still shapely ass.  She\'s obviously a double, carved up by KGB plastic surgeons to look like Katya, and    How dare you?! I\'m sorry? How dare you fail to recognize my greatest accomplishment to date?! You finally nailed YYZ? It\'s zed! And no, Neil Peart stands alone.  I was referring to this! Katya? On the flourish? Is when    Oh! Sorry, doktor Just like the gypsy woman said! You need to quit going to her.  And you need your head examined if you think that abomination is ever going to work for ISIS! Abomination? Baby, come on, you\'re not an abomination.  I mean, that\'s your original skin, right? Hobo.  What? Yes.  See? But    Hang on, hang on.  Katya person.  I\'m still processing the fact that you\'re a cyborg.  Yeah, way to bury the lead.  Who\'re you, Horace Greeley? And also, was I not clear about that? No!   Although she does feel a bit clammy   Ow! Stop it! You stop it! Just because she\'s a cyborg doesn\'t mean you can feel her up! Da, I hef feelinks just like all of you.    I feel love, I leff, I sometimes cry   Albeit a saline lubricant solution.  Which reminds me, we need to talk about other, um, internal lubricants like    Stop! That sounds like a private matter.  Yeah, that\'s what I\'m talking ab   And Katya! My lovely lady.  Needs to go with Pam now to do her stupid W 9.  But Ms.  Archer said   What, Pam?! That she\'s so jealous of my love for Katya, she won\'t hire a world class spy who also, spoiler alert, can do this?! Babe, you wanna?   Oh! Sorry, darlink   Hey! Wait, or do I mean sploosh? Ya know, it\'s probably not the worst idea in the world to have someone like her working at ISIS, since   Since you wanna screw affirmative action? Since the KGB has someone like Barry! Barry! Thet, thet    Don\'t worry about Barry.  I\'m never gonna let him hurt you again, baby.  Ha! It is Barry who should worry! If I ever see thet zloi mudak again, I    Don\'t worry, you won\'t! Yeah he never calls, he never writes So just go with Pam to do your paperwork    And I\'ll go try to convince Malory that you\'ll be an asset to ISIS.  Thank you Lana, that\'s    So not doing it for you.  So don\'t care.  So! Robocop! Pro or con? Neither! I don\'t want her to be an ISIS agent, and I certainly don\'t want her and Sterling back together! Well, I can understand the latter    I mean, who wears bangs?    but it can\'t hurt to level the playing field, now that    Nikolai has been murdered.  By the new head of the KGB, who is also a cyborg.  Just like the gypsy woman said! Oh for   !   Oh, alright   Really?! Katya can be an ISIS agent?! Probationary.  But if I find out the KGB is behind this    You won\'t! They\'re not! I\'ll part her out and sell her for scrap.  And I thought you were scared of robots! I    no, not Katya, she\'s different! Hmp.  Well don\'t come crying to me when she breaks your heart again.  She didn\'t break my heart, Mother, she was murdered.  Yes, and then you ran away from home to, ugh, grief bang the entire Pacific Rim.  To what? Nothing! Oh please, I bet the gene pool of Polynesia is irreparably altered.  Darlink? Baby, I was emotionally shattered.  Which, turns out, to be kind of a pantydropper.  Is alright, darlink.  I understand this how do you say? Griff bakink.  See? Is she not something special? Oh, is special occasion? Well, the love of my life, this smoking hot woman, was not only murdered and then brought back to life, she also just got a job today, so yeah, pretty special.    Uh   Shut up.  Babe? What\'re you hungry for? I am thinking.  While she thinks, bring me some soup dumplings.  No, no, I am thinking about your mother.  God, don\'t waste the ROM, or RAM, whatever.  Does she hate what I am? What you are, meaning "the one woman who can free her child from the psychological prison she\'s spent a lifetime erecting?" No, darlink, meaning a cyborg.  She\'d hate you no matter what you are.  Because I did not ask to be this way Yeah, hey, me either, vis a vis Mother.  And you? Do you think I am a monster? Baby, I don\'t care about the chips and gears and I assume some hinges? All I care about is what I see when I look into those big green   oh, I guess they\'re red now, huh? Anyway, your eyes.  Da? And what do you see in my eyes? Mostly those insane boobs.  Check! Ah.  Ooh.  Eee.  Unn.  Ahhhh.  Darlink? Are you alright? Yes, no, yes.  Yes.  Lot of feelings coming together, just trying to process.  Not gonna lie, having some dj vu here.  Ahh Ahh Ahh ow! Owwww! Which, if I gave it any real thought, would probably explain a lot.  Try to relex, darlink.  You are, how do you say? To push a rope? Sorry, babe, I\'ll focus.  But could you close your eyes? I kinda feel like I\'m banging tail lights on a country road.  I swear to God, if I went blind right this very second I\'d be okay with that.  Oh, dun\'t say that! Mr.  Sleepy Head! Sleep? I\'ve been doing yogic breathing work for two hours.  My balls are like cran baisins.  What? Cranberry raisins? Craisins? Whatever, yes, I call them cran baisins.  How are you this morning? I em amazink! Don\'t take this the wrong way, but duh.  I mean our love, darlink.  It feels like what is a giant, unstoppable wave? Wait, you know craisins, but you don\'t know tsunami? Da, then our love is like tsunami.  Or the Mountain Everest.  An apt metaphor.  Because not only am I lightheaded, certain parts of me are    Nuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuumb!   They are not coming back.    Why? In the sink? Is your vagina?! Why? Darlink, it was dirty.  The remedy for which, miss, if you\'ll forgive my boldness? Da, please, Woodhouse, I think boldness is needed.  What do you suggest? White vinegar, mineral oil, and elbow grease.  Same thing we used in the RFC to clean the engines on our Sopwith Camels.  And so, with your permission, while you breakfast on the terrace I\'ll get that little pleasure boat looking Bristol! I took the liberty of poaching you an egg.  Is not much of a liberty, considerink thet you are going to polish my vagina.  No.  No it isn\'t.  And when he woke up from faint, boom! He ren out of there fest like crezzy.  So.  You dated him.  What do you think? I think hang on.  I think if you\'re looking for insight into why Archer is Archer, you need to jump in a time machine and then go have a treesome with Oedipus and Sigmund Freud.  Thanks for nothing.  Well?! I don\'t really have a roadmap for my ex finding your robo gina in the sink.  In the sink, Cyril! In the sink! It was like a transistor radio and a veal cutlet had a baby! Well gross and/or ick   Right?!    but I don\'t see why that means you have to drink my Glengoolie Blue! Because the liquor stores aren\'t open yet, and she made me pour out all the booze at my house! Holy shit, really? Glengoolie Blue? Yeah, and it\'s three hundred a bottle I    which I haven\'t even tasted yet! Because I was saving it for a special occasion! Befitting a gift from my grandfather! Who\'s dead! Of course he is, he\'d be like, a hundred.  It\'s almost empty! Just like my heart, Cyril    Well, not your liver    because she ripped it out! Wait, your liver? My heart! And threw it in the sink! Wait, her vagina? Ow! Ow!   Oh for     The old man knew his scotch.  You are such an asshole! Wait, really? Yes, really! That was a gift to my grandfather! From Frank! Sinatra! Well then I feel even worse, because I\'m probably gonna puke it up in about five    One minutes.  But I meant about Katya.  Yes! You are an asshole about all things! But, specifically, now, about Katya.  Or could I hef done something wrung? Besides leavin yer cooch in the sink? Pam! Pam! What? That just sounds considerate.  Is just, I know he hez wery good reason to hate people like me.  Who, whores? And that\'s twice, sorry, ignore me, my whole thing is I just crave attention.  But I mean, Barry did murder her    ungh! And my possible father    ungh! And more importantly, tried to murder me! Unngh! Because Barry! Is a psychopath! That doesn\'t mean all cyborgs are like that! But Cyril, machines can hurt people.  Waaaaaaghhhh! Well you lost me there, thankfully, but    Give me that! What, was that Peter Lawford\'s? No, it was    Oh shut up, do you wanna learn something?   Probably not   Because did you know that in Chinese, the words for crisis and opportunity are the sathme word? And point? Hello?! Actually I have no idea.  They just used to say that in the hospital.  While they made us fold those pointy goddamn paper birds.  I think what Cheryl\'s   Bawk bawk! Therapy cranes! Bawk! I think what she\'s trying to say is you can either think   of this as a crisis   Or an opportunity! To get closer!   Hooray   By marrying her?! That actually was Peter Lawford\'s.  And why not, you were gonna marry her before! Before she wasn\'t a cyborg.  She\'s still kind, smart, insanely hot Yeah, and even though it\'s detachable, that vagina is like, mind shattering.  Oh yeah? What, does it vibrate, or    Ow! Ow! Dammit You started it! That\'s my fiance you\'re talking about! Really? I can look past our differences, Cyril, I\'m a much bigger man than you think.  Plus it\'ll drive Mother crazy.  Plus yes, it vibrates.  Really?! Yes, really, and Krieger? Today? Hm? Oh! Sorry.  Little thing called timing, Krieger.  And the erection\'s really not appropriate.  I\'m still happy! Katya? Baby? Oh yes, yes, a thousand times yes! When\'s the wedding, when\'s the wedding?! I can actually marry y\'all right here.  Oh for God\'s sake! Get it over with! Brett! Aaagh! Wait, do you want me to be a groomsman? No! Go to the liquor store and buy a case of    three cases of champagne! Sure, I\'ll just limp on down there.  Don\'t limp, Brett! Run! We\'re having a wedding in a few short minutes! And it\'s a win win.  Plus it vibrates.  Okay, bride and groom, check.  Bridesmaids, check.  Best man    Well, best available.  Oh for    name one, name one friend of yours.  Shut up.  Ray, don\'t you have like, a priest outfit, or? No, I wore it to Fetish Night at The Snug, and it\'s covered in    Okay! Ugh.  Red wine, ass.  And who gives this woman to be wed in holy matrimony? I do! And no mother of the groom, so    Yes! Right here! Mother! You came! Phrasing, boom! Ahem.  Inappropriate.  Alrighty! So unless anyone   besides Mommie Dearest   objects to this union    Uh, I think other Barry might.  Wh ? Barry?! Yeah, and I brought bubbly! You. .  .  Mudak! Whoa! You kiss your mother board with that mouth? And also, is anybody gonna ask how and why I knew to show up here? Is? Okay, I\'ll bite.  By tracking the satellite signal from Katya\'s internal hard drive, which Doctor Dipshit over there, bought from the KGB! Wh ?! Krieger!   Yeah, but the savings   Like, eighty bucks you saved.  But nobody\'s gonna save you, Archer.  Don\'t you have that backwards?! Archer don\'t! Everybody down.  Why do I always forget you\'re    ungh! Darlink!   Really super strong   Yeah, walk that off while I kill your girlfriend again.  Then we do the dance.  Actually, I don\'t think I\'m in any shape to dance, right now Barry.  The dance of death, idiot.  But first let\'s me and you cut a rug.  How you say come et me, bro.  Rrrrrraaarrrrgh! Ow.  Is thet the best you got? Ungh! Obviously not.  But this is    oof! Katyaaa! Jesus somebody, a little help?! We are if you\'d shut up! It\'s pound! That is pound! Pound six, pound five two! I\'m confused, what\'re we    Here! Still confused.  Ray, now! Oh.  Their CPU\'s are powered by photovoltaic cells! Without exposure to a light source they\'ll slowly lose power! Like vampires? I    no, nothing like vampires, idiot! Well I\'m sorry, Ira Flatow! From Newton\'s Apple.  Will you shut up?! If Barry gets weak enough, maybe you can overpower him! I was just gonna say that! Move! Sterling, be careful! Shut up.  Pam!   It\'ll spoil   God damn it.  Barryyyyy! Polo! Will you shut up?! Polo.  Beset, on all sides, by idiots Brett?! I thought you were dead! No, just hurt really really badly.  Although not nearly as badly as I am now.  You better not be bleeding on my carpet! No, pretty sure I\'m all out of blood.  Well serves you right, for    Oh Barry,   I am coming for you   Phrasing, boom.  Brett! Polo! And after I kill you, and defile your cyborg y corpse, I\'m gonna    wh ?! Oh for shit\'s sake! Really?! Woooooo! Darlink, I ken explen! Ray, turn the lights on! Archer no, the photovoltaics! Turn on the goddamn lights! Gaaaagh! Why do I always forget that?! And how can you explain that?! What were they, having sex?! Think so, yeah.  Called it! As we fought, it became more like, like dancing.  Bone dancing! Shut up! Katya, how could you do this? I\'m sorry I hurt you, but I realized thet even though you tried to see past what I em, Barry and I are the same.  Inside and out.  Except her insides vibrate.  Rrrragh! Ka  Always with the forgetting We are like two mermaids.  We will swim together.  So, I won\'t ask you to forgive me But could you at least be happy for me? Because I have finally found a soulmate.  No.  Or whatever Yes.  Yes.  Thank you, darling.  You will always have a special place in my Well, I guess my C drive.  Well, other Barry and I are in her other special place.  Which, again, vibrates.  Later, tator.  Well, mother, go ahead and say it.  Oh, Sterling.  You just had your heart broken.  And you don\'t need a smug "I told you so" from me.  And smug it would be, because tell you I most certainly did.  Just like that Electrolux all over again.  So   I know that sucked   Vacuum cleaner ponds? Now? Really? No idea thankfully about any of that, but if you really did love Katya you gotta be happy that she\'s happy.  Yeah She did look pretty happy, huh?Mayday mayday mayday, this is Commander Kellogg of I. S. A.  Space Station Horizon, () secure transmission () Commander Drake.  Tony, the crew has (), and we are under ().  I say again, we are under ().  Croatoooooan!   And that, Mrs.  Archer   Ms.  Don\'t.    Ahh    Ms.  Archer, I beg your pardon      Don\'t.     that was the last transmission from the Horizon.  Which, obviously pretty vague.  Vague?! You heard Commander Kellogg, he said the Horizon is under attack!   Well, under something   He could\'ve been saying underfinanced.  What?   Sterling      What, they\'re always whining about needing more money for their boondocks.  Doggles.  What? You think space exploration is a boondoggle?! Well c\'mon, in this economy? Exactly! Now, more than ever, is when we need to look to space for the solutions to mankind\'s problems.  In just two hundred years, Earth\'s population will exceed her capacity to produce enough food.  And even as the famines begin, global war will erupt as fresh water becomes scarcer than gold.  But if we begin now, using the lessons learned aboard Space Station Horizon, a small group of brave colonists, can terraform Mars.  And mankind can finally slip the surly bonds of Earth, to live forever among the stars! Yeah, Lana.  Wh ? Jesus, read a book once in your life.  So where does ISIS fit in, Commander?   Well      Well I think that\'s a bit premature, until we discuss our fee structure.    As to that, you can name your price.    Oh now they\'ve got      Enough! Commander? As to our role? Horizon has an international crew.  American, German, Chinese, French     Ba dum bump! Sorry, I thought "French" was a joke   Is mutiny funny to you, Mr.  Archer?   I dunno, maybe a mutiny of clowns   Because I fear that one faction, led by radical nationalists, has mutinied.  But who? Which one?   Well if I      If he knew, he would tell us! Read a book! And since I don\'t know which faction is behind the mutiny      If there even was one      I can\'t trust anyone at the I. S. A.  Which is why I came to ISIS.  Because of our loyalty.  Or lack thereof.  Or whatever.  Because I need a small cadre of highly trained agents to fly into orbit and help me to retake control of Horizon.  Nooope! Yeahhhp! Archer! Lana! He just said "highly trained"! And last time I checked, none of us were even lowly trained to be astronauts! Well how hard could it be? Incredibly.    But since apparently money is no object   The training schedule will have to be highly compressed, because the shuttle Intrepid is launching in three days.  And I won\'t lie to you, this mission will be dangerous.  Would you say we\'ll be venturing into a zone of danger? Well yes, obviously.  No, but    how would you phrase that? I    the zone will be one of danger? No, I mean say    oh forget it, never mind.  And you never mind and also shut up.  Oww! Jesus Krieger, that\'s the bone! Oh, da mean doctor take widdle baby\'s bwud, and widdle baby goes    owww! You\'re a baby.  And astronaut training sucks complete ass! Literally! What is the deal with all the enemas?!   Uh      And why do you need so much blood?! And wait, now that I think about it      Why is this man in the restricted area?! Who, him? You.  Wh ? Krieger! Uh    smoke bomb! And why aren\'t you with the other trainees? I was told I had to undergo a bunch of extremely invasive medical tests.  Well normally you would, but by our doctors.  But since you\'re on such an accelerated training schedule    Six enemas is a luxury we can ill afford, got it.  Six?! Or    who knows, he put me under.  Maybe twelve.  Now you\'ve wasted half a day, so the other trainees are way ahead of you.  Not for long they\'re not! Well he\'s eager, I\'ll give him that.  Well, you inspire him.  With all those medals on that powerful chest.  Your wife is a very lucky     I\'m a widower.  Oh! Difficult to meet people, isn\'t it, in jobs like ours.  I only mention it because I also happen to be single      Yes, I know.  Excuse me.  I hope to God that was alcohol.  No! Yes!   Dammit Archer, it\'s     It\'s my turn! Cyril! Cyril! Drake said lemme fly it! Cut it out, Archer! I\'m landing! C\'mon, baby, keep that nose up What the   ?! Explosive decompression.  Explosive decompression.  Happy, Cyril?! You just destroyed Alderaan! Dammit, that was closer than any of us have gotten to actually landing! A, because you\'re all crap, and B, who cares, we\'re not gonna land it!   What the hell         is going on in here?!   Archer      Saw an electrical fire in the simulator, and knowing that my colleague\'s life was in danger, I    You acted without thinking! As always.    Not always   Well, thank God you did      Wh ? But almost always!    because that\'s exactly the kind of decisive action this mission calls for.  You could all learn something from him.    Oh my God   Starting with a little training exercise we lightheartedly call The Vomit Comet! And if you\'re wondering why we call it that Gagh! Aw, it\'s all in my hair! Oh Jeezy H.  Petes! What the hell is wrong with you, Lana?!  that\'s why we call it that.  What possible reason, could there be, to subject human beings to    SKEWWWWWWW   Such mind shattering awesomeness!   The KC 135 flies in a parabolic arc     Woo hoo hoo hoo caaaaaaaaaares!    which allows us to achieve weightlessness for about thirty seconds.  We\'ll do this twenty times      Woooooo! Weightlessness!    so you can get acquainted with the sensation of being weightless.  It takes some time getting used to, but      Ow.  Agent Kane.  Are you alright? Yep.  Yep yep yep.  What is going on with you? Do not like.  What\'re you, crazy? What\'s not to    Oh.  No! Archer, noooo! Yeesss! Please don\'t do this! What\'s that? Sorry, I couldn\'t hear you over the sound of the vawshiiiit! Looking good! Only nineteen more to go! Nineteen more times Until there was literally no more fluid left in my body.  Yeah, and thanks so much for that.    Cyril   She\'s not the one who kept riding you into it holding your mouth open.    Jeez, even in zero gravity you\'re an assho      You were saying? To the wet towel wielding survivor of fifteen years of boarding school locker rooms? Wait, fifteen? Or    whatever, the normal number.  Twelve?! Yes, we will launch in twelve hours.  We received another transmission from the Horizon.  They can\'t wait.  But we haven\'t been trained properly! To what, wear a seat belt? Actually, is it a five point harness, or?   I admit this isn\'t an ideal scenario      Speaking of, what\'s the scenario when we get to the Horizon? We don\'t have a tactical plan, we don\'t     We\'ll have plenty of time to discuss our plan of action during the flight.    But      Lana! What has gotten in to you?   More like what got out of her   Sir, I\'m not sure Lana  sorry honey   is physically capable of spaceflight.  Ray! Actually I may not be cut out for it.  I\'m sorry to hear that, Agent Kane Because you\'re going.  To a zone, which is one of danger.  T minus ninety seconds.  Roger, Control, all systems are go.  Next stop, Horizon.  Okay.  Archer.  Sorry, are you talking to me? Or to her, who why is she here?! Because Tony invited me! Tony?! What, you trying to get my mother into the Million Mile High Club?! Sterling!   Archer   Would you calm the hell down?! I am calm! And I\'m also outta here! Take your hands off that harness.  Make me! Oh, and just so you know?! She    Can\'t breathe.  Uh, Flight, we\'re showing suit number two with an oh two malfunction.  Double check that, Control, I\'m showing green across the board.  Stand by.  Roger, standing by.  Doo do doooo   Tony, please! He\'ll behave! Won\'t he! Ip.  Excellent Because I won\'t  I can\'t   let anyone jeopardize the success of this mission.  Flight, oh two on suit two is showing normal.  But uh, keep an eye on it.  Oh, I will.    Hooray   Resume countdown, Control.  Roger, Flight.    T minus five four   Exciting, isn\'t it? Three.  Two.  One.  I think it is.  Ignition.  Liftoff.  Just relax, and rely on your training! Which we didn\'t have! Because Phase Two\'s a little rough! Phase Two?! What\'s Phase    Aaaaaaghhhhh! That was Phase Two.  Did not like.  Wait\'ll you see Phase Three.  What? I\'m kidding, there is no Phase Three.  Just a little space humor.  Yeah, funny stuff.  Right? Right, then I want to brief you all on we can expect when we dock with Horizon.  Ugh, can we expect a pharmacy? Lana, it\'s not a strip mall.  Although I assume there\'s a bar? A bar? Or whatever, cantina.  Ah No.  Please pay attention.  We\'ll dock here, move forward on foot toward Horizon\'s bridge, and    Wait, on foot? Horizon has artificial gravity.  See how it spins on its longitudinal axis? Lana, look at it spin.  When we reach the bridge, we\'ll retake control of Horizon.  But we can expect heavy resistance, I\'m sure the mutineers are armed.  With what, slide rules and Tang? The M 41 Mark Two plasma pulse rifle with concussion grenade launcher.  Oh shit! On "kill" mode, the M 41 fires lethal plasma ammunition.  On "stun" it fires an ion pulse.  Similar to an EMP.  And can it be fired with an erection? Ugh.  Archer! Muzzle?! Relax, it\'s on stun Lana.  Careful.  Even on stun it can      Oops.  Clear!   Clear!   Clear! Owwwwwww! Whew! As I was saying, it\'s possible for the EMP to stop a man\'s heart.  So "stun," maybe a bit of a misnomer.    Dammit, Archer   I\'m not the one who was all sweaty! Mr.  Archer, that\'s twice you\'ve jeopardized the success of this mission! There will not be a third! Uh, Flight, we have a problem   Well don\'t look at me   My God, on this trajectory we\'ll miss Horizon! Control, what happened?! Burn rates were good, Flight, uh stand by.  Uh, Flight, we\'re showing that you are grossly overweight.  Oh, for   ! I wouldn\'t say grossly! I would.  I would be well within my rights to jettison both of you into space! Well within them! Malory! However! For uh, numerous reasons   one being this ship can\'t actually do that   I\'ve decided take you with us.  But I want to know how you got aboard.  Whaddya mean, how? Mr.  Ar      Yeah so that safety\'s tricky, huh? Clear!   Clear!   Clear! Owwwwwww!   Awesome   Son of a shitsnackin whore   Mr.  Figgis! Lock that man in the cargo hold.  Who, me? Aye freaking aye.  Ms.  Archer.  In case I need to sterilize something? Get strapped in.  Agent Gillette, monitor this woman\'s vital signs.  Agent Kane, come with me.  I may need some help getting us to Horizon.  So that we don\'t die writhing in agony when we run out of oxygen.  Yeah, been there, no picnic.  Speaking of, great for picnics.  The tofu teriyaki, not so much.  There\'s teriyaki? No! Cyril, c\'mon, lemme out.  No, you jerk! You shoot me in the heart with a space blaster   Wh ?! You\'re still mad about that?! Not to mention whatever idiot reason you had for smuggling Pam on board! You\'re screwin him, aren\'tcha? Whaaaaaaaat? Yes.  No! Because if we don\'t die, for all I care you can rot in there! Cyril?! Cyril! Well good luck fighting a bunch of whatever, space pirates without me.  you, space.  Come on baby, just a few more seconds! Damn it! I don\'t know if that was a long enough burn! Agent Kane, I need a readout! For God\'s sake, woman, Dramamine!   It makes me sleepy   I think we\'re okay, sir! Thank God.  Because we\'re out of fuel.  What?! How are we gonna get back to Earth?! There is fuel.  On Horizon.  Well I didn\'t know that.  The flight computer will dock the ship.  Assemble the boarding party.  Nor was I told there would be a party.  Lana, what\'re you wearing? Bio matrix composite body armor.  Effective against small arms fire.  And we need all the help we can get.  Since there\'s only four of us.  Yeah, that seems kinda few.    Heck, if you need some help, I\'ll      No! We can\'t jeopardize the women! Cough.    Well not you   No, no, no, Agent Kane, I\'m afraid your particular skill set outweighs your    Docking complete.  Is that a ghost? Nope.  Boarding party, into the airlock.  Gravity engaged.  Weapons on stun, fast and hard to the bridge.  And remember, these are mutineers.  Even if they try to say      Suppressing fiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiire! Otherwise.  Just follow me.  And try not to shoot me in the awshit! What the hell.  Is wrong with me? It\'s the artificial gravity! You have to readjust to it!   I\'ll get my inner ear right on that   We don\'t have time for this, they\'re      There they are! Get \'em, get \'em! Drop your weapons! Drop your weapons! Suppressing    So does this run on batteries, or? Fiiiiire! Get some! Get some! We\'re pinned down! Really? You don\'t think I could rock this? Couple things One, I don\'t know what that means.  And two hang on.  Hang on.  Hang on.  Hang on.  And two, you obviously don\'t know what "boarding party" means.  Who am I, sixteenth century female Irish pirate Grinne O\'Malley? Or her sole female descendant! I\'m sorry.  For what? Space blastering me in the frickin tits?! Or tricking me into that fart locker to get blasted into outer goddamn space on the off chance you might wanna bang me!   Both I guess, look      After you blew me off for Katya the big titted cyborg! Littleiss, uh   R2 double D2? Nice.  Thanks, and I\'m sorry, but you gotta let me out, Pam, they\'re fighting space pirates out there! With Cyril! It\'s supposed to fire.  What is wrong with you? And Lana can\'t even stand up! You idiot, just reset the    unghff! Jesus, like a dog in a station wagon.  No, no! We\'re losing the beachhead! They\'re running out of time, Pam!   Oh, alright   That being said quickie? Meh.  Whew! Okay, good luck.  Thanks, normally I\'d say I don\'t need it, but I can barely feel my legs.  I call that the MOAB.  It stands for      I know! What it stands for, I was there, please don\'t say it out loud.  Now if you\'ll excuse me, I need to Kick some space pirate ass! Woooooo! Archer?! Hang on? Yes, Archer, duh.  And if you\'re done doing each other\'s hair, let\'s      Let\'s retake the shiiiiip! Or just run around interrupting people.  Gagh! I\'m hit, I\'m hit! Oh, for    Do I have to do everything? He asked, intending to be facetious! I\'m sorry! I don\'t know what\'s wrong with me! Besides suffering from gigantism?! Shut up.  The bridge! We have to make it to the      The bridge, yes, I heard you! So unless we\'re going the wrong way! Uhh oh.  No, that\'s it right there.  Then shut up! God! Okay, now what? You can un shut up.  The com link, by the door Commander Kellogg? It\'s Drake! Tony?! "Tony?!" Oh my God, am I glad to see you! We couldn\'t have held out much longer! Well, we got here as fast as we could.  My God, you\'re wounded.  Put him here, please, and we\'ll take those   Uh, oh.  Yeah, here you go   Oh dear, are you wounded too?   No, just      Just a little space sickness.  But eventually she\'ll get acclimated.  I    eventually? Yes, she\'s strong, good breeding stock.  Wh ?! Hey! Whoa, Charles Benedict Davenport.  Uh, the father of eugenics.  Seriously guys, read a book.  And two more on the Intrepid, stowaways, almost as good as her.  Two more?! Then we can populate Mars even faster than we\'d hoped!   What?   What? Did you say Mars?! Oh now your ears    wait, why did you say Mars? Don\'t you see? They\'re the mutineers! Welcome to the Danger Zone!Archer, do something! Sure thing, Lana Oh wait, I can\'t, because I left my lightsaber in my other space pants! Don\'t yell at me, this was your idea! What?! Remind me, when was it that I said "Guys, great idea! Let\'s get shangaied to go live on frickin Mars!" Keep moving.  Make meowwwww!   He said meow   Moving, yes, and how can I help you not ever do that again please? Get in there.  In here sounds great.  are the cuffs really necessary? Archer broke both of Wu\'s arms.  He what?! While shouting "woo. " Happy coincidence.  Mr.  Archer, do I have to sedate you?!   Well, I wouldn\'t say no to a drink   Archer? What, you want one?   Okay, can we get two    my tongue says sangria, but my heart says     Archer.    Michelada.    You realize this is kidnapping.  I do, yes.  And do you realize you\'re insane?!   Well he wouldn\'t, by definition     What\'s more insane? Suffering through famine, war, and disease on a dying Earth? Or creating a utopia on Mars? Using me as your, your brood sow?! No, not    well okay yes, technically, but we searched for so long to find the perfect human female specimen! Well that\'s flattering.  Ish.  And with your morphology, your IQ, your medical history How\'d you get my medical records?! Don\'t judge me on the how Until you see the why.  Oh, Kareega san!   I nevah jooja you.    Well your mother sure as hell does! How isn\'t important.    What is important      Is you hired ISIS just so Lana could pump out a bunch of Martian babies?! Only if by "Martian" you mean "born on Mars," not actual alien life forms.  Oh.  Whatever, either way, my point is this whole thing is Lana\'s fault    What?!    and since you obviously don\'t need any more dudes on Mars    Archer! Lana, the penis to your vagina ratio around here is creepy enough already.    So why not let us three go, and      I\'m afraid that\'s impossible    Or just me.     because even if we didn\'t need all the manpower we can get, there\'s no ship to take you back to Earth.    Yeah no, the shuttle, it\'s      It\'s going to push the Horizon into orbit above Mars, to serve as our base while we begin the terraforming.  Which reminds me.  Captain Kellogg, there are three women on the intrepid.  Take a boarding party, and bring them back here to join their friends.  Holy shitspace! Hey guys, we got a problem! Duh! The party\'s starting and this dress makes me look like a whore! Oh, you don\'t look like an whore An idiot, maybe.  Wh ?! Or both.  Yes, a whordiot.  Agent Kane, I    may I call you Lana? You absolutely may not.  Fair enough, but I wish you\'d reconsider.  You\'d be much more comfortable in my quarters.  Ha! You\'ll have to sedate me.  Oh, we wouldn\'t do that.  We need you in peak physical condition for this great undertaking of ours.  All of you.  So wait, are we not doing drinks? Ha! I\'m not helping you terraform Mars! I won\'t move a cup of dirt! Can we at least have beers? Then you can join the um we\'re calling them involuntary laborers. " Involun    wait, you mean slaves?!   Oh now he\'s indignant   Oh please, all you have to do is sit around all day getting laid! Involuntary labor is just a temporary measure! In a few generations, after the colony is established, we\'ll revisit the issue.  In the meantime    You can kiss three fifths of my ass!   Uh, Tony, we\'ve got a problem   Ugh, what now? I\'m on my way.  And the black guy\'s okay with this?! What! Oh for    how was that racist?! It\'s just a temporary measure! I didn\'t say anything.  Hello, uh, miss? This is Commander Kellogg.  I need you to move the locking lever from "manual" to "auto".  "Auto," got it, moving the lever! Uh clunk.  Did that do it?   Did you move the   ?   Boring conversation anyway.  What the hell are you doing? These nutsacks wanna take us to Mars to be baby factories!   Reeally   Wh ? I can\'t go live on Mars! I just rented a summer house!   Reeally   No.  You just    oh whatever, c\'mon, we gotta figure a way out of this!   Or do we   Yes.  No! And why is nobody else wearing a t shirt under their flight suit? Because this thing feels amazing.    I know, right? Like a vagina with a zipper   Ew.  Lana, trust me, this is the only way.  Ugh, alright.  But turn around.  "Turn around. " It\'s not like we haven\'t all seen them before.  Don\'t remind me.  Okay, there.    Although, I guess it has been a long time   Meaning? Nothing, just bet you\'re glad we\'re in reduced gravity.  Well? I didn\'t invent the ravages of time.  Okay Ray, Cyril, get ready.  Lana pretend it\'s five years ago.  wish it was, so I could murder you before we ever dated.  Uh, excuse me? Could I borrow you? No, you cannot borroh oh my God! Yeah, right? Okay, what seems to be the    Oh my eye! Somebody get his goddamn gun!   Oh for the love of     Oww! Dick! Gaargh! My other eye!   I\'m almost certainly blind   Serves you right.  Anybody else hit?   No, I\'m good.    Yeah, me too.  That\'s because you hid Cyril.  Otherwise, I think that all went pretty great.  Right? Really.  Do you not? "Do you not?" Just gimme the damn    T shirt.  Sorry, it\'s been commandeered.  What the hell am I supposed to wear?! Uh maybe this will work.  Ah, I think that totally works.  Stole them from the gift shop.  If you\'re done being an asshole, help me strip this guy so I can    Security breach, pod six.  We gotta move! C\'mon! Lana, let\'s go! Wait! Lemme just get    damn it.  Rrrrr owww! Well now they\'re droopier.  Aww Security breach, pod six.  No no no, now what?! Security breach, pod six.  I heard you! I don\'t care if you have to use a plasma torch, get this door open! Security team, this is Commander Drake! Converge on pod six! You heard him, get this door open.  Sure thing bossman.    Oh my God, for the last time      We can\'t! Fit them off! That\'s what Dad said, when the bank man came out to foreclose on the farm.  And guess how that turned out.  You murdered a banker?! No, we got a loan modification.  You think a bank wants to own a failing dairy farm? With obsolete milkers?   Oh my God, speaking of   They\'re right! Where they\'ve always been! Wait, can she hear us?!   Man, I hope not   Lana?! Guess not.  Will you come on?! Rrgh! Don\'t get me wrong, I\'d still do her.  Oh please, you\'d do name a noun.  No, you look! You look at these, and tell me they\'re not perfect! Now?! Really?! Jesus God, are you that insecure?! No! I\'m not!   Because I\'m      Readyyyyy! Uh, thoughts? Through there! Go! Uh, newp.  Aaaiiim! Why not?! It\'s full of, ugh, garbage an\' shit! You got a better idea?! Well, we could eat a big bowl of Hepatitises A through E Or just run away.  Just because it was my idea, you    guys?! Fiiiiire! Oh shit.  What is taking so long?! Couple things One, I didn\'t invent whatever this door is made of, which is apparently some alloy of adamantium and mithril! And two, not really liking your tone! You idiots! Firing an ion cannon at the future Mother of Mars? Whose idea was that?!   Dave\'s.    Wh ?! Well that\'s great, Dave.  So tell me, if you kill her, who\'s going to bear our Martian children? Trish?! Ew.  Ew! Archer! Sorry, go on, Trish.  We\'ve been locked in here ever since they you idiots took over Horizon.    Tone   Yeah, sorry.  Butt Drake wants to use the Intrepid to push Horizon to Mars! So tell us how we can stop him! Yeah, can Cyril die after shutting down the tractor beam, or? Ugh! The Intrepid is the key to Drake\'s plan, and he and Kellogg are the only ones who can fly it! So why aren\'t you a holes down there?!   Burn.    Cyril! Although, good point Trish.  Okay, to the Intrepid! Let\'s go! Oh, and Trish? With your looks, maybe bitchy\'s not the way to go.  Okay, you\'re the prettiest! Come on! I thought I made myself very clear.    You did, but     Then why! Isn\'t this airlock open?! Dwarven technology.  What was that?! What\'d you say?! Tony, stop! See? Now we just wait for Mr.  Archer to save the day, like he always does.  I don\'t know about "always" but   Are you sure they can\'t get in? Didn\'t you hear him?   He said      Say "dwarven technology" to me again! What the? Stop this at once! We command you! I\'m sorry? Oh wait, we\'re sorry    aren\'t you guys looking for a new Martian queen?   God damn it   Why, yes, and you\'re      Your majesty.  Your majesty, and you are just, so What\'s the word I\'m looking for? Don\'t say whordiot, we hate that.    Majestic!   Right? Now follow me, we got a big list of must haves for the royal palace.  Uh, your wish is my command! Duh.  Seal the door behind me and prepare Horizon for launch.  Next stop, Mars! Okay, you heard him.  Uh, I heard him tell you to do it.  And I\'m telling you to do it! And I\'m telling you that I didn\'t sign up for Animal Farm in space! Wait, there\'s animals? Wh ? No.  Animal Farm? How do you not get that?   Cyril, I know what an animal farm is      Not an animal farm!    and maybe we can, I dunno, stampede a flock of goats down   the hall   Animal Farm! Is a book! No, it isn\'t Lana! It\'s an allegorical novella! About Stalinism! By George Orwell! And spoiler alert, it sucks! Although I was talking about an actual animal farm.  So never mind.  Oh don\'t mind me, ma\'am, just uh adjusting the climate control.  Ooh! Yes! Another palace must have! Now, we heard some mention of babies?   Uh huh   But just to be clear, we don\'t do babies? "Do" as in? "Do" as in tolerate, be around, touch, and definitely as in let them claw their monstery way out of our vagina.  Well, let\'s put a pin in that.  Eww! Wait, put a pin in what? What? What is wrong with you?!   And where are the other two      Right here, spacenuts.  Pamela, stop! Your queen commands you! Oh please, you\'re not fit to be queen of name a place.  Lidsville.  And Drake, you can forget all about your crazy little Martian sex cult! It\'s not    don\'t you people get it?! Earth is doomed! Mankind\'s only hope for survival is to find a new home on Mars, and I\'m the only man alive who can lead us there!   I\'m like, like      Oh, Jesus Christ   Well,   I think a more apt analogy would be Moses, but      Drop your weapon! Make me! No, don\'t make her, c\'mon Pam?!   Pam, shoot.    Mother! Malory! Pam.    And she\'ll do it, too   She\'ll do anything to keep us from the throne which is our birthright! Ew, birth.  Alright! Wh ? No no no! What\'re you doing?! No, no! Even if they kill me, they can never kill our dream!   Mars      Hang on, sorry, one sec.  Drones? You wanna? Thank you, thank you, thanks a lot.  There is no Mars without you, Tony.  I\'m sorry.  Sorry?! You\'re sorry?! You just singlehandedly doomed mankind! Hey, even so, black astronaut, that\'s still pretty huge.  It actually is.  And at least your own mother didn\'t just play chicken with your life! Self burn.  Cyril! Okay, Drake.  You are going to fly us back to Earth, to stand trial for whatever, space piracy.  No man can judge me.    Well, you say that   Mars foreverrrrrr! Aaaaaaaaghhhh! Suppressing fiiiiiiire! I think I got \'em! Did I get \'em?! You did.  You got those two guys, who were just minding their own business Ooh! And also the one remaining person who could fly us back to Earth! A black astronaut, Cyril! That\'s like killing a unicorn! Aw, crapsnacks!   How could this get      Don\'t! Say it! Do not say it! Gone to outer spaaaace, to shoot that dickbag in his faaaace! Hang on, Other Barry.  This is Barry.  Hey, punkin pie! I    whatsat? No, I\'m in London, for    whaaat? Katya, punkin, I promised I\'d stop trying to kill Archer.  Yes, both Barrys promised! What? Wait, what\'s wrong with the sofa we already    ooh, hey, hon? You\'re breaking up.    Doo doo doo doo dooooo   Any worse.  Is what I was gonna say.  Really? Yes.  Oh my God, are you kidding me?! Brrring! Hello, is this airboats? Yeah hi, it\'s me, Spacebot.  What? Oh, just lifting a thousand pounds like it\'s an apple, no big deal Archer! Quit screwing around with the robot and shut the damn airlock already! Five more minutes!   God   What\'s the hurry?   We\'re all going to die up here anyway   We\'re gonna diiiiiie! We\'re not gonna die! Stop crying! And for what it\'s worth, I think you would\'ve made a great Martian queen.  Duh!   Okay   Uh, so Trish? What.    Still with the tone   Okay, the airlock\'s closed! Happy?! So, seriously? None of you guys know how to fly this thing? No! We\'re scientists! We never even trained on the simulator! The simulator! Guys, I can fly us home! I will fly us home! Wait, what is this?! And that?! But right now this?!   He was really good in the simulator   Yeah, right up until he crashed it! Thanks to you and your stupid fire extinguisher!   Right?   Okay, then it\'s settled.  So Trish, Horizon is self sustaining, right?   Duh.    Well then have fun.  Wait wait wait! Nevermind, I\'m sure somebody\'s gonna feed the farm animals.  Cyril, you\'re in command, try not to kill us.  Everybody else, strap in.    Reeeally   I said in! Not on! Oh.  And ew.  And    Malory.  I\'m going into stasis.  Wake me up when we\'re on the ground.  Preferably above seventy second street.  What is that, who\'s got beer? Arrcherrr! Wh ? Come out to plaay yaaay! Barry?! C\'mon out, Archer! I\'d come in, but Who built this door, space dwarves? Okay, Barry! Forgetting, for the moment, how you found me here! You wanna finish this?! I do, yeah.  That\'s why I\'m here.  Not for long, you\'re not! Where do you think you\'re going?! Uh, this place called to kill Barry? Are you    every time y\'all fight he beats you like the redheaded stepchild of a rented mule! No he doesn\'t.  yes, yes he does.  No no, wait! Look look look! Hang on! Here, look, check it out! You can wear this!   Oh my God   Right? Evil cyborg versus Spacebot.  Love it.  This is gonna be    and I hate this word, but    this is gonna be epic!   Hang on I\'ll be right      He can\'t get in here.  So the only reason to go out there, is your ego.  Not just my ego, Lana! Spacebot\'s ego!   And a giant ass whippin   I can take him! Please! We just want to go home!   But, Spacebot   Jesus, think about somebody else for once in your life! And that\'s her saying that.  Exactly.    Domo arigato, Archer Robot o   Uh, Barry? Yo! Let\'s get it on, brotha! I, uh can\'t.  Get it on.    What?!   Maybe next time, sorry.  Hey, don\'t do that, don\'t apologize I mean, if you\'re having a legitimate problem with your vagina that you have between your legs in lieu a penis, I completely understand and you need to deal with that.  Honestly, we can do this again.    Grrrggrrk   Archer? Next time, Barry.    Sterling, I know I may not say this very often      Or ever.  Well congratulations, you ruined it.  But I\'m still very proud of you.    Aww   Ass.  Docking coupler.  Disengaging.  Okay folks.  Next stop, planet Earth! Just try not to kill us all, Cyril! Mother, please! Don\'t listen to her, Cyril, you\'re gonna do great.  Thanks, Archer.    And just for that   What\'re you doing? You\'ll see.  Ignition.  Noooooooooooooooooo! Ha! Now who\'s got a vagina problem!   Me.    Ew.  How am I gonna get home! Fifty meters.  You\'re doing great, Cyril! Almost there almost there! Yeah, so lemme take this baby on in.  What\'re you  ?!   Archer, stop it!   Lemme land it! Archer! You had like, an actual moment of self awareness in space, so    So I deserve to land the goddamn spaceship! Ten meters.  Sink rate, sink rate.  Uh, actually Cyril, It\'s all you buddy? You got it.  Item four.  Until further notice, no more health insurance claims will be accepted.  Awe, c\'mon.  Well don\'t blame me! Yeah, Cyril crashed the damn thing.  Oh come on! Ray, what\'s the big deal?! You already had the chair! Hey, did I tell you guys I got a goat.Okay kids, who wants Manning Coleslaw? And/or an explanation of why that\'s funny.  Sorry, guys, we\'re, um closed, yeah.  Thanks for getting aside from me because we are closed.  Especially now that the door is locked.  And you\'re not really supposed to be back here.  Even if you have a, a   I was gonna say a hairnet.    Bob?   Is everything   Everything\'s fine, we\'re   Closed, Bob   Linda! Take the kids in the back.  Kids, go in the back with your mom.  Not really want.  *** goes Linda, now would you please go in the goddamn back? Well, excuse me, ***.  Look, the hamburger wasn\'t a big seller, so there\'s not much.    But um   We don\'t want money.  We want you.    I\'m sorry?   We are not robbers.  Oh, my god.  Okay, yes, you can rob them, but just please don\'t hurt my family.    We\'re not robbers.    Oh.    Well, then, what do you want?   You.    ***.    Da.  Wh ? No! Ty sukin syn, ISIS shpion! Even if you kill us, more will come, Archer! Khorosho! Ya ih toje zamochu togda! Bob! Oh my God, are you guys okay?! We yeah, we\'re but Bob! Where\'d you learn how to do that?! I I dunno, it was like, instinct.  And were you speaking Russian?! Was I? But I don\'t even know any Russian! Look, the label in his coat has those idiot Russian letters! Why the hell are Russians trying to kill you?! I don\'t know! He called me "Archer," maybe they think I\'m somebody else Somebody who gambles?! When would I gamble, Linda?! The six hours a night I get to sleep?! Because the other eighteen hours, I\'m slaving over this hot ass grill! I didn\'t know it was such a burden Wh ? Of course it\'s a burden! Don\'t get me wrong, I love you guys, but come on I\'ve been here two months, it feels like two trillion eons.  Well if that\'s the way you what are you doing, you\'re not leaving?! Linda, you heard him! Whoever they are, he said they\'d keep coming! You guys aren\'t safe if I\'m around!   But Bobby   No buts.  I\'m not gonna let you guys get hurt.  What I am gonna do, is find out who this Archer jerk is, and why Russian people want him dead.  I\'m also probably gonna do a spa weekend.  Between work and being a stepdad to Gene and Louise and, um anyway, I am just burned out.  So take care, and I\'ll call after I solve this mystery, or whatever.  Oh, and I forgot to tell you the health inspector\'s coming at eight A. M. , so you better break out the purple stuff.  I\'m sorry, I\'m sure I misheard you Sterling has been missing for two months, we\'ve spent God knows how many thousands of dollars and manhours searching for him, and this whole time he\'s just down at the shore flipping hamburgers? You know another kind of burger? Ostrich.  Shut up, they\'re good.    Shut up!   Yes, shut up! Then explain to me if you know where Sterling is.  Was.  Oh, according to our intel, he was tracked down by a KGB hit squad.    Oh my God!   Sorry.  I should have started that with "Archer is fine".  The KGB hit squad Oh my God!   Not so much.    My God!   But, so, where is he now?   At a spa.  According to his um, wife.  His what? Linda.  She said he\'s name was Bob.  He wandered in there in full morning dress Married? The minute they met?   Who does that?   Ostriches.  Son of a He\'s obviously doing this just to get even with me.  Normally, I would agree, but after talking to the wife, I honestly think Archer doesn\'t know he\'s Archer.  How could he not know who he is? Psychogenic retrograde amnesia.  Also known as a fluke statement, sometimes triggered by extreme emotional or psychological stress.    And we all know what caused that!   Yes, his hatred of seeing me happy.  Now take me to that spa! And we\'ll just see how this amnesia holds up against a sudden and quite possibly violent confrontation with his mother.  Ba ba ba ba Bad idea! According to my clinical research on drug induced amnesia Said the fake scientist   Hmm, and what are your parents\' names?   What? Their names are um, uh Damn it, Krieger, did you drug me? You don\'t remember? Wow, memory is such a fragile thing.  And if Archer\'s real identity is exposed to him too suddenly, his mind may reject it permanently.  We have to ease him back into it, like a latex gimp suit.  And how do you suggest we do that? Well, some people use baby powder.  I\'m a firm believer in corn starch.  Not the gimp suit!   Sterling\'s amnesia!   Oh.  Yes, I have a plant.  Plant? Plan.  I\'m serious.  I want it on record that I think this is a terrible plan.  Duly noted and disregarded.  And I expect you to be totally convincing.  As the damsel in distress? Have you ever met a woman less damsel y? Pam.  And it\'s not you I\'m worried about.  It\'s our pathetic villains.  Guys! Fake mustache, yay or nay?   Yay!   Yeah, it works, right? My face isn\'t a naturally villainous like yours, so Here\'s an idea, why don\'t you just saw your goddamn head off? Geez, what\'s up your butt? Nothing is up my butt, Cyril.  Oh, or maybe there is.  I wouldn\'t know.  Because I\'m paralyzed from waist down and it\'s Archer\'s fault! So, getting some mileage on to that, huh? Ugh, now damsel up and get over there.  And remember, you have to pretend you don\'t have a history together.  For the Sour mix? In a margarita? What is this? Auschwitz? I always do.  Like a big brown giraffe.  Uh, or an ostrich.  Remind me why I let you idiots come.  For the free rooms? Cause the only thing you are more than mean is cheap.  Shut up.  And just because you own this place I think I just own the conglomerate that owns the holding company that owns the hotel chain that owns it.  Don\'t even think about screwing up our plan to cure Sterling\'s amnesia.  His what? tequila, cointreau, lime juice, ice, koja salt.  Oh, and sorry about the Auschwitz crack.  That\'s not like me.  I\'ve been under a lot of stress lately.    I\'m not Jewish.    Did I ask for your life story? Excuse me, is this seat taken? Yes.  No.  I mean, um, please, feel free to always do that.    Hi, I\'m Bob.    Lana Kane.  And thanks.  I just need to rest a minute.  I\'ve been on the run, I mean,   on the go, and. .    Wait   You\'re on the run too?   No, I Forget I said that.  It\'s dangerous, and you\'re married.    And   What, this? No, this This is fake, I just wear it to fend off the cougars.  Like her.  She\'s totally checking me out.    Eww.    Ew.  Right? So why are you on the run? Bob, have you ever heard of ISIS? From the Shazam/Isis Hour TV show?   No, the   Remember Shazam? Wait, who\'s the actor that played Billy Batson? Remember, he\'d go   Shazaaaaam!   Arch Bob!   What?   ISIS! Is the International Secret Intelligence Service and I\'m one of, oh, frankly, I\'m their best agent.  And KGB agents are trying to kill me.  Huh.  Me too! Wait, I wonder if it\'s related to your thing.  Wait, why are you at the same spa as me? I, uh Not even the best agent of this pool.  Seriously, how are we both at I think I see a KGB agent! Kiss me! Okay, he\'s gone.    Glad I could help   I could use more help.  But I have to warn you, it could be dangerous.  For you, Lana, I will take the highway right into the danger zo   oh my God! What?! Michael Gray! Was Billy Batson.  On Shazam.  Krieger, I\'m really having second thoughts about your so called plan.  Give it time! This isn\'t "The Flintstones", we can\'t just whang him in the head with a frying pan! How bout a bullet? Burn.  Oh give it a rest, Ironsides.  Burn.  And please! Focus! Sorry, I\'m trying, it\'s just TEC 9\'s are awesome! Wait, how\'d I know these are called TEC 9\'s? Uh, well Remember, ease him into it! Like a Enough! With the gimp suits! Will you shut up?! Sorry.  Sorry, it\'s just I don\'t know what\'s happening, this is all crazy.  I\'m a fry cook, but I know all about guns? Russian spies who think my name is Archer are trying to kill me? I speak Russian? Oh, and plus I\'m a total badass at hand to hand combat? Pff.  No, seriously, I\'m like Chuck Norris esque.  Okay, hit me.  What? Right here, take your best shot.  I\'m not gonna hit you.  Why, is your vagina bothering you? Okay.  I see what you\'re doing.  But I warned you.  Hiiiiii Ya.  I think you literally broke my heart.    Aww   Shut up.  Sorry.  So yeah, wow, maybe I\'m not as good as I thought Duh.  Okay, the first thing we need to do is search the entire spa for An ice machine, totally, yes.  KGB agents.  Specifically these two.  Did you say gay GB?   Aww   Think it\'s the mustache? It\'s not helping.  Well neither are you, so To reiterate! I am paralyzed! Well?! Join a support group! For who, crippled gay hillbilly spies? There\'s a niche.  Alright you two, you\'re on.  So try, against all odds, not to cock it up.  Speaking of, you see the bulge on that towel boy? Man, if I was you I\'d be at this spa twenty five eight.  Yeah, but then I wouldn\'t get to hang out with everybody at work.  You hate everybody at work.  I know.  It\'s the only thing that gets me out of bed every morning.  The hatred.  Yes, Pam.  The hatred.  Man, this spy stuff is awesome, and I bet I\'d be totally awesome at it, so is ISIS hiring, or? No.  What, is it weird because we kissed? That was weird, and also not a real kiss, and also never happening again.  Oh, I get it.  You\'re not into guys.  O. K.  so Just because I don\'t wanna bang you, automatically I\'m a lesbian? Yes, well, that and your Hulk hands.  I do not, have She Hulk, then, whatever, they\'re Arch Bob! What, Jennifer Walters.  Alter ego of She Hulk, what.  KGB agents, twelve o\'clock.  Wh ?

For the last time, assholes, my name is Shazaaaaaaaaaam! How do you not remember that show? So, uh, what\'s the plan here? I don\'t have a plan! Because those guys are the real KGB! What, as opposed to the fake KGB?! Actually yes, and also Fake bullets! What?! Why do we have fake bullets?! Yeah, Krieger! Why do we?! No no no, you don\'t know my Why do you know the KGB guy\'s name?! Ugh, because Bup bup bup bup bup! Gimp suit! Unless oh my God, you\'re KGB! Oh for if I\'m KGB why is the KGB shooting at me?!

You hypocrite cooze, I just watched you eat a whole bag of LSD gummi bears! Right? And I am tripping bear balls! I\'m kidding, Julio, you\'re not fired.  In fact, I\'m making you the new GM.    Aww   General manager?! Of the spa?! No, dipshit, of the entire hotel chain.  Multinational Hotels Incorporated?! Oh.  I guess I don\'t own this place.  Damn it! I have to pay for these rooms.  Well?! Well what?! Why do I feel like no, why do I know that we\'ve done this before! I, uh, we haven\'t, um Yes we have, Lana! Throwing bottle bombs, your tits flopping around Flopping?! Okay, first of all Oh my God, what\'s happening?! It feels like my brain is exploding! Krieger, what\'s happening?! His mind brain is permanently rejecting his real identity! Mind brain? That\'s a thing, shut up.  Uh, Lana?! Linda! Linda? You\'re my wife! Linda! And I am Bob! I am Bob and I make burgers!   On liubit burgery   Eto yego problema.    Burger Bob, Bob Bob burger burger   Dosvidaniya, Archer Bob, honey, I need you to get down! Yes, down to the store for cheese! For the mile Gorgonzola Burger! Okay, I have had it.  Well, not with j\'accuse cumbers! Ogon\'! Oww! What the shit, Lana?! Archer? Wait, are you you? Yes, I\'m me! You dumb idiot! There goes the frying pan theory.  Who did you think I was?!   You, unfortunately   Unfortunately?! What\'s unfortunate is you got me into a firefight with the KGB armed with a frickin cap gun! Because unfortunately, we were trying to cure your Psychogenic retrograde amnesia! Duh! Wait, so you remember you had amnesia?   Such a fragile mystery   Krieger, one more word and I\'ll make you wish they never scraped you out of Hitler\'s drawers.    Aww   Ew.  Ew.  That is a lot creamier than I remembered.  But, you do remember why you ran away from home this time? I\'m a grown man, Lana, I didn\'t run away from home! I carjacked a limo.  From a wedding.  Oh my God, it\'s all coming back to me now What part of this are you not getting?! Core concept? Drive, shitheel! Wh ?! Where is the limo going?! I guess wherever Mr.  Archer said to.  Son of a bitch! Your words.  Burn.  Ruined! Absolutely ruined, because of you! I said I was sorry, Mother!   Happiest day of my life   Wait, wasn\'t that the day I was born? Oww! What\'s in there? Spa buckles? You think that compares to a dream wedding to Ron Cadillac, the biggest Cadillac dealer in New York?! Technically the whole tri state area! Hiya, gang! Oh, Ron! Thank you for coming so quickly! Phrasing, first, boom! Well, in a Cadillac you don\'t have to sacrifice speed for luxury.  That baby\'ll pass anything on the road except a gas station! And how\'s my lady love? Infinitely better now.  I bet, now that you found Sterling! She was just worried sick about you.    Well, not sick   How the heck are ya, son?   Fine, awful, whatever, great   But mostly mortified that he ruined our wedding! Well all\'s well that ends well.  Yeah, I don\'t think it does, though.  No shit.  No, I mean, the KGB found you at a burger joint when you didn\'t even know who you were, then they found you here? How did they do that? I wait, yeah, how\'d they do that? Barry, are we losing our minds? Could be, Other Barry, could be Because even though I can see Archer\'s every frickin move, apparently it\'s impossible to kill that idiot from frickin space! So where are we on the frickin spaceship to get me home?! And I\'m lookin\' your way, Dr.  Simon.    Uh, well   Lemme stop ya right there, in case you were about to say there\'s been a setback.  Because that\'s what Dr.  Benes and Dr.  Hathaway kept saying.  Remember those guys? They were workin\' with you guys on my new spaceship? I murdered them? Eh, probably just a coincidence.  Really.  You\'re going with coincidence.  Yes, Lana, I\'m going with coincidence! Do you think that\'s wise? What the hell is your problem?!Item six.  Yeah, we\'re not done with item five! Well obviously we are, because I just said "item six. " Where the hell\'re we supposed to eat lunch if you close the break room? Wherever you\'d like.  As long as it\'s not Le Cirque, Lutce, Elaine\'s, 21, The Russian Tea Room, or The Palm.  Like we can afford to eat lunch at any of those.  All the better.  Saves us all the embarrassment of my snubbing you.  Malory    And, shut up, it will save me God knows how much on exterminators That break room is disgusting.  A pig wouldn\'t be caught dead in there.  Yeah it would.    Aww, Pigley Two   And you! Mister "I Can Solve Your Ant Problem!" First of all, it\'s Doctor "I Can Solve Your Ant Problem" And second of all, here\'s your refund.  I really thought that would work.  What were you going for, ant strength relative to the size of a human? Shut up.  Everyone shut up, because item six! Talk to Pam today, because somehow, and seemingly impossibly soon, it is once again time for peer reviews.  Yaaayyyy! Ugh, how can you not hate those? I dunno, maybe I\'m the only one who cares about this being an efficient and supportive work environment Maybe you\'re lame.  Maybe you can shut your dick holster.  So see me after, I\'ve got everyone paired off.  Well, except Ms.  Archer.  Wait, why don\'t you have to do it? Well I would if I had a peer in this entire building.  Item seven.  Oh.  You all remember Lucas Troy   Shitbag.    What\'re you talking about, Luke\'s awesome! He\'s a kickass agent, a great wingman, he can drink Ireland under the table back when we were training together we tore it up! Just like his ISIS contract! I trained him for a year, and the minute he\'s worth a damn he goes to work for ODIN?! She said, oversimplifyingly! Wh ?! And so, congratulations to all our new agents, but especially to our highest scoring recruit, Lucas Troy! Way to go Luke! I\'m going to work for ODIN.  He was still awesome.  And my best    Only    shut up, my best friend, Mother, which is why you hated him, because you were jealous of our relationship.    So, you two were in a relationship Wh ? No, not the Ray kind! Meaning? Homosexual, Ray.  So, so obviously.  What\'s not obvious, Mother, is why my best friend, the awesome Luke Troy, is on your stupid agenda! Oh, right, let\'s see here Doo doo doo dooo oh.  He\'s dead.  He\'s what? Dead! Jesus, clean the secretly gay for Lucas Troy out of your ears.  This is crazy, how could Luke be      Gay?   Dead! Lana.  And your little, whatever, gay innuendos don\'t even merit a    Reach around? Owww! Jesus! Ha ha! It\'s just like my birthday party all over again.  Remember? Nooo! Yeah.  Because you weren\'t invited.  Mother, tell me exactly what happened! To lure a black market arms dealer into the open, Troy was posing as a nuclear scientist who had stolen enough uranium for a dirty bomb.  Oh, that is classic Luke the Spook! Hey stupid, here\'s your fake uranium, click, handcuffs, drops mic on stage.  Yes, that was the plan.  But somehow, thanks to what I just assume is ODIN idiocy, Troy acquired real uranium.  Even classic er! The bad guys would obviously bring a Geiger counter! And ten million dollars in bearer bonds.  And when the smoke had cleared, four ODIN agents were dead, and the uranium, the bad guys, and the money had all disappeared.  And so had Troy.  Doesn\'t prove anything.  Oh for    Archer, if it walks like a duck, and quacks like a duck, and murders a bunch of its fellow ducks Then maybe the duck knew there was a mole! Ever think of that?! That maybe there\'s a fox in the henhouse?! A wolf in sheep\'s clothing?! Or one of the other tricky animals?! Well, we\'ll never know.  The plane he escaped in crashed, in Vermont.  What, no, I bet he faked his own death so he can expose the mole! There is no mole, and faked it how? Paging Dr.  Cooper! Dr.  D. B.  Cooper! Lana, he obviously bailed out and    And then landed safely, buried his chute, ran ten miles to the crash site and then strapped himself into the still burning wreckage? That that could be anybody.  Well, anybody with his dental records.  What?! Yes, Sterling, I\'m    actually no, I\'m not sorry.  He was a traitor and a thief, and so I\'m glad he\'s dead.  If he is! Because you\'ve always been insanely jealous of my friends! So if you\'ll excuse me, Mother, I have to go clear the name of an American hero.  Does he seem almost a little too fond of Troy? Yeah, and you know he was gay, right? As a tangerine.  In jean shorts.  But, I thought Troy was already dead.  Because he wants you to think that! But I have a list of all his known aliases, so see if any of them used a passport! Oh, or a credit card! Yeah, like at roughtrade dot net.  Lana, I will hire Kenny Loggins to come here and play an acoustic set while I slap some sense into you.  Pff.  Ray, back me up here.  Luke Troy, yes or no, gayest dude ever.  Uh Dude, what, it was just the tip! Meathead fratboy asshole jock maybe, but no, definitely not gay.  What?! Boom! Sorry.  What.  What?! I knew it! Where is he?! And why don\'t we leave the terrace door open, Woodhouse?! Exactly, because he\'s a frickin lemur! Ray, call me when you find a lead! I\'ll be somewhere in or on top of my building, shooting tranquilizer darts at the world\'s shittiest pet.  Told him when he bought it.  And I\'m telling you these reviews are mandatory, and   since I outrank you   Hang on, lemme check this imaginary list of all the people I report to Doo doo doo doo dooooo Okay.  What the hell is this? This, mustache on a penis, is Rodney.  And since there\'s only one name on this list, you must be Ms.  Archer.  Cleverly disguised as a large man.  Meh heh! He\'s the new, whatever, gun librarian.  Armory supervisor.  Hooray, what\'s with the cage? Oh, some wacky new thing the kids are doing, called inventory control? Ms.  Archer\'s pissed cause a buncha guns and stuff keep going missing Oh, and lemme know if you want a good deal on a gallon of irradiated ants.  Well, whatever.  I need some range time, so just scuttle back into the tiny little domain over which you have power, and get me a thousand rounds of nine mil, wadcutter.  Absolutely.  Just fill out these requisition forms, in triplicate.  Wh ? For a few lousy bullets?! Well one, they\'re excellent bullets   Are you gonna stand there, in what I just assume are two inch lifts, and tell me Archer filled out your stupid forms just to get a tranquilizer gun? No I am not.  Well?! He filled them out to get, doo doo dooooo, two H&K MP five, two thousand rounds ammunition for same, twenty mark two fragmentation grenade Wait a minute Yeah, that lemur is hosed.  Fourteen days survival ration, two night vision goggle, two each arctic camouflage parka and pant, and, doo doo doo doooo, two pairs snowshoe.  Son of a bitch! That phone call was    Loooooooooooooooke! Dude, I knew you faked your death because a mole framed you for stealing that uranium! Dude, that is such a relief, I was worried they turned you against me.  Are you kidding? Dude, bros before apparent threats to national security.  Archer, you sure you\'re up for this? Because this thing it runs deep.  Dude, I love deep Said your mom! Haa! Classic you! Allright, GPS says I\'ll be there in four hours.  Don\'t worry, Luke I\'m coming for you.  What was that? Phrasing.  Nice! Queer! Wait a    oh my God, holy shit! No, Vermont has liquor stores.  Right? Yeah they have to, it sucks there.  Cyril, not now.  What\'s the signal strength on Archer\'s cellphone? The doohickey says he\'s about thirty minutes away.  And my point was, we could\'ve easily done it by now.  And my point, is that pursuing a dangerous rogue agent, isn\'t the optimal time to do peer reviews! Coulda done it ten times by now.  God damn it fine frickin review me! Section one, Team Dynamics.  Question one, "Does employee cooperate with" Oh.  These are all "Strongly Disagree. " You    Pussy! Shut up, it went down wrong.  Said your oh.  Yeah, doesn\'t work there.  Mmmmokay, say "Thanks for coming. " Nooope! No, seriously, if anybody finds out I helped you I\'ll be disavowed.  I know.  Dude, I know.  Thank you.  For? Nope.  God, what a dick.  Said your mom! Boom! Dammit! So easy Okay, I got an El Camino full of rampage here, so what\'s the plan? Right, yes, okay, so, I know it doesn\'t look like much now But it has tons of potential.  As a base of operations while we track down the mole who framed you for murdering your colleagues and selling uranium on the black market? No, asshole.  As a bed and breakfast.    Uhh   Twin Oaks.  You like that? For the name? Twin Oaks? Seriously? Yeah, according to the doohickey it says Archer\'s in that direction    Are you reading it wrong? Within two hundred meters.  I bet you\'re reading it wrong.  Section two, Interpersonal.  "Does employee frequently criticize oth   " Strongly agree.  Somewhat disagree? Somewhat shut up.  Come on, we\'re going on foot, through the woods.  I\'ve got a bad feeling about this.  I know, but imagine it all fixed up! No, yeah, I mean obviously it\'s    It\'s gonna be amazing, dude, look at these floors! That\'s heart of pine! Yeah, so look    Look at this mantelpiece! Mahogany! There\'s another seven! Eight fireplaces, dude, how nuts is that?!   Pretty nuts   Said your mom! Yeahhh so, um, about un framing you for treason and murder Yeah, I dunno, man, it kinda seems like what\'s the point, you know? I don\'t, actually.  C\'mon, there\'s too much evidence!   I mean it\'s all fake, obviously, but   Exactly! Dude, there\'s a mole in your agency! We gotta catch him! But then what? Then there\'s another mole, or a double agent, on and on, it\'s all just secrets and lies, man! Yeah, it\'s espionage.  I can\'t go back to that world, man, I\'m too tired.  Hopefully that\'s just neurological damage from scraping lead paint No, it\'s    Because turning the Munsters\' house into a B&B is an insane response to your situation! It\'d be cheaper to build a brand new house out of actual money! Yeah, I know it\'ll cost a fortune to fix her up, but money\'s not a problem.  Why, wait, why is money not a problem? And my situation, is anyone who could hurt me thinks I\'m already dead.  I    wait, and who was in the plane? Hm? I said who was in the goddamn   No no no no, what the hell?! How could you not see that?! Because I only have two eyes, and they were busy looking for hunters! Why, is it pumpkin season?! Is that a thing?! Archer, were you followed here? Wow, okay, a little insulting.  I think I know how to spot a tail, so    Is your phone on?! Wh ? No! Jesus, what kind of wallpaper are you thinking about? Because how about a textile? Lana, listen.  No, you listen! We\'re    Ha ha haa! Leave it! The voice mailbox of Is full.  Goodbye.  Why is Lana Kane    and is that the geeky little accountant dude?!    attempting to breach my perimeter?! I honestly don\'t know, but why are    you doing that? Because they are a threat .  No they\'re not! To our future together.  Especially not Cyril! He\'s    wait, I\'m sorry, whose future together? Yours and mine, dumbass.  You lost me.  No, Archer, I thought I had   No, yeah, you did.  but then you came back to me.  Don\'t take this the wrong way? But I\'m getting an extremely gay vibe.  Wh ? Jesus, dude, I\'m not gay! I    For other men! Lost me again.  I can\'t really explain it? I mean, you know me, I\'ve banged more hot chicks than I\'ve had hot dinners, but There\'s just something about you.  That makes you gay for me? Well, I don\'t really like that word? Well sorry, I didn\'t invent English.  It\'s more like a singular samesex attraction.    Can I, um, my head\'s kinda spinning   I know, this is a lot to process.  No, literally.  Well, figuratively.    If it was literally   The wineyou drugged the wine? Yeah, sorry, I thought you might freak out when I told you all this.    Pfff, sunnersannable, I\'d do me   And also when I told you I actually did steal the uranium and murder my fellow agents.    You dick   To fund our life together, dude! Which will start right after I go murder your fellow agents.  Way way way way, hang on.  You had same wine, how you not get drug? Coated the inside of the glass.  Heh! Classic you! Well this is a frickin disaster! I know.  When Ron said we were going on a cruise, I almost vomited blood.  No.  Nobody\'s doing their peer reviews! Pam, the word "disaster" implies it\'s something that actually matters.  It matters to me! Well, but you don\'t.  Well then maybe instead of doing my job I\'ll go hang out in Vermont with Luke Troy and all the other assholes! What?! Oops.  Trace Sterling\'s phone, and scramble every available field agent! I want them all converging on his location!   They kinda already are   There\'s only like two of \'em.  So why are these damn peer reviews so hard?! Only like ten people work in this whole goddamn chickenshit outfit! Sorry.  Don\'t be.  It is a chickenshit outfit.  Look, for your information? Blaze orange is the safest color to wear to avoid being accidentally shot at.  What about intentionally shot at?!   Oh man, this is almost too easy   Oh for    seriously?! Yeah, gotta give \'em a head start.  One Sterling Archer, two Sterling Archer Ooh, Sterling Archer Troy.  We can take each other\'s names.  I\'d be    Luuuuke! C\'mon, you\'re not thinking straight! A, you wildly underestimated my liver\'s ability to metabolize toxins! And B, why would you possibly have these? Because I\'m not the idiot who took his idiot clothes off! Just your jacket, c\'mon, I\'m freezing! No! I am gonna give you the worst peer review in the history of them! Hey, Lana! Where\'s Archer?! Did you kill him?! He\'s fine.  Unlike your aim.  Guess you never learned how to shoot, huh? What?! First of all! Shitass! Or take criticism.  Strongly agree.  And from where? Under.  Wear.  What was it we used to call you? Truckasaurus? Cyril? No, it was oh yeah, Spray and Pray! Dammit! We also called you Shirley Temper.  Uh, Cyril? Which, ya know, lame.  But accurate.  Again, unlike your aim.  Which is why I always thought it was weird that you only ever carried two magazines.  Section three, Organization Skills! Cyril! "Employee is often unprepared for important meetings!" Strongly agree! You left your gun in a pile of clothes! Because I had nowhere to put it! And yet you found room for a twentypage wad of Pam\'s stupid peer review! It\'s important to her! Okay, so Don\'t really know what to make of that.  Unless Wait, no, get it out of your head.  Predator only hunts in tropical jungles.  I assume.  And desperately hope.  Dammit! Well?! Have you found Sterling?! Well his phone\'s in this house.  It\'s about twenty miles north of Bennington, so I assume it\'s a B&B.  Well, you would know.  And if you want to keep those teeth, missy, you won\'t suck them at me!   You know   Shut up, have you tried calling him?! Ha ha haa! Leave it! Yes.    The voice mailbox of   You could\'ve just said so, you little    Alright! I swear to God, you people? Just say the word on the nerve gas.  Feel like I owe you a freebie after the whole ant Krieger thing.  I can\'t, go anymore, can\'t do it.  Section Four, Running.  Employee sucks ass at it.  Strongly agree.  Lana?! Little geek dude?! My only regret, is I won\'t, get to turn this in, because it is scathing.  That can\'t possibly, be your only regret.  Well there\'s dating you.  Actually no, that was far and away the best thing that ever happened to me.  So as much as I\'d like to, I don\'t think now\'s an optimal time for that.  Aww, really?   I mean, if you think we have time   Cyril! Ahh! Yeah we don\'t have time! Not for this, dickbrain.  For that.  What, what is oh.  Ohh, okay! But do get naked.  Panties too.  Yeah, they\'re called briefs? Yeah, you\'re a grown man? Yeah, that\'s our Lana.  Let\'s see, so judging from the shell ejection she was firing at What I really hope was not an ent.  Because that is like the last thing we need.  An entmoot.  Oh my God what if I\'m gay for Tolkien? Dude.  Seriously, not that it\'s gonna matter in thirty seconds But what is your problem?   Well, besides Lana ditching me   For what, an entmoot? Ya know, cause she\'s got those big ass tree hands? I\'d have to go with hypothermia.    Well, I know a cure for that   Oh my God, not in my face! Said your mom, BOOM! Sorry, that\'s terrible to hear that right before you What in the hell is? Well, you know what they say.  Big hands Big dick.  Noooooooooo!   Ew.    Gross.  Luke?! Archer?! Shut up, Luke?! Archer? Oh dude, is it bad? There\'s a kind of a lot of blood down there.  Said your mom.  Oh my God, I\'m sorry.  Seriously.  No, for everything.  The uranium, killing my fellow agents, that hobo I set on fire after I paid him to get his teeth drilled to match my dental records? Jesus, the dentist? God damn, dude.  I know.  But I only did it because I wanted us to be together, forever.  Called it.  I\'ve loved you since the day we met.  So mostly I\'m sorry for remember that training mission in the D. R. ? Uh yeah, tap and trace on the Cuban embassy.  Then we got shit housed on mamajuana.  And then you passed out in your room.  Um yeah Well, after you passed out, I    Luke? If you really do love me? You know I do.  Then please don\'t finish that sentence.  Dude.  It\'s my deathbed confession.  C\'mon, I\'m dying.  Well I\'m not, so please, don\'t    After you passed out.  I snuck into your room with a big bottle of suntan oil, put   on some Al Green, and   Noooooooooooooooooooooo! Can we have the radio?Okay, okay, you got it, you got it, you    Good morning, floor.  Good morning asshole smoke alarm! And good morning, medical bills.  Oh, and your friend, crippling debt.  No no no no no no! Good morning, bittersweet memories.  Good morning, bag of the unspeakable.  And good morning to you, Archer The other shitbag in my life! It\'s broken?   Huh?!   The elevator\'s broken?   Huh?!   The elevator.    Huh?!   The elevator! Outta order.  I can see that! Why the hell did you ask? You\'re late.  I    Jesus, sweat much? The elevator\'s broken    No shit.     and once again, you parked that ridiculous car in my space! Well, A, the El Camino is not a car    Truck, whatever! Nor is it a truck, it\'s a   Vehicular hermaphrodite.  Shut up, and B wait, what was B? I dunno, we\'ll say B was "shut up. " And are we done here? I need to go not pack some shoes, since I\'m gonna buy about ten pairs when we get there.  Get where? Roooome! What?! Not for the Morelli thing! I planned that entire operation!   Yes, and you did excellent legwork   But now it requires literal legwork, Ray, like walking, and maybe running.  Although hopefully not running, because I\'ll be in brand new shoes.  That is so unfair! Not as unfair as how laid I\'m gonna get.  Ciao, bella, ho scarpe nuove! Sorry, honey.  Yeah, we\'ll bring you a present.  Oh, blow me.  Why? You couldn\'t feel it! What.    Nothing, I\'m just curious   A bag.  I piss and shit in a plastic bag.  Me too! But actually, I was wondering if you\'d like to walk again.  No, Krieger, because this way I never have to buy new shoes! Yeah, but is that worth it? Robot legs.  No, this has nothing to do with robotics! I\'m talking about bionics! From the Greek for like kickass! Is there a Greek word for "insane"? Yes! I mean I assume there is, but    If you think I\'m gonna let you turn me into some cyborg zombie like Katya    Whoa whoa whoa whoa, no! "Zombie" implies I raised her from the dead.  Oh, then I\'m using it correctly.  No, you\'re not.  For one thing, Katya wasn\'t completely dead.  Just pretty dead?   So pretty   Hello? Hm? Oh, so, nothing a few hundred thousand volts couldn\'t cure.  The human body\'s basically a potato clock.  So, it\'s gonna look like I\'m leaving? But that\'s only because I\'m leaving.  Why won\'t you let me help you?! Besides the fact you\'ll probably kill me?! Yes! Because it\'s wrong! And I may have wandered pretty far from the church, but I do still believe there are some things that only God should do! Like give you an erection?! I\'m assuming you mean "give me the ability to have an erection"? Also, yes.  No! Yes, Lana! We don\'t need a    Rocket launcher, si, molto pronto! Mmmmmmmneeww, not on the pre approved list of equipment for this mission.  The what? The    I heard you! Why\'d you ask? Pre approved by whom?! Oh, now you\'re on my side.  Shut up.  Common enemy.  That\'s how Lana and I started dating.  Shut up.  Pre approved, by whom.  Ms.  Archer.  Wh ? She doesn\'t know what we need! The last time she was in the field they were still using muskets!   Really?   Seriously? No? Look dipshit, my mother obviously doesn\'t know about this stuff, so    So she goes by my personal, professional recommendations.  I\'m gonna need you to repeat that.  I said    No no, shh, after I come back there and pull your tongue out through your    Asshole.    Ew.    Ew.  You\'d need a bulldozer made of acid to get in here.  Ooh, or Spacebot! And if you continue to behave threateningly   You haven\'t seen threateningly.  You\'ll need one to get out of there.  Remember Spacebot? Guys? And so, a small power unit goes here, on your uh, spiny thing, which sends electrical impulses to your muscles and ligaments and stuff, which I will fuse to a vanadium alloy endoskeleton, replacing your current, um, legbones.  I have to say it kind of worries me you don\'t know the names of the actual bones.  Who cares? Zrrp, they\'re in the dumpster.  Ew.  Wait, then all I need is the power unit, not a bunch of vanadium bones! Yeah, but they\'re awesome.  But if you don\'t put everything back where it\'s supposed to go I\'ve already done it twice! There you go, Conway.  Plus when I\'m taking out the old bones I take tons of pictures with my phone.  Oh, well then what could go wrong? Seriously? Sarcastically.  Oh.  Because you could die.  I realize that.    And I\'ll, ya know, sign a release form or whatever   Oh, that\'s not necessary.  Really? No, I mean if, God forbid, the worst happens there\'s lots of dumpsters.  Jesus.  Sure, if he helps.  Whew, okay, so when do we do this? Well, you should already be feeling the effects of the anesthetic The God damn it, Krieger! So whenever my assistants get here.  What\'s up, spaghetti legs? Wait a minute! Yeah, where\'s Carol? Gettin\' that list of shit you wanted.  Thank you! Seriously! What am I, hourly?!   Are you not?   I don\'t know! Move.  Oh, and when I\'m through talking to Malory? I wouldn\'t be surprised if you find yourself out of a job.  I would.  Burn.  Cyril?! Is it Halloween already? I don\'t know! Then why are you dressed like that? Because, duh, I\'m helping Krieger turn Ray into a stupid cyborg.  A what?! But I guess some cyborgs are smart What are you talking about?! Well, you gotta be pretty smart to fool the ol\' Voight Kampff machine.  In Krieger\'s lab?! Anywhere, duh, it\'s portable.  No no no no no! Uh, yes it is.  Yo, Magnum P. U.  I need a lead acid battery, fifty units of plasma, some bolt cutters, and something called a    Defrimbulator? That\'s a made up word.  They\'re all made up.  Mind! Blown!   Yeah, what could go wrong   Ray\'s gonna be a cyborg over my dead body! Or preferably his! But somebody\'s! What could possibly, go, wrrngzzzzzz.  Hey, should I wash my hands? I didn\'t.  Krieger! Krieger! Krieger open this goddamn door! Krieger I am gonna count to one! Oh that\'s right, he hates robots! For the    this! Is a robot! Gillette is a human being! But he won\'t be for long if you don\'t clamp that artery! One! Brett? What in the hell? Were those gunshots?! Oh, who knows with these people, it\'s one calamity after another.  That\'s, yes, exactly, that\'s why you need a nice long relaxing cruise! But I really really really really really don\'t think I\'ll enjoy it.  Sure you will.  Brett?! Archer! What the shit are you doing?! Um, investigating a ballistic anomaly.  C\'mon, walk and talk.  I don\'t even think he\'s on this floor, but idiot Brett still managed to get shot.  Yeah, he\'s the idiot.  Right? You idiot! If I hadn\'t checked the time at that exact second I\'d be dead right now! Which reminds me, Grover Cleveland called, he wants his watch back.  Archer    He left two non consecutive messages.  This was my grandfather\'s, you ass! I\'ll buy you another one! Now how were you holding it, like, exactly! I    I dunno, like this I guess   Okay, sooooo Boom.  C\'mon, this is awesome, it\'s like we\'re the Warren Commission.  Look look look, check it out! It\'s a real magic bullet! Why the hell were you shooting at Krieger\'s door in the first place? Oh shit, right! Brett, this might be some kind of record! So if you can move, don\'t! I gotta go stop him! Stop who?! Whom! Archer! Krieger! He\'s making a gay terminator! Aaaaand yep.  Officially confused.  Yeah, did he mean a terminator of gays? Because Krieger\'s creepy and weird, but he\'s not homophobic, I don\'t think, so he must\'ve meant well, no, aren\'t terminators asexual?   Not when I\'m done with him   C\'mon, how\'s that even supposed to    fit inside another human being? Oh.  That shouldn\'t be doing that.  There we go.  No no no, do it again, do it again, do it a    This man is barely clinging to life, woman! Get a hold of yourself! Sorry.  And then get a hold of your goddamn beer can!   Sorry.  Jeez Ehh   Blood pressure? I\'ll be honest, it\'s not great.  Wh ? I\'m talking about his! Me too.  Since when? Since the the new intelligence, Mother, from Ray, about the mission! That says you need a rocket launcher? Yes! Can I    No.     just sort of interject here, Malory, this is exactly   what I\'m talking about, with the stress   Ron? Seriously, Ron, why aren\'t you at work? Because I spent thirty years building the business so I don\'t have to be! Because I hired good managers! Walk into any one of my six dealerships    Not six Next year it\'ll be seven, sport, we just broke ground in White Plains.  That\'s actually fairly impressive.  You have no idea.  With that city council? Ron this isn\'t a car dealership, it\'s    The same principle! You build it, hire people you trust to manage it    Ha! Yeah, ha.     and then you collect the fruits of their labor! Because don\'t, please, don\'t take this the wrong way, babe   but you\'re not getting any younger.  You said a rocket launcher? I did.  I did say a rocket launcher.  Then give this to whosits.  I will.  I will give this to whosits.  And call me if you ever wanna test drive the new Coupe de Ville.    Well, I just got a new El Camino   Oh, so you\'re all set.  That\'ll hold way more Hispanics and lawnmowers.  Wow.  I know! That\'s why I can never stay mad at him! Right? Wait, why were you mad? Because I think Krieger\'s doing some kinda bionic shit to Ray\'s legs! And Archer, obviously    Would rather see Ray dead! Jeezy P, I mean, besides Barry and Katya, what is his deal with robots? Servant, call an ambulance.  Yessir, right away sir! An ambulance?! He needs emergency surgery.  And even then, it\'ll be a miracle if we can save his testicles.  But what could have caused this?! Mumps? Or who knows.  The important thing is, what are you doing tonight? I    oh! Well, I said I might meet some people at this thing downtown, but it sounded like it\'ll be pretty heavy on Negroes and jazz, so    I happen to love Negroes and jazz.  Oh! Well then I\'ll just get my coat.  And I\'ll wait here? For the ambulance to take your grievously wounded child to the hospital for emergency surgery? Yes, Woodhouse, and then you can go buy some wax for your cross.  Krieger? Oh my God I\'m a little busy right now! Yeah I know, are you cyborging Ray? No? Look, I think it\'s great if you are    Then yes! But I think Archer\'s gonna try to stop you! He\'s kinda freaking out! Let him! That door came off the Graf Spee! To get in here he\'d need    One RPG 7 launcher and two grenades.  As per the note from your mother.  Thank you, uh, sorry, what was your name again? Rodney.  Thank you, asshole.  What in the? Why aren\'t you people on the way to the airport? We may have sort of a, uh, situation.  And what sort would that be?!   This is what I\'m talking about   Ron! If you keep it up, this headache you gave me is going to last for the next three to five nights.  Look, don\'t worry, I can handle it.  But    Let her handle it! She seems capable.  Hey, thanks.  Reminds me of the head mechanic at my dealership in Yonkers.  He\'s a black.  Wow.  I know, and head mechanic! Now c\'mon, babe, let these people do whatever it is you pay them to do, and let\'s go start our weekend.  Alright, but don\'t miss that flight.  God knows how long it takes to check in with a rocket launcher.  Oh, shit! Well calling the airport\'s not gonna help.  Oh, and one last thing, Rodney, when I get back from Rome, you\'re    Hang on oooooone second.  Armory.  Hey will you bring me a present? No.  Mm hm.  Mm hm.  Ooookay.  You were saying? I shit.  Something about an asskicking with handmade Italian shoes? Well, think about it, you\'ve got time.  What do you think you\'re doing? What do you think you\'re doing?! Obtaining armory materiel under false pretenses is a fireable offense! Oh my    I basically just lurch from one fireable offense to the next! Ugh, like the infamous "Luau Incident. " Jesus Christ, how many times do I have to apologize for that?! Once would be nice! No.  Rodney open this door.  Give me that weapon.  Oh.  You mean this rocket launcher? Because I bet it would open the door.  No, that is inadvisable at this time.  Ya know, if I asked it nicely.  I seriously wouldn\'t do that.  Yeah, because you\'re not awesome.  Oh, and what fresh hell is this?! Whatever it is, they can handle it! They can\'t even handle a simple luau!   My God, what they did to that pigBrett?!   Heeelp   Nghhh   Great, now I get to slog my new Delmans through a lake of blood.  I want that all cleaned up before Monday, mister! Do you hear me?! No Because that room is blast proof! Mawp.  Maaaawp.  Mawp.  What the shit was that?! Hopefully the last remaining shred of Archer\'s eardrums.  That crazy son of a    come on! Why is your instinctive response to run toward explosions?! Mmm because I\'m not a giant pussy? Although, somehow, incredibly single.  Wh ?! I go on tons of dates! With who?! Men! Men models! Men who model!    permanent damage to my earballs because you\'re too chickenshit to take your candy ass to the future and smash the defense grid so Skynet    Whoa whoa whoa! Not cool, man! That is not at all cool! Rodney you mind your own dicky beeswax! You got another one in ya? Ew.  I don\'t    Tease.     and I\'m sorry for that one    Don\'t be.     because I\'m just gonna say it, I think it\'s suuuper creepy you get sexually aroused by physical violence.  Well but also emotional violence.  Wow.  Yeah.  That\'s even creepier.  So are you gonna open the damn door? As soon as you give me that weapon.  Wh ? Do you honestly wanna live through the rise of the machines?! Which you won\'t, because no one will?! I    It was rhetorical! So now if you\'ll excuse me I have an entire human race to save.  What is he hey that\'s ISIS property! What this? Yes.  Take me with you! Shut up! Ooh, yeah, even that little bit\'s enough to get the engine revved up.  So Rodneeeeeey Tease!   Jeezy Petes   Cyril what\'re you doing right now? I    Helping me find Archer, where is he?! Super.  Are you calling the airport again? Cyril shut your goddamn mouth! Hey, guess what\'s not a good time? Wait, where?!   Gotta be somewhere in there   Not you! And did you count right?! What, to five? Dicknuts? Krieger! Look, you gotta keep him away from the lab! We\'re almost done, if somebody can find their last beer! I can promise it ain\'t my last.    I mean, I doubt he can find it   God damn it.  I told \'em, I said    Maps! All through the HVAC ducts! Or just at the, whatever, junctions.  I won\'t even waste however much dryerase it\'ll take to write that down.  No, Mother, because you were too busy wasting it on "Fourth of Ju Luau!" But still, see if you can flush him out.  I\'d hate to use the nerve gas.  Do not! Use the nerve gas!   And yet incredibly single   How the hell do we flush him out?   Uh, duh   Huh?! I said, how hot can you make it?   No no no It\'s already happening   Holy shit, already? Yeah, I actually feel pretty good.  How is that possible? It\'s a proprietary blend.  And barring some sort of massive infection    Don\'t look at me, found number six! You should be up and around by Monday.  Well then can I go home? Cause it\'s hot as balls up in here.  The thermostat\'s becoming sentient! Oh God! That\'s how Maximum Overdrive started!   Well I\'d be lying if I said I cared Wh ? Malory, Ray can walk again! Buh duh buh baaaaa! You mean mince?   Ya know   Maybe he can mince to the bank and apply for a twelve thousand dollar loan for a new furnace! Why did you idiots leave it on ninety all weekend?! Your clothes.  Give them to me.  Aaagh! I\'m kidding, obviously, I wouldn\'t be caught dead in a sweater vest.    Now, if you\'ll excuse me   Just like Fourth of Ju Luau Yeah, if you slid a pig under him.Schenectady?! You\'re in Schenectady?! After all your naggy lectures about how I need to stop micro managing ISIS?! You do! And this is macro managing! C\'mon, some things I gotta do myself! Mr.  Archer\'s on line two.  I\'m on the phone! Yeah, duh, line two.  Wh ?   Mother?! Sterling    Don\'t talk, just listen! My cover\'s blown and I need an extraction! Oh my    wait, extraction from where? Montreal, long story, but my money and passport were confiscated, so    So where in Montreal exactly? Uh Like, the GPS coordinates, or    Bienvenue au Casino de Montreal.  Confiscated by whom? A croupier?   No!   Or a herd of Quebecker whores?!   I wouldn\'t say herd   Well, after you get some free penicillin, compliments of the Socialist Republic of Canada    Wait, really?    you can extract yourself, mister!   Mother I don\'t have a passpor       I mean don\'t get me wrong, I respect that, but comparing ISIS to six Cadillac dealerships is like comparing apples to six Cadillac      Ron!   What?! Sterling is stranded at the Montreal Casino with his pockets turned out and    and this is just speculation    some new drug resistant form of V. D.    Reeally   And you\'re in Schenectady.  Again! I\'ll be home tonight! Oh, I know! Because what\'s tonight?! Uh, Tuesday? Night? Box seats! For the opening of "Carmen" at the Met! Babe, c\'mon, I promise, I\'ll be there! Well if you\'re not, you can just not bother coming home at all! I    Trouble on the old hooomfront? Oh for the    eavesdrop much?! Scream into a speakerphone much?   Pam?   What?! You want us to wear earplugs every time you\'re on the damn pho    Ooh, or helmets! It is just idiots, all the way down.  And his money, I get it, that\'s all craps and whores, but his passport? How the hell did he lose his passport? Bekuz, shuddup, bekuz I dunneebit Bekuz I dunnever go homerika, bekuz, shuddup, bekuz je    hic! Je tam!   Tabernac   It\'s my third biggest fear.  He brings home a whore and says "We\'re married!" Oh, and the whore has bangs.  Ugh, thank God I don\'t have to worry about anything like that with Ron.  "Hi, I\'m Ron Cadillac, aka Mr.  Boring. "   Jesus God, what am I doing with   Ron Cadillac! They don\'t make the rules! You do! Well obviously they do make the rules, that\'s why it\'s come to this.  Which is why Ron Cadillac is opting out! And also why Ron Cadillac is gonna swing by Montreal on his way home.  Because Ron Cadillac is frickin epic.  What.  Yes, I\'ll accept the charges.  What.  Carol, hey, shut up, I need you to go down to Western Union and wire me a thousand dollars.  Wow.  Yeah.  No.  Yes! No! Oh for    then just lemme talk to Pam! Absolutely not.  Huh? Because pick any one of an infinite number of reasons!   Yeah, okay, hang on   Mmmmyeah, no, I would, but I can\'t really leave the lab at the moment But I can transfer you No, I seriously thought you were joking.    Yeah, hang on Okay.  Okay! Lemme talk to Lana! Tabernac! You know there is a line?! There\'s gonna be a line at your wake! So shut your poutine hole, and lemme    Lana?! Lana listen, I    Noop.     need you to    Noop.  Stop saying noop! Noop, Archer.  Noop.  And it\'s gonna sound like I\'m hanging up but    Why do you casser le telephone?! Because I\'m out of people to call! Even Woodhouse wouldn\'t help me What do you mean, no?! I basically own you! And I basically own him.  Jesus, this is actually almost depressing.  Need a ride, champ? Although not as depressing as Ron what the hell are you doing here?! Giving you a ride home.  C\'mon, hop in! Did Mother send you? Uh, not exactly, I uh, just thought it\'d give us a chance to uh, bond.  Yeah, don\'t take this the wrong way, Ron, but I\'d rather bond with a C. H. U. D.  Il est la! Il est la! But C. H. U. D. \'s live in New York so let\'s go! What the hell is a chud?! They were people, but then they got splashed with toxic waste.    Aw, that\'s a load of crap   It\'s a movie! But those baby alligators people flush down there, now that\'s    Ron! C\'mon, seriously, at some point I\'m gonna have to take a shit, so    So why didn\'t you go before we left? Not now! In the future! And I won\'t be able to if I\'m thinking about giant alligators rampaging up into my toilet!   Talk about tearing you a new one   For the love of Christ, man! Stop! I meant, stop talking, about assripping sewer gators.  Yeah, I know.  So?! He asked, incredulously! You said you didn\'t have a passport.  So?! He asked, equally incredulously! So that.  Oh.  So? And that\'s not sarcastic incredulity, I honestly wanna hear your thoughts on getting me across.  Why not?! Because what if they check the trunk?! Why would they? Because that\'s exactly their job! Yeah, on the Mexican border! Who the hell\'s gonna sneak in from Canada?! Arctic wolves? And even if you had a passport, what if they checked you for a gun? I    You do have a gun, don\'t you? Yeah, I    Yeah, I, so uh, maybe keep it handy.  What? Wait, why would I    Ron? Ron.  Ron.  Roooooooooooooooooooon! What?! Oh.  Never mind, I got it.  Ron! Let me outta the goddamn trunk! We passed the border an hour ago! Actually more like three hours.  I    well apparently I took a nap! Probably all this carbon dioxide.  It\'s actually monoxide   Whichever! Of carbon\'s many oxides! Just lemme out! I gotta bitch of a headache and a bladder full of bourbon! Just hang on! They always hit me between Schenectady and Albany.  Who hits you?! Uh Those guys.  What the shit! Ron! Yeah, so listen! Remember when I said maybe keep your gun handy?! Yeah, vaguely! Well the thing is    What\'s the thing, Ron?! Oh.  Never mind! Goddammit Ron, keep it straight! Ha ha! Wooooooo! Did you whoa whoa whoa Ron, compensate! I am compensating! No no no no no, look out, you\'re    Overcompensating.  Is what I was gonna say.  Right before I was thrown clear of the vehicle, almost exactly one hundred linear feet.  Gimme a break, huh, that wasn\'t my fault! Yeah no, I mean obviously this was all due to the butterfly effect.    The what      Butterfly effect, ya know, a butterfly in Africa lands on a giraffe\'s nose, the giraffe sneezes, that spooks a gazelle, the gazelle bonks into a rhinoceros, and the rhinoceros blindly stampedes into a phone booth, calls New York somehow and says "Hey go kill this idiot Ron for a suitcase!" Because the rhinoceros speaks English! What\'s in the suitcase, Ron? Why is that in the suitcase, Ron?! What, I should use a plastic bag? Or this new thing called the bank?! Well, it\'s not exactly Clean, money.  No, shit.  No, I\'m serious Name one, just one single favor, that Archer ever did for any of you.  Oh! Oh my God, chlamydia.  Which put me over my deductible, so the rest of that year all my doctor visits were totally free, score!   Wow.    Right? How much did you go to the damn doctor? I dunno, like, a lot I kept getting chlamydia.  Oww! Get! Off! Chlamydiot! Oh, I get it because of the chlamydia.  Oh, and I\'m an idiot.  Because of course you keep getting robbed! Why\'re you driving around with a suitcase full of dirty money?   It\'s kind of a long story   Well we\'ve got all day! Nobody\'s gonna pick us up, we look like The Ballad of the Flim Flam Man.  The what? Guy Owen? Jesus, Ron, read a book.  Maybe between biannual suitcase robberies.  I don\'t know who keeps tipping \'em off.  And anyway, you mean semiannual.  They\'re the same thing! No, biannual means every two years    That\'s biennial! Bi , or semi annual, means every six months! Oh.  Then yeah, biannually.  Or semi.    Speaking of   Manhattan, yes, thank you, and you\'re sure you can get us there by seven? Oh yeah.  Just hop in the back there.  What like, the back back? Yeah, sorry, you\'all can\'t ride in the cab.  Insurance bullshit, compliments of them democratic queers in congress.  Or whomever.  Okay, things are looking up! No no, hey, c\'mon, don\'t do that! You\'re gonna get him in trouble! Ron, nobody\'s gonna miss one beer.  Or the eleven more I\'m gonna drink.  C\'mon, he\'s an independent trucker A small business owner, out here busting his hump to provide for his family I\'m tellin ya, guys like him are the lifeblood of America.  Not to mention he\'s driving us non stop straight to Manhattan.  Exactly, which should take about three hours.  Which equals twelve beers.  Ugh, okay, here\'s your fur coat, from the world\'s farthest away cold storage.  Wh ? Did they tell you to put it in a headlock?! No.  Well?! I don\'t know! They were like, Persian! You lost me.  Cadillac\'s not my real last name.  I    well yeah, I figured the odds on that were pretty huge.  I changed it.  From Kazinsky.  And before I sold cars I stole \'em.  You what?! I mean, this was years and years ago Me, Tony, Donny, Joey and Fat Mike.  That was my crew.  And kiddo, we\'d boost anything on wheels.  Or one time, ya know, not even on wheels.  That was forty five, though, that didn\'t hurt the war effort.  Anyhoo One day it dawns on me, we\'re doin\' all this work, but the guys makin\' the real money own the chop shops So we revised our business model.  For a few years, lemme tell ya kid, we were going gangbusters.  Until one day, I\'m out gettin meatball subs for the crew, and boom.  The cops got all of \'em.  Aw, Fat Mike too? All of \'em.  And they all got twenty years, because not one of \'em, not one of \'em gave me up.  Anyway, I used our stash to buy a legit used car lot, and then my first dealership, and eventually   Six, yeah, got it.    So the money is   The least I can do.  It\'s like back pay, for all the years they lost.  Plus most of it\'s from charging poor saps for that frickin\' undercoating.  Never.  Get the undercoating.  But I still don\'t know who keeps hiring goons to stick me up.  Yes, you do.  What\'re you talking about? Ron, who hasn\'t been complaining about not getting his money? Son of a Fat Mike! Wait\'ll the crew hears this! He\'ll be eatin his meatball subs through a straw.  Wow, and here Mother thinks you are hands down the most boringest man on this entire planet of Earth.  Wh ? She said that?!   I mean   He is hands down the most boringest man on this entire planet of Earth.  Not in those exact words, but   She thinks I\'m boring?! Well not after you tell her you stole a Sherman tank, Master P! No no no, you can never tell her about that! I\'m serious, about any of it! I    None of it! Do you hear me?!   Okay!   That\'s all behind me! I\'m    almost completely legit now! You gotta promise me you\'re not going to tell her! Okay! I promise! Not that I\'ll ever get the chance Hey guys, if that\'s, ya know how you selfidentify.  Wow.  Okay, so Apparently we have stumbled into what I\'m just gonna assume is       some kind of unspeakably rapey snuff film    yep, look at that, there\'s even a craft services table   But my uh   Stepdad.  Mother\'s husband, has to be back in time for the opera, I know, rich people problems, so even though all you guys have bats and pipes and    wow, Shorty over there\'s got a club with lumps on it, kickin it Bedrock style    does anybody have a gun.  Anybody? Gun? Probably looks a little something like this? No? Okay, so I guess just me then.  Now, for various reasons which frankly don\'t concern you, we can\'t call the police, so we\'re just gonna go, but    What?! No no no no no, screw that! Shoot these degenerate pricks! Ron? Starting with C. W.  McCall girl over there!   Ron.    Well at leastkneecap the sonsabitches!   Ron!   What?! What, you outta bullets?! Well, how the hell was I supposed to know?! You saw me shoot the mob guys!   So?!   So it holds a finite number of bullets! It\'s not a frickin phaser! A what? Oh my God! It\'s just like Carol said the old gypsy woman said! Yeah, she said it would be like some freaky parallel universe, where John Waters directed "The Road Warrior"! Uh huh.  Then what, they kill me? No, shut up, that\'s the awesome part! There it is! Look, Ron! The train! I gotta start going to that gypsy.    We\'ll never we can\'t make it   Yes we can! If dammit, if only there was a way to slow them down! Make it rain? What am I, an Indian? Pacman Jones! Oh.  Huh uh! No! Yes, Ron! You don\'t defy the gypsy! What about my crew?! I\'ve been ripped off the last three times! What\'re they supposed to live on?! What\'re they gonna live on if you\'re eaten by tranny bikers?! Ron, look! We\'d already be dead if they weren\'t in disturbingly sexy high heels! Oh, half.  Okay, that\'s still a baller move.  Master P would totally be proud.  Or he\'d release a diss track.  What is it    half the time I don\'t even know what the hell you\'re talking about! Well guess what! Me neither! That son of a    Come on, we\'ve got a train to catch! Diss tracks.  Jesus Christ, why\'d we even fight a war? Ron! What, I\'m serious! So\'s this train, asshole! Oh, I\'m the asshole?!

Rrrrrrngh! C\'mon grab it, grab it!   Well now hang on a second   What\'re you doing?! Thinking about how much I hate it that Mother married you! You don\'t hate it she married me    No, yeah, I    you hate it she married anybody! Cause you want her all to yourself!   What?!   Paging Doctor Bates! Doctor Norman Bates    Hey shut up! And also eww! And    Sterling, please! Oh my God.  Thank you, Sterling.  You\'re welcome, shut up.    Norman Bates.  Ya know   I apologize, that was out of line.  But come on, you gotta admit the relationship you two have is unhealthy.  No, Ron, I don\'t have to admit that, because    Okay, try not to ruin it this time.  Waaaaaaaooof!   Jesus   Yeah, you see how their legs broke? That\'s because they didn\'t use the parachute fall.  Which I don\'t have time to teach you properly, but    Why would you want to? I    because I take pride in my work? Why would you teach it to me it at all?! Oh.  We gotta jump off the train.  RON Wh ?! We just jumped on the train! Yeah, and it\'s going about twenty miles an hour, and there goes a sign for Catskill, so    So it\'ll take six hours to get home.  If we don\'t get rousted by the bulls.  I also don\'t have time to teach you how to speak hobo.  But wait a minute, hang on, why would you want me to make the opera? I dunno, maybe you were right about a few things, and maybe you\'re good for Mother, and maybe shut up before I lose my temper again.    I got a dealership in Catskill   So we grab a Caddy and drive in style.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, we could just make it But it\'s going too fast to jump off! Look at those poles zipping by! No, no, no, don\'t look at the poles! They give you a false perspective! Try and focus on a distant landmark, like    The ground.  Woooooooo! Hey! See how I did that? Ron? Seven thirty! We just might make it! You sure he\'ll be out there? He better be.    Yeah, there he is   Here you go, sir.  I took the liberty of taking in the jacket a bit, and      Woodhouse.    Yessir? Doesn\'t even come close to making up for leaving me stranded in Montreal.  No sir.  So go get ready.  Your punishment will begin when I get back from dropping him off at the opera.  Wait, you think that\'s a good idea? Ron? Look, I know we accidentally bonded a little, but do not tell me how to discipline my servant! I meant dropping me off.    If your mother thinks we\'re all buddy buddy   Yeah, that would drive her insane Sometimes I think I should just run away.  But who would take me in? No one, Woodhouse no one.  And just what in the hell is this? Just dropping off my buddy Ron! Buddy?! Why, how, and since when?! Long story babe, and look, we really gotta hustle if we wanna make that curtain! Yeah, and I gotta go make an old man eat a big bowl of spiderwebs.  See ya buddy! Duh duh duh, duh duh duh duh Duh duh duh, duh duh duh duh Woodhouse, I\'m gonna check that bowl! Good day.Oh for the    We\'re already late, what\'d ya go and start that for? I didn\'t! So, it just spontaneously combusted.  So creepy look, I\'ve got goosebumps.  I\'m sure you do.  What is    is something burning?! No! Maybe you\'re having a stroke! I\'m not having a stroke! That\'s great, Mother, keep those periodic updates coming! Oh shut up.  Hey, Friday happy hour, you guys in? Gimme that.  No no no no no that\'s not       water.  Well what the hell was it?! Grappa.    Aww   No shit, that was like twenty bucks\' worth.  Who drinks a pint of grappa?! Well nobody now, Wendy Wasteful.  So you can buy my first couple of rounds.    Nah, I can\'t, we      No, you can.  I\'m allowing you.    Oh my God, thank you   You\'re welcome.  but we\'ve got dates.  Meaning the fruit of the date palm? Muh huh.  Date dates, dingdong.  With who? Oh, just some handsome firemen I met.  At a warehouse fire.  So c\'mon, let\'s go already! My cooch has cobwebs on it.  Ew.  Krieger, hey, wanna get a drink? Oooooooooooooh, no.    It\'s mushi night, movie and sushi   With oh.  Meaning that\'s tentacle porn.  "Fisherman\'s Wife" and "Fisherman\'s Wife Two:" "The Re Tentacling. " Mother, hey, wanna go get a drink? You know, as a matter of fact, I do.    Oh, okay, uh      And as another matter of fact, I am.  With Ron, in the bar at The Tuntmore.  And if he plays his cards right, he\'ll be wetting a lot more than his    Oww! What is wrong with you?! Well for one thing, tinnitus! Which Yeah, I think it\'s getting worse.  And how do they all have dates, these aren\'t people you date, I\'m who should have a date, I\'m the best at dates.  Hmm, I wonder if Lana has a date.  Yes!   Lana?   Yes!   You heard that?   Yes! Who\'re you, Jaime Sommers? Yes! No seriously, I can barely hear me, are my ears really that messed up? Yes! Yes! Yes! Okay, Jesus, I\'m not deaf, I\'m just    Going to vomit.  I am going to vomit.  Not on my carpet, you\'re not! I    Oh for God\'s sake, get a room! We did.  Shut up, because first of all I don\'t have to explain myself to you, of all people, and       and if you blow that thing again the next time you hear it\'ll be when some whore is giving you a blow job.  Doesn\'t even make sense.  I think she means she\'ll shove it up your    Dickhole, and where did you get that?! Rape prevention class.  Which, turns out, is a not good place to meet women.  No shit.  Yeah, it\'s like their guard is so up, it\'s    Cyril, scotch, where?! Well if you mean my grandfather\'s Glengoolie Blue, you drank it and then puked it into my trash can! Oh my God, Lana I get, she wants to make me jealous, but are you seriously just getting me back for the scotch?! Do you even hear yourself? It honestly kinda comes and goes.  Well, since thanks to you I didn\'t do the former, now we\'re doing the latter.  Cyril, go start the car.    Are you not going     Cyril? Remember the ground rules for this? So carefully negotiated? I will go start the car.    And before you say it      How long\'s it been since you got laid, Lana? That\'s not why I\'m dating Cyril again!   Uh huh, so two      No! Not two years! Ass.  Fourteen months.  So go ahead, laugh.  At what? I was gonna say two weeks.  Two years is Lana, that\'s the    third saddest thing I\'ve heard today.  Pam told me about a little girl who drowned trying to save a puppy.  Jesus what was the second saddest? The puppy drowned too.  But it\'s a close third, I mean don\'t do this, Lana, c\'mon, I\'d be happy to bang you.  Me and anybody who could fog a mirror.  Well before, maybe, but I really think I\'ve changed, Ya know! And or matured! Ha.  No, I\'m serious, with the cancer, and my possible father dying, and um oh my God, the tinnitus?!   Archer   Hang on, should we get that? Get what? Is the phone not? Damn you, tinnitus, you\'re a cruel mistress! But seriously, do you not hear that? Yes, now! It\'s your phone! Oh.  Duh.  Wait please, Lana, c\'mon, you can\'t deny we\'re attracted to each other! So?! So what if all that stuff really has matured me? I know I\'m not perfect, but you have to admit I\'m better! Than? Than I was! And also than Cyril could ever be.    First of all, Cyril      Cheated on you as much as I did, Lana,   and I\'m ten times handsomer than him, so      They\'re the same! Lana, be honest with yourself.  It was actually about ten times worse.  What happened to your idiot voicemail?! I\'m doing this new thing, where now it just rings, drives people crazy.    Oh my God, you have matured   Lana, I have! Just let me prove it! If.  In some crazy parallel universe I agreed to that.  How would you.  By    Jesus, hang on, Woodhouse might be trapped in the dumbwaiter again.  He was in there two days last time.  Your apartment\'s one level, how do you have a dumbwaiter? Goes sideways.  Mmmmmmmmyello? Speaking.  Uh huh.  Uh huh.  Uh huh.  Uh huh.  Uh huh.  Okay, bye.  Yes! Okay, Lana, check you later.  What? What about all that just now? All what just now? About how much you\'ve matured, and how you want to get back together? That\'s what you heard? Wow, your ears are even worse than mine.  Wait, was that even Woodhouse? Nooop! Then who was it?! Yes, my dear Sterling, come for me.  Phrezzing, boom.  Hey, asshole! Thanks.  And oh, my name is Cyril Figgis.  Hey, how\'s it going? Thenk you, they are beautiful.  Sorry about the chocolate, I didn\'t know you were allergic or whatever.  The alkaloids.

What could have happened to him?!   Uhhh   Noooooooooooooooooooo! He is on space station?! But why?! Well, ya know, I hate to say this, but obviously he met someone else.  Sterling.  Pliz.

When Barry gets back she\'ll realize what a dick he is, so she\'ll need somebody to talk to, so enter Sterling Archer, the sensitive friend! What is this, Opposite World? Yeah, right? Oh for    this is not Opposite World.    I think in her mind that mean   God, okay! This is Opposite World! Whew! Um, okay, and since certain people around here may not see how brilliant my plan is,   they\'re gonna need to be    Convinced? I\'m sorry, did you say incapacitated?   Because, Krieger, I can\'t have the     Responsible people? Naysayers! Walk in on you while you\'re helping Barry build a rocket! Barry The Unstoppable Psycho Cyborg.  He\'s not unstoppable anymore!

I just wanna help you finish your new spaceship, why is that weird? Why is that weird    Because my sworn purpose in life is to murder your little buddy Archer? Archer? No way man, I hate that guy! Since when? Since, um, he slept with my girlfriend! Dattara iinoni [I wish. ] Keep it up.  God, that is just classic Archer! Right? I mean, not a huge surprise, from a self centered alcoholic who feels compelled to sleep with every woman he meets because that\'s the only way to fill the emptiness inside where his mother\'s love should    ow! Do what? One sec? What the shit?! What, you said be convin   Convincing! Not deliberately hurtful! Well?! Yo, asshole! What\'re we doing here? Fixing that spaceship, buddy! Looks like it\'s just about done, huh? Yeah, those scientists were pretty resourceful.  Until they all died.  And how did they, um, all die? Oh different ways.  \'kay.  Swift and severe.  The punishment will be swift and severe.  I mean it, Lana, that girl is out of here.  Aww, and right when she was gonna invest ten million dollars in ISIS.  She said that?! Oh my God, that phony prospectus must\'ve worked! Do you think the money\'s in here?! Come on, help me look in these boxes! Malory! What?! Oh.  Dammit.  So yeah Krieger\'s helping Barry finish his rocketship, and when he gets home he can tell you about the other woman.  The what?! Wait, how\'d we get to another woman? Oh my God, do you have proof of this?!   No, I    can probably get some   Oh, Sterling!   If Barry really is cheating on me   And also if I prove it somehow Then he will be dead to me! Because I will kill him with my bare hands! Yeah, or not, since then there\'s no reason for him to come home at all! What\'s that? Nothing, what? Oh, you mean that? Sorry, that\'s just a sympathy boner.  Oww! Woooo! Cyril Figgis strikes again! Status report! Terrible! Wait, what hap    goddammit! What?! Dude, assimilate! Are Mother and Lana still in the vault?

How is that funny? Because I said so.  What\'s this even written on? A bar bill, and just do it.  Forget about actually fixing the rocket.  But what about the robot fight?! And why are you beating on shit?! Because shit is stuck! Dude! It\'s not a frickin tractor! Yeah, that\'s what all the space nerds up here kept saying.  Until Other Barry just couldn\'t stand it anymore.  I    Krieger! Forget the robot fight and just read the damn script! Then upload the audio to the mainframe! Okay, either Barry!

That\'s not me, talking to Barry.  Shh! Classic Archer! That\'s Barry, talking to   Shhhhh! Yeah so listen, Katya asked me to call you Shit.  She\'s wondering why you left.

Hey thanks, Neil deGrasse Tyson! Oooooh, deGrasse Tyson san How the hell did you fix his ship?! I gave you a bunch of gibberish! I may have gone a teeny bit off script? Wh ? What is wrong with you?! With me? Dude, robot fight.    Oh, and Barry said tell you he\'s   I heard him! Okay, I\'ll tell Katya to pack a bag and we\'ll move to, Alaska or somewhere else snowy, where he can\'t track us! Doesn\'t even make sense.  You know what doesn\'t make sense?! The number you have dialed has been disconnected or is    Nooooooooooooooooooo! longer in service.  Goodbye.  Hey, punkin pie! Dun\'t give me your pie of pumpkin, Barry, you are in the big trouble!   I      I told you! I said dun\'t try to kill Sterling and what do you do?! Um, that.  Da.  But I do what you ask me.

Well whatever, look      No.  You look.  When you get home you are going to hev some new ground rules.  Okay, hon? Look, I\'m sorry I lied, but, ya know, I make the rules.    I mean, I am the head of the KGB, so     Hello? Darling, you are breaking up.  Now who do I hev to screw to get a drink around here? Nobody, ma\'am.  Unless you wunt.  And if you do wunt, I ken be buttum.  No problum there.Rat Patrol! God, that was killing me.  So yeah, these exact same jeeps, only with fifty cal machine guns on the back, and the Rat Patrol just tore ass all over North Africa, hassling Rommel.  How did you never see that show? I was probably here, digging this goddamn jeep outta this goddamn sand! Hey don\'t yell at me, I\'m not the idiot who got us stuck! You were driving! So yes, you are exactly the idiot who got us stuck! Well whatever, the Rat Patrol drove through way deeper sand than this.  Ya know Although I think one guy\'s backstory was that he\'d been like, a bootlegger? But Kentucky\'s not all sand duney, so   Can you at least get out of the jeep?! Yes.  Well?! Hang on? But only because taking a dump on Turkmenistan is on my bucket list.  A true citizen of the world.  Right? I mean shut up? Is damn.  Okay, I guess this\'ll have to do.  Noooop! You\'re not using the map for that! Hey, I\'m not the idiot who didn\'t    I mean, I also didn\'t think to bring toilet paper, but I\'m not, ya know An idiot.  Exactly.  Right, because an idiot wouldn\'t wipe his ass with our only map.  No, an idiot would wipe his ass with our only compass.  Wait, which is where?! Who am I, Lewis and or Clark? Archer.  Well the last time I saw it was on the bar in the Athens airport, but    God damn it! Yeah, I doubt it\'s still there.  A sticky fingered people, the Greeks.  Well you\'re not! Using the map! Okay!   Jesus Wh ? Noooo no no no no!   Well it\'s this or the map, so   Great, we\'ll just tell him his money\'s out in the desert covered with shit.  There\'s still ninety five grand in the bag!   And if what\'s his name   Gorbagun Gorbanguly.  Really? Yes, really.  And you can have a hundred.  What? Cyril, since what, Monday, I\'ve had nothing but ouzo and lamb.  C\'mon, I need at least a thousand.  Three hundred.  Oh for    eight hundred! Five.  Seven! Seven, and you dig out the jeep.  Okay, deal.  But I take the map.  No! We just went over    To read! Now c\'mon, hurry up! The lambs are screaming! Hey be careful, there might be snakes! Not even gonna swing at that one.  Ha ha.  I\'m talking about cobras.  What do you know about cobras, Cyril? I know the Caspian cobra, which is indigenous to Turkmenistan, is often light brown with darker ventral bands.  Well goody, you win cobra knowing.  Dukes, it\'s gonna be dark soon.  How far is it? I dunno, I need to look at the    God damn it, Archer! What, I said I needed a thousand! Bet three hundred bucks seems pretty cheap for a map right about nyowwww! So hey, so yeah, did you say light brown with darker whateveral bands? Ventral bands, on    wait, why? Eh.  Just curious.  "Curious" meaning what, exactly? Uh, meaning odd or strange? First of all, Turkmenistan isn\'t   Or how about just sexist and stupi    Enough! Please, we\'ve talked about this, it\'s not even eight thirty.  Let me get settled before you clomp in here in one of your jealous snits.  One of my    wait, whoa, clomp? Yes, Lana, clomp, meaning   I know what clomp means!   Your clompin\' ass oughta know Wh ? Seriously, I bet your downstairs neighbors hate you.  For your information.  The Flatows are always incredibly polite to me.  That\'s because the Flatows think they live under a frickin AT AT.  Zhwizz clonk! Zhwizz clonk! Zhwizz    Okay! Whereas this one, almost impossibly light on her feet.  It\'s like if you\'ve ever seen Jackie Gleason dance.  So, is that a compliment, or    I don\'t see how it possibly could be.  Okay.  Nor do I see how you could possibly think that you\'re at all suited to a covert mission in Turkmenistan.  Why, because I\'m black, or because I\'m a woman? Wh ? Pick one! I mean look, I don\'t want to sound racist, but    But you\'re gonna power through it.  Not about you, about Turkmenistan! Lana, this is a Central Asian, maledominated, xenophobic puppet state whose dictator changed the words for bread and Friday to his dog\'s name.  Gurpgork.  Yes, Gurpgor    how did you know that? Oh my God how did I know that?! Okay.  And all that crazy is sitting on top of an ocean of oil and natural gas.  Making this pipeline crucial to the Russians, which is why we\'re paying Gurbanguly to hinder construction.  Wh ? Wait, so now we\'re paying people to blow up oil pipelines?! See? Another reason I didn\'t send you.  What, the environment?! Of what, this litterbox? Or Western Europe? Because T 72 tanks aren\'t exactly known for their low emissions.  I want it officially on record that I am strongly opposed to this mission.  What record? Aww, can I at least put something in the newsletter? Wh ? You\'re not still doing that?! No? Yes! No! Please! Just pretend I\'m    who\'s your go to movie star, ya know, for    Lorne Greene.    Wow.    Yeah.  Bonanza or Battlestar? Duh.  So, I come to the Ponderosa looking for ranch work, but my chaps get torn and Hop Sing    Ray? Time\'s kind of a factor here.  I am not.  Ever.  Sucking your taint.  Okay, so Cyril Better chapstick it up, buddy.  First of all, not only does sucking out the venom not help the snakebite victim, it can also envenom the    Taint sucker, that\'s you, let\'s go.  And second of all, the venom\'s not there anymore, it\'s pumping through your veins to your heart and brain.  My    well put a tourniquet on me! You can\'t tourniquet the taint.  But    wait is my dick gonna be okay?! Well the danger there is cytotoxins, which can cause severe necrosis.  Nec    so my dick\'s gonna fall off?! Maybe.  Aaagh! But the bigger danger is the neuro and cardiotoxins, which can cause respiratory failure, cardiac arrest    Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaagh! So the most important thing is for you to stay calm.  Ew.    Oh boy   What, that\'s good right? If my body\'s throwing up the poison? It might be.  If you had drunk it.  Jesus H.  Thirst, speaking of Ray, back pocket down there, flask.  Wh ? No, alcohol\'s a vasodilator! It\'s the absolute worst possible thing you can do for a snakebite! Well maybe for regular people.  Cyril, it\'s already full of cobra venom, now\'s not the time for any more chemical changes to my blood! Okay, give it to him.  Wh ? Gimme that! Here, baby.  It\'s half empty! That\'s still way more than you   Just shut up and    Dig.  I\'m not doing super great.  Well I could use some help! I would, but I can\'t feel my hands.  I meant Ray! Who\'s just standing there Ray, dammit, on bionic legs! Oh right.  God damn it, Ray! I forgot! How do you forget you have bionic legs?! I, ya know, are you constantly aware you have regular leg bones?! No, you\'re    Just pick up the goddamn jeep! He said, suddenly all pro bionic.  Okay, on three.  One, two, threeaagh! Ray? What is that, what\'re you doing?!   My back my back my back my back   Are you shitting me?! Bionic legs, and you lifted with your back?! Cyril, my gun\'s in the gear bag, could you hand it to me, please? To use as a signal? Yeah, maybe.  If there\'s any bullets left after I murder both of you.  Wh ? Why me?! It\'s number two on my bucket list.  What\'s number one? Going to one of those things where they make some record breakingly huge kind of food, like a frittata the size of a hockey rink.  And then eating a piece, and then laughing, because I murdered you.  Krieger, I need you to    Krieger, Krieger? Yep! Yep yep yep! Whatever unspeakable thing you\'re doing back there can wait      Well, you say that   Yes I do, and I just did, so come on, I need you in the control room.  Because they should have checked in by now.  So keep trying to reach them on the sat phone, and if that doesn\'t work try to get satellite photos on the next pass.  And not a word of this to anyone, especially    Lanaaa! I thought I heard self righteous clomping.  Can I help you? Funny, I was just gonna ask you that.  No, we\'re fine.  Aren\'t we, Krieger? Yes? So, the mission? Going as planned? Yes, as a matter of fact they just this minute checked in.  All good.  Uh huh.  "Uh huh. " Ugh, have you ever heard such a superior, know it all tone? Oh, you\'re serious? Yes!   No!   Cyril! I can\'t move, Archer\'s Oh.  Well, very nearly dead, so    I\'m not calling for an extraction! Look, just because Lana makes you feel insecure in your masculinity    Mascu    look who\'s talking! Oh for    Cyril, when I was ten years old I killed a bear.  Nuh uh really? With a bow.  And then Daddy made me take a big ol\' bite out of its heart.  Oh my God! That is horrible! No shit, I was bawling my eyes out.  But he kept slapping me until I did it.    Jesus   Seriously.  No wonder you\'re gay.  And Cyril if you call ISIS, I will literally literally, murder you alright.  I\'d rather die than sit through another one of Lana\'s big "I told you so\'s. " At least you get to bang her.  Well, you seem to be feeling better.  Hang on.  Gay vy Crockett, boom, nailed it.  But no, I\'m pretty sure I\'m dying.  So since you\'re too pussy to call for an extraction I\'m digging, I\'m digging! Well wait, hang on.  Because unless I\'m hallucinating There\'s a Landcruiser over there flipping his highbeams at us.  You\'re hallucinating.  Oh.  Well the good news is, we don\'t have to worry about these alligators.  That\'s not actually good news, is it.  No.  No it is not.  Okay later, gator! No no no no no, what is the meaning of this?! I\'m sorry, James Mason! But he just won\'t stop tooting that darn tooter! Mr.  Archer, I\'m afraid I must ask you to cease your insufferable tooting   This instant.  Fine by me.  I hate opera.  Almost as much as I hate hoodies, what the hell\'s going on here? Oh no, not hell, Mr.  Archer, this is    Hey.  Cut rate James Mason.  I got kicked out of Episcopal prep school.  Twice.  So if there is a heaven    Oh, I\'m sorry, nor is this heaven.  Well no, obviously it\'s not heaven    No, it\'s a       because Janis Joplin\'s not giving me a rim job.  Way station, I beg your pardon? Right? Sorry, a cobra bit my taint.    Yes.    I\'m not myself.  Aren\'t you? Are I? Are you, indeed.  Would you like to know who Sterling Archer really is? No? Why not? Why won\'t you guys stand up to Malory with me about blowing up the pipeline? Mmmmmmmmmmmcuz we don\'t give a shit? About the earth?! Oh please, if you really cared you\'d resign, but there\'s no way you ever will because you\'re just counting the days until, her face bloated and yellow from liver failure, she calls you to her deathbed and, in a croaky whisper, explains that Mr.  Archer is totally incompetent and that you, the long suffering Lana Kane, are the only one qualified to run ISIS, and you weep shameful tears, because you know this terrible place is the only true love you will ever know.  Excuse me.    Daaamn   What? Oh my God, was I talking? Who the hell is he talking to?   James Mason   Oh.  Maybe that\'s his Lorne Greene.  James Mason, why are we in Baltimore?! I thought you might like some insight into how you became the man you are.  No, I would absolutely not like some    Sterling Archer, age eighteen. .  The most recruited prep school lacrosse player in America Visiting Baltimore for the weekend, to decide if he will accept a full athletic scholarship to Johns Hopkins.  Whooooo!   Yeah, so we don\'t need to see how   At a stop on the train ride from New York you struck out the major league homerun champion, Slammer Sloan.  Whooooo! Well obviously, I was awesome, but I   Drew the attention of a beautiful woman named Ruth Ann Litzenberger Qui tait, vraiment, une femme fatale.  And who followed you here, to this very hotel in Baltimore,   and sent you a note, to come to her room   Look, seriously    Woooooo! Wait, how did you know I was staying    What\'s going on here? Sterling? Will you be the best there ever was in the game? Wh ?!   Uh   Noooo! Duh.  Yeah, sooo I don\'t know if you\'re deaf or just an asshole or both, but I\'m pretty sure I said I didn\'t wanna see this.  But Sterling, do you not see how the actions of a deeply disturbed woman have profoundly influenced your life? Well obviously! I mean    Oh, you mean my lacrosse career ending because a crazy stalker gut shot me.  Do I? I don\'t know, James Mason! Do you?! Besides, what freakin\' movie is this? What\'s next, Mr.  Gower slaps me deaf?! C\'mon, you\'re all over the road here! Well?! Well what?! I\'m doing the best I can! If that\'s the best you can do    gaagh! Just kill your    gaagh! Wh ? Are you bouncing on purpose?! No, I\'m trying to get Archer to whatever passes for a doctor around here before it\'s too late! Sounds like a plan, James Mason.  And maybe if you shut up I can concentrate on the rowaaaghhhhh! Gaagh! What the shit was that?! A camel.  Well great, now we\'ve both killed a large animal! Drive around it! I, uh don\'t think that\'s an option.  Hey check it out, Fred and Barney, we\'re at the Water Buffalo Lodge! Krieger, any word from Sterling? Yep! Yep yep yep! Well? What did they say? Oh.  I mean nope.  Nope nope nope.  But, ya know, I\'m sure they\'re fine.  Wait, no! I had the right of way! Gaagh! Seriously, I get that you\'re upset but I think I have a pinched nnngghhh! Gaaagh! Now just a darn minute!   We\'re Americ    Hello   Yeah.  Way to not call it in.  I beg your pardon? Yeah, you should.  And I\'m outta here.  I\'m afraid that isn\'t possible.  Oh really? And why is    Comin through! C\'mon, make a hole! Phrasing, boom.  Boom.  Scholarship to Johns Hopkins.  Mmm.  Bit of a moot point though, really, given your SAT scores.  Goodbye, James Mason.  No, you    Mr.  Archer, wait! Please, here! Here\'s forty three hundred dollars, surely that\'s enough for a camel.  Ah, baksheesh! Baksheesh, exactly, but our friend okay, snake is oh, okay, so "Our friend was bitten by a snake" is Ozum jora? Bishlemek gurpgork? Etmek bishlemek gurpgork.  Wh ? No, no! I mean Yok,yok.  No, no! Mr.  Archer, please! You please, cut rate James Mason!   And then shut up, because I\'m going   Home.  Goddammit.  Or what is it? Gurpgork! Ah! Gowushmak eshek gurpgork! Wh ? No! Yok! Not that Gurpgork! Rawr, rawr! Ah, Gurpgork! Patysha alabai! Ah, Gurpgork! Hawa hawa! Gurpgork! Gurpgork.  How\'s it the same word for bread and snake and Friday and that damn dog?! How the hell should I know?! Because you have an entire satellite array at your disposal, you idiot! Yeah, I don\'t actually know how any of this works.  But    That was the fat guy, you killed.  Oh, and just so you know? I do know what true love is, so yeah.  What in God\'s name was that about? She\'d probably ruin the wedding.  Come on, what the hell is this? I thought you\'d like to see something.  I\'ve seen poverty, I\'ve been to oh, how\'s it going in Turkmenistan? Mmmmm, not great.  TURKMENI Cyril, just draw a snake! Oh right.  Okay, uh doo doo doo elliptical head, oblique dorsal scales, symmetric sub caudal scalation, darker ventral bands, obviously okay, here we go.  Wh ? What is wrong with you people?!

C\'mon, this is stupid, I don\'t need to see this, I remember all of it.  Do you?   Yeah   Yeah I mean, that\'s me, I\'m like Six.  I\'m six today, it\'s my birthday.  And your Mother isn\'t home, is she? No, she had to    look, Guatemala\'s democratically elected government wasn\'t gonna overthrow itself.  Mmm.  And with Woodhouse, shall we say, indisposed There was no one to give you a birthday present.    I wait, no, yeah, I got   Derman! Derman gurpgork! Derman gurpgork etmek! No, I don\'t think he can keep bread down No, I think it\'s   Derman is medicine! Derman gurpgork! I think it\'s antivenom! Gimme! Yok, yok! Kop kop kop baksheesh.  Oh.  He wants a lot lot lot of money.  So? We\'ve got ninety five grand! But that\'s for the mission, to    Blow up a frickin oil pipeline? Wait, really? Cyril, what did you think she meant by "hinder construction?" Oh.  Do you ever think maybe we\'re kinda not always a hundred percent of the time doing the right thing? Do you ever shut up and give that man bear twenty five grand so you and I can split the other seventy? Yes, yes I do.  I got a yeah, I got an alligator! Hello, Sterling.  Your mother doesn\'t know I\'m here, but I wanted to bring you a birthday present.  I hope you like alligators.    I do   I did Thank you, sir.  But who are you? Sterling, I am your real father.  Archer? Buck Henry? Oh my God, Cyril! Ray! I know    You\'re okay! Hey, we gave you the antivenom.  Cyril, shut your dickhole.  Jesus, God.  I know who my real father was.  Well? Who was he? Hewasugh Now it\'s gone.  God dammit.Why do I seem annoyed? Let\'s see Instead of savoring this espresso, this cigarette, and the exactly four minutes of free time I have today, I\'m talking to you cockwits.  What else? Oh, tonight I\'m doing a special seating for a bunch of diplomats from the State Department and Albania.  So not only do I have to create a meal out of yogurt and a goddamn sheep\'s head, apparently there\'s been some vague security threat, so my highly trained staff has been infiltrated!   Sorry   By Shithead Squadron.  Just need to grab some menus, for   the camera, why is there a camera? I assume because this restaurant can\'t hold three million viewers? Two point eight.  Because it\'s not promoted properly! This is gonna be televised?! Yeah, the show\'s called Bastard Chef? Mm.  Scuse me.  Thank you, giraffe lady! Anyway, those ISIS idiots are doing security, and for some inexplicable reason they have to do that undercover, so  Whoops.  That\'s probably why I seem annoyed.  Let\'s go Chet, c\'mon, chop chop.  You\'re the one who dropped it, why do I have to clean it up? Because you\'re the garon de cuisine, which means kitchen boy, whereas I am the sous chef, which means shut your face and mop up the damn yogurt.  And why do you get to be sous chef? Because I have fine dining experience! I used to own a restaurant.  It was a burger joint! Cyril? I mean Chet? Archer? She means Randy.  Can I borrow you? Sure, Mitzi.  My name is not Mitzi.  Walk in.  Now.  Yeah, I got time for a quickie.  Wait, a what? Arch    Randy! Whoaaa, whoaaa ungh! You guys can edit that out, right? Yes.  But we won\'t.  So, quick question, do you think it\'s a good idea to be talking to a TV crew when we\'re undercover? Fake names, duh, follow up question, do you know how TV actually works? I    They\'re not gonna broadcast this episode in this restaurant tonight! Wait, are you guys? No, we    Like a closed circuit deal, or? No.  Because come to think of it, I don\'t know how TV actually works either.  How about geopolitics?   Eh   Because if anything goes wrong tonight, US Albanian relations could become even more unstable, so    What the shit?! Speaking of unstable    that guy is a powder keg.  Why is there yogurt frickin\' soup all over my spotless frickin\' kitchen?! Randy did it.  Whoa whoa, first of all, no I didn\'t, and second, these bowls are the worst! Look, they\'re like, totally slipper   Seize, please hold.  Seize, please hold.  Seizepleasehold seizepleasehold! seizepleasehold! Rrrg! What\'re you doing? Well I\'ll tell you what I\'m not doing    Besides your job? My job, is    Answering the damn phone.  A task so simple that if the health department should let me, I\'d have a monkey do it.  Why? No, I was obviously being facetious.  I would never allow a monkey in my restaurant.  Except maybe in the form of an exquisitely prepared entre.  No, I mean you\'re booked solid for Holy shit, the next ten months? So why even bother answering the phone? To tell people they can\'t eat here.  So, to drive people away, basically.  Those people.  That\'s not even the real phone number for reservations.  I\'m sorry? The real number\'s a secret.  Closely guarded by people I deem acceptable.  So, just so I\'m clear, instead of assessing the security needs for tonight, I\'m answering phone calls from people who aren\'t good enough to eat here in the first place.  Yeah, so try to sound apologetic, but not, ya know, overly so.  Seize.  I\'m sorry, we have nothing available for the next ten months.  Mmmkaybye.  Keep trying.  Ugh, why? Besides I said so? They\'re booked.  If I\'d known I couldn\'t get a table I\'d have never agreed to do security! Why do they need security anyway? There was a threat, of some sort, it\'s all rather vague, but when those State Department dweebs see just how good ISIS really is, mark my words one day soon we\'ll be a major player.  What.    No, you know, just   You say that like you believe it.  Wh ? Hey! Get me a table.  Or the fish gets it.  Jesus, what\'s the big deal? That\'s my fish, his name\'s Jermaaaine! Oh.  I thought he was just your food.  Food?! We\'re not making food, people! We are creating cuisine! Food is what a dog eats! Or a tourist! Wait, a dog ate a tourist? What! That was ambiguously worded! Gnfgh! Was that ambiguous?! Why? Are you antagonizing him? Cyril, c\'mon, it\'s my nature.  See? Yeah, kinda! Well how about this?! Gnfgh! Plus he can\'t aim for shit, he\'s pulling everything to the right.  And if you can\'t turn that into promo gold, you should honestly consider suicide.  Hang on, there\'s a bumper.  Now prep, you [BEEEEEP] maggots! And then bleep out [BEEEEEP], since Darlene won\'t let me say that.  But seriously guys, we do have a lot of food to prep, so Uh, the food\'s spalttered all over the wall and floor and Chet here, so    So scoop it into a bowl.  Nobody\'ll know, it\'s Albanian glop, the entre\'s a frickin sheep face.  I value all cultures equally highly.  Should you be smoking in here? Should you be flaming in here?   Ya know   Boom! Bumper! He\'s just such a bastard! Wh ? And that\'s not my name! Yeah, "Child Murderer" shouldn\'t be hyphenated, that makes it seem like he\'s a murderer who\'s also a child.  Actually no, it doesn\'t    Actually yes, it does.  "Publicity whore" isn\'t hyphenated, so why   Why the shit?! Are you maggots! Not prepping?! I    wait, are you doing a bumper? Coming up, on Bastard Chef! Aaaaaagh! Aaaaaaagh! I have seriously never been happier.  Aaaaaagh! Boom, bumper.  Wait, so what\'d Malory say exactly? I    she said "credible threat. " I know, but what kind of credible    Cyr    Chet! I need those onions! Yes, chef! Ha! He has to call me chef.  How and why are you enjoying this? Well for one thing I\'m pretty drunk.  And besides bartending in Polynesia, I\'ve never had a real job, so    Wait, never? Uh oh, when I was ten I asked if I could sell "Grit" door to door, so I could win some of those x ray specs? But Mother said they were fake.  And also that I\'d get raped and murdered.  It is like peeling an onion with you.  Right? Oh wait.  Chet! Onions! Here.  What dish are they going in? Oh eat a dick! That\'s eat a dick, chef! And for a third thing, I think I actually might be good at this.  Okay, yeah, nice technique, Randy.  Thank you, chef.  Want me to prep the \'shrooms? No I got these, you do the aubergines.  Right away, chef.  If Chet gets his incompetent thumb out of his equally incompetent ass! Nice, yes, that is excellent A. B. B. A. B.  Always Be Berating And Belittling.  And you.  Time to lean, time to get your distracting tits off my line.  Hey, is something burning? Oh wait, it\'s you, because you just got burned.  I    oh my God, you admire that dick.  He\'s a master chef, Lana.  Which turns out is not nearly as gay a job as I thought it was.  I mean it\'s no secret agent, but it\'s way above architect.  Speaking, of secret agent, at some point before the restaurant is full of diplomats, I\'d love to go over the   Menu, I know, let\'s    Plan! On going over the menu, yes.  Get child murderer Gilles de Rais in here and I\'ll walk you through it.  Answer the goddamn phone, woman! Seriously, Mitzi, how hard is that? Rrgh! Now nobody\'s picking up! A monkey could do this stupid job! And yet I pay you to do it.  Oh, so now I\'m a monkey?! No, because a monkey   Hoo ooo ooo ooo eee eee eee eee! What is this, Spain? I mean, it is just constant A. B. B. A. B.  Is that supposed to funny? Yes.  And also I think you might have low blood sugar.  And I need you to focus, so we can get Cruella de Vil\'s mom in there a damn table before she kills Jermaine! It\'s immpoossiibllle.  And what\'s so important about a stupid goldfish? Okay A, he\'s not a goldfish, and B   Please don\'t berate me.  Please don\'t make me, and B Tell \'em Thuy! Toi ca voi ban nam ngan! Con ca Jermaine se giet con ca cua ban! Jermaine, Jermaine, Jermaine! Anyhoo, without gettin all into the details, I may or may not owe fourteen thousand dollars to some people you wouldn\'t wanna owe fourteen cents.  I so can\'t relate to that.  Could you try? No.  Could you pretend to try? Yes! Absolutely not.  Absolutely yes, Chet, c\'mon I need the tongues first, and then every bit of meat scraped off those cheeks.  Is that all? You don\'t want the frickin eyeballs?! Oh.    Okay, so the tongues second   I\'m not cutting out their eyeballs! Well not with that, use a melon baller.  I    Ooh! I\'m gonna go make a big pitcher of melon balls.  You want one? No I don\'t want a damn melon ball! Suit yourself.  But trust me, you are gonna want a melon baller.  Okay, what\'s the word, how we doing? Well I\'ve swept the entire place for explosives, and it\'s clear.  That\'s the good news.  The bad news is, if this vague threat is gunmen, we\'ve got ingress points here, here, and You are talking about eggplants.  No Lana, I\'m talking about aubergines.  They\'re the    They\'re the same thing.  Oh.  Then where does auberge fit in? En nulle part, imbcile, parce qu\'un auberge est un petit htel! Ahh, tu parles franais? Ouai.  Then go answer the goddamn phone! Okay, moment of truth, taste test.    Please don\'t B and or B me too hard   Mm! Not bad, Randy, not bad at all! Thank you, chef.  Just needs a little kick in the ass.  Oh, and speaking of, where is Chet? In the walk in, weeping like a child.  Nice! Man, you shoulda been a chef.  Ohh pshaw.  I\'m serious.  I mean, maybe being a secret agent isn\'t your true calling.  Yeah, my Mother says that a lot Oh what, so now I suppose you\'re just going to sit there and pout?! Well I didn\'t get you into this, mister! You got yourself into this! And the clock is ticking, my friend.  So, just so I\'m clear You want me to use this top secret 934 TX telephonic isolator unit, for which you have neither the clearance nor the written permission to even gaze upon, to find all phone numbers associated with this physical address.  Yeah, Gilda Gotrocks here says ritzy joints like Seize have reservation numbers that\'re strictly on the QT.  What is this, Spain? I mean the Thirties? A flagrant violation of my sworn duty, for which my recompense will be, if in fact I heard you correctly Yes, you in fact did, and said recompense will in fact be a handjob.  No.  From her.  Yes! Wh ?! No! Yes! Please! C\'mon, if I don\'t make good on that last fish fight, you\'re gonna find me in a dumpster somewhere way out in Red Hook! Ya know, if you\'re ever in Red Hook snoopin around in random dumpsters.  Great, so it\'s give him a handjob or change up my whole Sunday routine? Um apparently.  Ugh, this is so unfair.    Okay   But I am not spitting in your face.  I    Take it or leave it.  Mmmyello? See how I did that? Just pick up the phone and talk into it? I    And how did you get this number? Which Kennedy.  Because if it\'s Teddy he still owes me for a urinal, so    oh.  Oh.  Yes, absolutely.  Eight o\'clock, table for four, thank you.    Thank yoooooooooooooouaaaagh   Thank you.  Hoo ooo ooo ooo eee eee eee eee! I think I\'m    Ptoo!  in love with you.  And yet I will die alone.  Yeah, probably.  Okay, listen up! Tonight has to go perfectly, because it is wall to wall VIP\'s out there.  We\'ve got the Albanian ambassador and all his little diplomat buddies And also Little Vernie Kennedy, JFK\'s crazy niece or cousin or something.  And then Teddy walks into the library wearing nothing but a whiskey sour! Oh, Teddy.  Such a scamp.  So no screw ups! Now get to work! Talking to you, Gayvid Niven! Oh, eat a di    What was that? Yes, chef! Randy, ready the soup.  I\'ll be out front, favoring the guest of honor with an aperitif and my presence.    And here you are, Mr.  Ambassador   I prefer to be called Your Excellency.  Well, people in hell want ice water.  Ray! What is your problem?! Besides not knowing if I should add an eighteen percent gratuity? Because I can, it\'s a party of six or more, but if they were gonna tip twenty percent, I just hosed myself.  Not to mention US Albanian relations.  So instead of insulting the ambassador, whom we\'re here to protect    Protect him from what? The only threat around here is    Dying of thirst, apparently.  I\'ve been trying to get a table at Seize for months and when I finally do, instead of Casteau\'s world famous risotto, I have to eat sheep face    Wait a minute    so for God\'s sake, the least you can do is keep my wine glass full! Oh my God, it\'s you! You\'re the threat! You couldn\'t get a table so made an anonymous threat and then got ISIS hired to do security! Well that\'s still no excuse for poor service.  Wow.  Okay, you know what? Excuse me! Yes, tell them all about it.  That\'ll do wonders for US Albanian relations.  Bon appetit! Hi, yeah, are you done shouting at my guests in barely passable French? Oui.  Then go help Mincent Price with the    Eighty six soup! Aww man, I\'m frickin starving Here ya go, gang, get in here.  I brought a buncha crackers and jelly.  You promised you\'d stop doing that! They were in my tuxedo from last time! For the love of God, will you    Kicked out in the first act.  Well, we didn\'t have to fight for a cab.  What? Tell Randy, as his final act before I walk back into the kitchen and murder him with his own shoes, to    Fire the entres! Rrrrgh! Yeah, might as well.  Because, Randy    except, of course, for your mother    there is no threat.  Tell that to my tav kosi! The tender flesh of which I\'m now ruining under the broiler, because I have no soup! Ew.  And who\'s fault is that? The    whatever idiot invented those slippery ass bowls! Now get    back here and mop it up, Chet! ChefEat a dick.  A toast! To His Excellency, the Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary of Albania! And to a long, peaceful, and prosperous friendship between his great nation and ours.  Gezuar! Gezuar! While we sit here dying of thirst Hang on, I might have a juice box in    Ron?! Thenk you, chef.  The dolma, the rakia I feel I am home in Albania.  Just wait until you try my tav kosi.  Oooh! Tav kosi is my most fevorit! If you\'ll excuse me, I need to make sure my sous chef hasn\'t ruined it.  It\'s ruined.  No, it\'s actually really good.  Cyril and/or Chet? No, Cyril and Chet are now vegans.  Aww, and just when I thought I couldn\'t hate both of them more.  Now get these entres to the table! Move, maggots, everybody take a tray! Yes, chef! Right away, chef! Not you, Chet.  You look like a dinosaur\'s tampon.  Boom! Bumper! I am just killing it today.    Well finally   Yeah, sorry, we were dealing with this incredibly obnoxious hoax, so So can I at least assume there will be a wine pairing? Mmmm! Chef Rendy, this is the best tav kosi I ever tested! I    grk! Wow, you really do like it.  Your Excellency? He\'s dead! Wait, no, the threat was a hoax! A what?! Lana! Oh my God! Well you can forget about ISIS working for the State Department! Ever! And sir, please, I\'m sure this was just a terrible allergic reaction! Yes! To poison! What?! No, I started with the freshest ingredients, like    Oh my God, the mushrooms! Casteau must\'ve put poison mushrooms in the    Pam! What.  Nothing, here, have mine.  You sure? Pam! Okay, let\'s get Casteau before he    He\'s gone! And also on the phone! Oh Teddy! Ever the scamp! Please, let\'s have dessert and    No time! We have an embassy to close! So that\'s a "no" on the wine pairing? Malory, a man\'s just been murdered.  But how? I mean, we all ate a little.  Or a lot.  You said I could have it! But, if it wasn\'t the food How the hell did he get poisoned? I coated his glass with cyanide, you idiots! For the toast! Ooh, there\'s toast? Give me that.  But chef why?! Six million bucks! Which I\'m gonna use to deficit finance a new show, where I travel, so I can insult people\'s cooking all over the globe! Now there\'s a show I\'d like to    wait, you won\'t get away with this! Well, you say that Oh, and remember when I said you could\'ve been a great chef? Yes? Every morning I make two cooks like you in the toilet.  Why?! Why couldn\'t he let me have the dream?! Why can\'t you let me have some wine? What is this, Spain in the Thirties? And way, way more importantly, who would pay six million dollars just to make ISIS look like idiots? Seriously, for that much money we coulda built a whole new bionic man.  Dun\'t tempt me, Barry.  Boom! Bumper! Nooooooooooooooooooo! Wow, remind me not to piss you off.  Remind yourself! Yes, dear.Now tell me exactly what happened.  You, through some shady deal with the Border Patrol, sent us to south Texas to capture an individual named Moreno   Mexico\'s most notorious coyote   Which is espaol for people smuggler.  Thanks, that\'s    And also for coyote, turns out.  Archer    It\'s a loanword.  Or is it a calque? Why do you always do this? Because I\'m always bored.  Is he    this is totally nerve wracking! How are you bored? ! Don\'t engage him.  Because I\'ve been lying in scorpion piss for two hours, in the sunblasted shithole which is Texas, waiting for a stupid truck stuffed with smallish brown people who just want a job! And probably Mexican cartel gunmen! What\'d I just say? Big whoop, I\'m spooning a Barrett fifty cal.  I could kill a building.  Just put one through the engine block when the truck has to stop.  Please.  This is what he does.  He knows we\'re tense because we\'re normal human beings.  My theory, and I\'m serious, is that he\'s got some rare kind of pervasive developmental disorder, or even undiagnosed atypical autism.  Your uh, mic\'s hot.  I know.  Wow.    Well, here comes the truck   Okay, we\'re in position.  Great, so after we catch him, you can intentionally hurt his feelings.  Okay, first of all    Can I hold the fake baby! Will you man up? ! Kimberly Kevlar? ! Here we go.  Archer, you ready? Hang on Lana, I\'m stacking rocks in order of descending size.  See, right there, that\'s Oye! Mueve el coche! Hi, yeah, we broke down? And    Bueno pues, los traspaso! Don\'t run over us, we have a baby! Oops.  Es un robo! Vaya! Archer! Not talking to you.  Ay! I can do this all day! Since I find repetitive behavior so calming! Jesus Christ, I\'m sorry! Ow! Apologize to my tinnitus! Now hands up, Moreno! It\'s over!   What\'re you    that\'s not Moreno   I am Moreno! Moreno is a woman.  No shit.  I don\'t understand.  If Moreno had surrendered, how did it go so wrong? Uh, well, kinda slowly at first I said slowly! Whoa, hey, ladies, c\'mon! I know the adrenaline\'s still pumping, but let\'s, ya know, de escalate the situation.  Oh for    de escalate your dick.  De    wait.  Escalate shutting up.  Hola, soy Sterling Archer, agente de    De ISIS, no? Wait, how did you    Lana, Mexico gets the news! I think, do you guys, uh, las notcias? Well, here\'s some news   Now this is happening.  I actually have some thoughts on that.  No, you actually    Do, and those thoughts are, how about we let Seor ita? S.  Awesome, Seorita Moreno go, with a stern warning, if she promises never to do this again, maybe over a drink? Hola? Oh shit, I forgot there\'s people in there.  Cyril, open the door, idiot.  Don\'t push me! And do not! Open that door! But    c\'mon, they gotta be roasting.  Well I\'m sorry, but if we let \'em out, then boom! They scatter! To where? ! Uh, our overburdened health care system? Ooh! Or maybe our tax funded government schools, for which   spoiler ahead   they don\'t pay taxes! How is a Lorax blowing treehugger like you anti immigration? ! Because illegal immigration   Exactly! I mean, it\'s not like your ancestors, ya know had papers! Wow.  Cyril I said open the door! And I said don\'t push me! And then very, very suddenly.  Because I couldn\'t hear you! Over the sound! Of now I\'m punching you! Dammit Archer, let him    Oops.  Lana! Have you lost your mind? ! No, just my temper.  Now open the goddamn door.  And Seorita Moreno, you\'re free to go.  Although the appropriate thing would be to buy me a thank you drink.  Uh? What\'re you doing.  What are you doing? ! You almost killed Lana!   Nnghh   No, see, she\'s fine! She\'s not fine, she\'s at least got a concussion! So? You get like, six freebies.  No you don\'t! Yes you do, Cyril, now put it down! You put it down! It\'s over! We are turning Moreno over to the border patrol and taking Lana to a hospital! Can\'t let you do that.  The first part, hospital\'s probably a good idea.  Well, then we\'ll just see what your mother has to say about it! Do not call her, I swear to God I\'ll    wait, hang on, are you wearing kevlar? Yes, because I\'m not an idi    oh no.  Sorry, I know that hurt.  Nnghhhh There, just like "The Defiant Ones. " Now then, I believe there was some mention of a thank you drink? So, just so I\'m clear You expect me to believe that Sterling beat both of you up, then shot Cyril?   Uh   Uh For some haggard Mexican?   I wouldn\'t really describe her as haggard   I would.  Of course you would.  But, shut up, tempers were kinda high, about the illegals in the truck.  Oh who cares about them.  Not Lana.  Still, though, it doesn\'t   Do you mind? ! Yes, it\'s the most stupidest boring job in the whole stupid boring world! But you insist that we do it.  Not right this second! Remind me, Pam, when did Ms.  Archer say she wanted us to shred this crap? You did say right this second.  I said it on Tuesday! Well? ! Well what? ! I actually don\'t have a follow up.  But speaking of, I bet a Mexican would do this for a buck an hour.  Those documents are top secret! You let Pam do it.  Dicknuts.  I\'m just sayin, they work hard as hell, and they work cheap.  Cheap, because they don\'t pay taxes! Thank you! And when did you work with Mexicans? Where do you think milk comes from? How\'s it hangin, Jorge? Bien, Miss Pam.  How are joo? Yeah, I think you\'re ready.  Milk comes from Mexicans? Oh my God, what\'s cereal made from? ! Thank you.  Labor of love.  Well? Then what? I suppose next you\'ll tell me Sterling drove off in the truck with this Mexican woman? Uh, no.  Because if you will recall Archer shot out the engine block And I don\'t think she was the only one he drove off with So where did they all go? And how? Who the hell knows where? ! Although we do have a working theory on how Hey I\'m serious, if I have to pull this car over you will regret it! So share the goddamn Doritos! Yeah, lookin right at you, Lupe.  You want me to look for what? A station wagon! Clean the impending massive heart attack out of your ears.  A station wagon.  In all of Texas.    Yeah, or Arizona, Mexico, New Mexico   Oh my God.  You just got that.  Mmmokay, but that\'s gonna be kind of a needle in a    hey, is that it? ! Oh.  No, it was   Is that it? Is that it? Is that it? Or is it that? Is that it? Alright, point    Wait wait wait wait! Is that it? ! Point taken! Ow! Hey, ya know what? ! Swear to God, you people make me want to pump nerve gas through the vents.  Just say the word.  Krieger! No! Or, nein, or    And how the hell is this our fault?   Rrrnn   She slapped you so hard you died.    No, I think I\'m really dyin   KRIEGER  I know.  Hey, there\'s Archer.  Aaaaaaagh! Ugh, whoever that was, I\'m serious, pretty sure you\'ve got giardia.  I\'m serious, please, thank you, but we need to get back into Mexico.  Solo para reagruparnos! What the hell kind of plan is this? ! Mmm, I dunno if I\'d call it a plan? No one would! We can\'t drive around Texas! What about the border patrol? ! The what? What in the hell? ! Ten eighty, we got a ten eighty! Neat! Puto cabezamierda pendejo cabron! Ow! Ow! I\'m really starting to regret helping you! Wh ? This is the opposite of help! Which no one asked you for anyway! That\'s what makes it so noble! Est loco! Loco, no s.  Tal vez autismo.  Goddammit Chuy I don\'t have autism! I thought if I let you go you\'d at least blow me! Pinche cabezamierda pendejo cabron! You think I am some kind of whore? ! No, but    Chuy, back me up here, was there not, like, a cock hungry vibe? Driver.  Driver.  Driver! Hey guys! Can you escort us to a hospital? I bet at least three of these woman are about to give birth.  Whoa, okay, okay, I\'m pulling ov    We\'re ten fifty we\'re ten fifty! What the shit? ! Who did that? ! Malo, Lupe, muy malo! Oh, plus you are just covered in polvo Dorito! Dis mio, don\'t kill them! What? ! God, what kind of person do you think I am? I really think you might be insane.  That was more of a rhetorical   But I also think you make a big risk, to help some poor people who just want a better life for their family.  And that, to me, is muy admirable.  See? I knew you wanted to blow m    Sorry, that was inappropriate.  Although so was the response.  Drop the weapon! Drop it! Here.  You are crazy! They\'ll kill us! Uh uh, empty.  Wh ? Last warning! Those are three fifty seven, ow, Ruger sixes.  They each fired six.  How did you count them? ! I\'m just super good at that.  Oh my God, maybe I am autistic.  O. K.  ya dirty ass beaner! That\'s it! Qu? ! I\'m sorry, I couldn\'t hear you over the sound of espera, tena algo para esto.  But I\'d like to take this opportunity to apologize for that racial slur.  S? What about the racial profiling? Whatever happened to probable cause? Our probable cause is the border! Which we protect from terrorists? Look, we\'re just doin our job here.  Shittily Two for twelve at that distance? Although, two does seem like plenty.  Mijo, no debes beber.  Really, you learn that in med school? ! Lo siento, Lupe, tengo mucho dolor.  But quit hogging the beads, I\'m sure Marisol and Paz wanna pray.  And these people aren\'t    I mean not to sound racist, but   we all know who the terrorists are   Los musulmanes.  Lupe! C\'mon, you\'re in America now, you just imply it.  Hey, let us go.  You got our first aid kit, the radio outta the truck so you   can monitor the police band   And, not to sound racist again? But how many Mexicans does it take to hook up a car stereo? ! Hey! Well? ! Well what? ! Don\'t actually have a follow up.  But seriously, Chuy, que the hell pasa? I dunno, the police band is working, but now the eight track is not.  Why! Would we need the eight track? !   Oh, that can\'t be good   Basta! Vamonos! We go to hospital! You two! Get your ass off the car! You can\'t just leave us here! We\'re twenty miles away from our last call in! We\'ll die out here! Goddamnit I\'m actually gonna take that back I\'m glad you took the time to fix it.  Eight track was the way to go.  What do you mean "Way to go"? Which you clearly said sarcastically.  I mean, thanks to you, now there might not be any reward money, which I had earmarked for    vital operations.  You were gonna re do your office.  Picture it all sort of pan Asian Mod, and the carpet just a sea of white! But now I\'m stuck with cat puke green.  Because you couldn\'t control Sterling.  Since when is babysitting Archer my job, my God, that\'s exactly my job Which, to belabor the point, you failed.  Now he\'s run off with this old Mexican woman to who knows where! Ewww! Put a shirt on, what is wrong with you? ! Archer! Is what is wrong with me! And not that I care, at all, but have you tried calling him? Please, with those idiot voicemails? Ugh.    Although, it couldn\'t hurt   Hang on, I should get that Now?   Trust me, if you knew my mother   Please, if you knew mine.  But you should not be talking right now.  And he really shouldn\'t be drinkin.  Really? You learn that in med school? That you obviously didn\'t get into? ! I\'m sorry, veterinarian, I\'m in a lot of pain.  I don\'t even know how you\'re alive.  I\'m very strong.  And also very drunk.  Which, paging Doctor D. T.  McShakyhands? Seriously, get your shit together.  Mother?   Listen, I\'m sorry, I take   Equal responsibility, with Lana Wh ? ! But    ow! C\'mon, Katy Hepburn! The stupid Border Patrol shot me, twice, and I could really use a medivac chopper.  I\'m kinda near    hey, where    Goddammit man, pace yourself! See? They just get more and more elaborate, and then it\'s "ha ha beep" and then somehow I\'m the idiot.  What? ! No no no this isn\'t a voi   Smail.  Well, I\'m sure there\'s a lesson in there somewhere, but    ow! Hic! That oughta do \'er.  Gracias a Dis! And to you, doctor! You truly have the gift of healing! Boy, I wish you\'d tell that to the licensing board.  You don\'t even have a vet license? ! Thanks to one petty local politician.  And one petty barn fulla dead horses.  Will you shut up and stitch me up? ! Although if that wasn\'t a prank, and the Border Patrol did shoot him Inappropriate.    Oh he just has to ruin everything   Yeah, so watch   out for dehydration   Thank you, doctor, we will.  And also for internal bleeding.  We    And sepsis.  We    And MRSA.  We    And probably not a bad idea to get him tested for feline AIDS.  We get it! Now can we go already? ! He said, in agony, because the unlicensed vet drank all his tequila! Es mejor, no debes beber.  Lupe, ya tengo una madre! Now go! Thank you, doctor.  Oh, don\'t thank me.  Seriously, I probably did more harm than good, so if there\'s any way to get to one, a medivac chopper wouldn\'t kill him.  Less he got flung up into the blades somehow.    Yeah, that\'d do it   That will do, thank you! I    wait, but two Border Patrol agents are missing, Archer\'s missing, and you want us to do nothing? Yes, just like you\'ve done up to now.  Malory, we    But thank you both for all that you did do.  Which, again, was nothing.  Nothing    I got shot! Any idiot can get shot, Cyril! Ask Brett! Now if you\'ll excuse me, I need to make some calls to see if I can get my son out of this mess.  How\'s it hangin, Grimace? Owww! Why? Why\'s the AC on? That\'s not the AC, it\'s the heat! Then why\'s it so cold?   Porque vas al cielo   Really doubt I\'m going to heaven Well, dying.  No he\'s not!   Well, you say that   We\'ll never make it in time in this crappy car! You need a helicopter! Yeah, I dunno if you heard, but   I don\'t have access to a helicopter.  They do.  C\'mon, we\'re in enough trouble already! With who.    Dammit   You call headquarters, you say an innocent Amer    Republican was shot in a gunfight with some illegals Wh ? No, that\'ll just make you people look worse! No, not worse as in    okay, screw you guys, you know what I meant.  But if they call this in, you\'ll    We will be far away by then.  And besides, what kind of car will the Border Patrol be looking for? A ridiculous lowrider truck with fender flares and louvers and shit? Exacto.  And so, Mr.  Archer, I\'m afraid for us, this is adios.  Adios? Not hasta pronto, or    So, I\'m guessing that\'s a no possible on the blowjob? Adios, lindo.  Well, if that ain\'t a big loada shit Turns out he\'s some kinda spook.  Dude, phrasing! He\'s right here! Don\'t listen to him, you\'re beautiful.  As is whatever you\'re doing, with the, morphine wise.  Keep that coming.  That was my boss\'s boss\'s boss.  He says yer ass gets total immunity! Ha ha! For helping the most notorious coyote in todo Mexico, Mercedes Moreno? ! Mercedes? Vrooom!   Shit, she must be her daughter   Wait, whose daughter? Maria Moreno, dumbass.  She\'s who we\'re after.  Bet she smuggles in a thouzna them sumbitches a year.  But word on the street is, now she\'s expanding! Gonna start bringin em in convoys! And blow me if we can catch her.  Mmm! But if Mercedes isn\'t then why would but oh, hang on a sec.  Dear Sterling.  You probably should not be reading this out loud, bec    Because hopefully you are with the Border Patrol, on the way to a real hospital.  I\'m so sorry you got shot.  And I don\'t know how to tell you this, but we did not meet by accident.  We knew you would be there, Sterling.  Vale vale, ah estan.  Preprate.  We knew your strengths And we also knew your    well, one of your many, many weaknesses.  Por suerte no es Ray Gillette, eh? And then well, you know the rest.  What the mierda! Cuidate, Sterling Archer, te guardar siempre en mi corazn.  But who? ! Oh hang on, there\'s a    P. S. , and as for who    wait, hang on.  Oh, Lupe says she will be praying for you.  And as for who, I hate to be the one to tell you this, but maybe   you know someone who values money   Oh my Mother.  More than their so called principles? So what do you care if it\'s in pesos? Well, actually, no, I was, but then I thought white carpet? Because he wouldn\'t believe what those *** are.  What are you doing? What? Nothing.  I\'m just a hologram.  AnyhooWhat do you think you\'re doing? My job, Lana.  And what part of your job, exactly, is groping my ass? The part that calls for spycraft.  C\'mon, we\'re posing as newlyweds   Yeah, posing.     and I am drunk on nuptial bliss.  You\'re drunk on champagne.  Little column A, little column B.  Mrvit! Fine, but when you take my hand off your lately almost overly ample butt    Odd choice of dying words I don\'t just question your commitment to the mission, Lana, I question your commitment to America.  Instead of feeling me up in the lobby    Wait til we\'re in the room, got it.     what say we focus on the mission: catching the North Koreans who are in New York to buy enriched uranium.  Can\'t we do both? Can\'t you shut up? Can\'t you put a price tag on freedom? I mean you can\'t put a price tag on freedom.  Always never forget that.  Here\'s your key for the honeymoon suite, congratties, and if I could just get a credit card for the room and any incidentals, we\'ll be    Broke, Jesus, the room\'s that much?! Is there a problem? Not if we\'re buying it as a condo.  I may have something a bit more in your price range basement okay? No it\'s not, because as love besotted newlyweds we want the honeymoon suite.  And price range israngeless.  Archer?! Shhh, a few minutes more, darling, and you can have your way with me.    Ugh, I wish   I know.  Soon.  Alrighty, and we are just all set.  Enjoy your stay.  Enjoy your stay? Oh, right, sorry! Enjoy your stay    No no no   Mr.  and Mrs.  Archer! Ughhh, it\'s like my heart\'s being gripped by the icy fingers of some terrifying Ghost of Honeymoon Future.  Lana.  Lana! Lana!! C\'mon, if you don\'t answer I\'m gonna scream as loud as I possibly    What?! I\'m sorry, I meant "Mrs.  Archer. " I heard you.  I apologize, madame, but    For what, Dunkirk? Or that effeminate yet somehow condescending tone?   Damn, I\'m sure my card was in here   Malory, please, allow me No no no, I\'m    Embarrassing yourself, dear.  Thank you, Trudy.  Oh man, this must be killing you! What, the salmonella dripping all over my desk? It\'s lamb, ding dong, not salmon.  I    I\'m talking about Mr.  Archer and Lana! In a deluxe honeymoon suite! Oh for    Pam, they\'re on a mission! Ary position! By now, since I bet they already did all the good ones Rrgh! Pam, they\'re    Ungh ungh ungh ungh ungh ungh ungh ungh ungh ungh ungh ungh ungh.  Want some? I    Psych! Okay, first of all, just shut up.  And second, I trust Lana completely.  Especially with regard to Archer.  She\'d rather have sex with you.  Why, what\'d she say?! And third, Lana\'s pretty satisfied in the old romance department.    And the old accounting department   What\'s that? What\'s that? Well good thing you work at a spy agency! Miss Spy On People! What, I only watched for a second! You need medication, Pam! Pills! Big pills, like they use at the zoo! But we have to go now, the vet comes back from lunch in twenty minutes! Let\'s go, bitches! Tiger tranqs! We are not.  Breaking into the zoo.  To steal tiger tranquilizers.  Cyril, they have all kinds.  And I have to direct deposit the annual bonuses, so if you two could go be crazy and horrible elsewhere? Like the Tuntmore Towers Hotel, where Lana\'s shacked up with Mr.    Archer   Wait, what?! Yeah, we can see if he\'s into all that freaky gender reversal stuff.  That    wait, what?! Cyril.  I watched for more than a second.  I    you    Yeah, let\'s go down there! I own that dump, we can get a suite and totally spy on Mr.  Archer and    Lana! Okay, I\'m going with you.  Yeah whatever, but on the way we\'re    Not swingin by the zoo.  Laaaaame.  What\'s lame, Archer? The fact that we\'re up against at least four highly trained North Korean agents? Or the fact they\'ve all got   Peppercorns, Lana.  Well, I was gonna say Tokarevs and Shpagin 41 submachine guns, but yeah, let\'s go with peppercorns.  Thank you! Because without peppercorns, it\'s not steak au poivre.  It can\'t be.  By like, definition.  Archer, we\'re supposed to be stopping the North Koreans from buying part of a nuclear bomb, not ordering every single item on the room service menu    Just the dinner menu.     pounding two three  hundred dollar bottles of Glengoolie Frickin Blue    Two? I ordered three    then passing out on the bed totally naked, for a    what\'d you call it? Power blackout.  And you\'re welcome.  Yeah thanks, the memory of your bare ass will bring me comfort and warmth during the coming nuclear winter.  Relax, it\'s North Korea.  The nationstate equivalent of the short bus.  Nice.  What\'s nice is this hot tub.  Which get in, before you blow our cover, any more than you already have, by not performing your wifely duties.  Excuse me? You said my card was used at the Tuntmore Towers Hotel? This morning? Hm? Oh yes, I remember now.  Yes, yes, it\'s all fine, mmmmmkaybyebye.  I am literally going to kill him.  Well, figurative    Literally! I\'ll lure him to my condo in Miami, drug his steak au poivre, drive him out to the Everglades, slather him with rancid chicken fat, and then toss him to the gators!   Pretty specific for a hypothetical   Oh, he is going to pay for this.  Literally.  Cyril? Cyril.  Ugh, fine! Then I\'ll do it! Are they doin it?! Are they bangin?! No, Pam, they are not "bangin. " Well these ribs sure as hell are.  Oh my God, right? We should take some to the tigers! And miss these two doin it?   Oh my God, right   Will you hags stop it?! Look, there\'s nothing going on over there! Unless she\'s screaming at him to get it up.  She\'s not    That\'s what she was screamin at you.  Okay, so I watched the whole thing.  Ugh, were you raised in a barn?! No.  I just slept out there a lot.  Sooo, you got an ETA on when you might possibly be ready to help?   Hard to say, really   Chi\'s taking her sweet time here.  Not criticizing, thorough is good.  Look, just gimme ten    Twenty minutes, and    Archer? I don\'t know how long the North Koreans will be out of their room, so while you ladies discuss the pros and cons of a clear coat    You say that like there are cons.  I\'ll go be thorough at my job and plant the Geiger counter, so we know if and when the uranium shows up.  Do you even know if that thing works? Well, Pigley Three, that would certainly explain the glowing And probably a few other things.  Grunt.  Why do you let him push your buttons? Why not push his buttons? Because he has no buttons.  He\'s buttonless.  The only way to make him as crazy as he makes you, is to ha, ha, ha, haaaa.  Seriously Who are you, Van Cliburn? Knock off the tickling and work that shit.  Yeah, right? A baby could    unghh! I\'m sorry, Miss Tunt! Did that hurt?   Yesss   Cyril, they bangin yet? Wh ? No! Actually, Archer\'s alone Lana\'s either in the bathroom or Oh my God! What    The hell is this bullshit?! What?! You say you want clear coat! Yeah, why not? I mean it\'s not like it hasn\'t crossed your mind, and you\'re not getting any younger, so    Lanaaa! Jesus, what?! Is it the Koreans?! Only if they\'re who screwed me out of my bonus! Which would be weird! Your bonus?! If you could even call it that! What\'s yours, is it shitty?! Go online and check your bank account! Now.  When I\'m suction cupped on a window, thirty stories above the ground.  Yeah, you should have five bars.  Okay so, it\'s gonna sound like I\'m hanging up? But    Lana.  Lana! Holy shit, I think she\'s gone rogue! But whoa, don\'t pack up.  My toes aren\'t gonna do themselves.  And even if you\'re not necessarily doing it for the right reasons, he\'s    ARCHER  Hey! Hey! Phone, gimme! Did you seriously climb all the way up here just to see what my bonus is? No, I sarcastically climbed all the way up here to see what your bonus is! He said, sarcastically! Phone! Okay, Jesus! Keep your voice Whoa.  Sucks, right? I mean that\'s not even    remotely fair! What the shit?! Apparently we\'re in a crazy parallel universe, where bonuses are based on merit instead of whether or not you crawled out of your    mother! Lanaaa! Archerrrrr! I\'m comiiiiing! Phrasingboom! Lanaaaa! Aaaaaaaaagh! Wh ?! Woooohoohoohooooo! Ungh!   Oh my God Archer that was   A ninety dollar manicure, I know.  And I couldn\'t care less, but Chi Lana, she worked really hard on it.  Oh man, they gotta bump uglies now! They    wait, what?! Cyril, a near death experience is like, the ultimate aphrodisiac! Penultimate.  The ultimate\'s doing it on top of a tranqed up tiger.    So listen   No you listen, and then shut up    You shut up, I was on the verge of    Dying.  Making a    Stain on the sidewalk.  Decision! So    So since we\'re keeping score for bonus purposes, Lana! In addition to saving your life a gazillion times    Since I started working at ISIS, I\'ve been shot, stabbed, set on fire, poisoned, shot, sexually assaulted, partially chewed, shot, and declared legally dead! Twice on the same day! You said "shot" like three times.  That\'s just by you! Total it\'s more like holy shit, nineteen! And now you get your bonus and mine?! Archer, I didn\'t    Do anything to deserve it! Exactly! And again, excuse me? There is no excuse for you.  Alrighty.  Think I made my decision.  And it is final.  Because I borrowed your credit card?! You didn\'t borrow it, you stole it! Little column A, little column    Be advised! That until   I say otherwise, Mister Stickyfingers   Seriously, does this never dry? Lana is now agent in command! Wait, what? Yeah hang on, you\'re breaking up? So, my first command, as agent IN command, she said commandingly, is    Get in my big ol vagina! I\'m Lana! Okay, you know what? I am outta here! Oh my God, okay, you\'re abandoning the mission to go home and pout?! I\'m not going home, I\'m going down there to kick some Kim Jong Ass! Wh ? No! We\'re doing surveillance! Yeah, which is apparently French for just sitting around on your ass! Yeah, which is why it\'s surprising that you\'re so shitty at it! Wh ? No no no Archer don\'t    Suck so hard! Rrrgh! Okay, c\'mon, we\'re outta here.  What\'re you, nuts? Oh my God there\'s nuts in this?! Ugh, you\'re allergic to penicillin.  Oh right.  Aaand There\'s no penicillin in this    Good, cause I\'m allergic.     because why the hell would there be penicillin in chocolate mousse? God, gross! There\'s moose in this?! Not that kind of moose.    Elk then, whatever, ugh   Look, you two stay if you want, I\'m leaving.  There\'s no point spying on Lana, because I trust her completely.  And also because they\'re not even in there anymore? Little column A, little column B.  You are not jeopardizing this mission! No yeah, that\'s exactly what I\'m doing.  Because your ego needs its own zip code! I meant I won\'t allow you! Allow me?!   I mean please, allow me   ISIS! Unghh! Wow, that\'s gotta hurt, huh? Archer No, obviously it hurts getting Tom Dempsey\'d in   the tits like that   Archer.  But I meant watching me save your ass for the gazillion and one th time.  Archer! She\'s in command.  Oh okay, so I guess you think this is my fault.  You guess? Well I\'m not a mindreader, Lana! Silence! We deal with you soon enough! And by deal with, obviously, he means    Shoot.  I mean, I assume.  And negativity is infectious, by the way.  You\'re the agent in command, Lana, you should be focused on keeping my morale    Hi, excuse me? Could you go ahead and shoot one or both of us now? Also a good leader is never sarcastic.  Oh, we don\'t shoot you! After mission finish, we take you back to glorious Democratic People\'s Republic of Korea! Oh, then do go ahead and shoot us.  Archer! What Lana, it\'s none of those things! Not democratic, not a republic, and definitely not glorious! Jesus,   watch Frontline once in your life   This ISIS camera, yes?   Uh   Yes! And as all North Koreans know, cameras steal your soul, so    It is your Indians who think that! Wow, okay, so since we\'re being racist! Cyril! Don\'t leave, it\'s on! What do you? On as in how on?! On as in on on.  On as in "hot Asian group sex" on   Thricely redundant   Give me those! Oh my God! We\'ve gotta do something! It\'s rosemary mint.  Why? Why did you say that? To lure them closer.  Well it worked.    Yeah, they really hate the Japanese   You better have a plan.  Me? Lana, you\'re agent in command.  Archer? No, I just don\'t wanna step on your    Toes! Gaagh! Nailed it boom! How did you? ARCHER; Do you have any idea how many times I\'ve had to get out of handcuffs?! Lana! Whew! Well, thank God you\'ve been arrested so many times.  Arrested? I    look, whatever, thanks, that was actually pretty impressive.  Well not really, I thought this was the door to the hallway.  Sooo Do you think there\'s thirty stories\' worth of towels in here? C\'mon Figgis, Lana\'s in trouble, so you just gotta man up and ooh! Aw, man am I missing all the hot Asian group action? No, nobody\'s doing anything Well, Lana\'s destroying the toilet.    Join the club   That\'s what you get for eating elk.  Uh, couple things One, we\'ve got about thirty seconds before the door is matchsticks.  Two, you\'re never gonna break that win    What was that? I couldn\'t hear you over the sound of your wrongness.  It\'s okay, I\'ll skip ahead to three, which is now what, idiot?! Because I left my jetpack in my other pants! I    we can signal to somebody or   Like who, a blimp captain?! No, like    holy shit, is that Cheryl? What the hell\'s she doin   Suppressing fire Extinguisher!! Is that    Cyril?! Lanaaaaaaaaa! I\'m coming, Cyril! Lana wait! Bet that\'s the first time you ever said that.  Right? Okay, now we can go.  Ya know? Go! Rrrgh! What the    Cyril! Smoke fiiiiight! Woohoohoohooooo! Ugh, no way, that is so unfair! What, are they bangin?! They will be Raves make everybody horny.  And that! Is for ruining! My fake honeymoon! Ungh! Oof! Archer wait, it\'s me! I know! Oof! And this is for the Pueblo! Cyril, hit the deck! Wait, why just Cyri   Get some you sons of bitches.  Get some!   Aw man, I totally missed it   Oh my God, the toilet?! No! Jesus.  Although it is clogged.    Wow, Lana, that was   Right? Totally passive aggressive.  No, that was active aggressive! Because you ruined the mission! Yeah, you jerk.  And why the hell are you here?! Uh, police scanner?! Cyril.  Well, ya know, I mean you two, all alone in the honeymoon suite Oh my God.  Well you can forget about the huge decision I made, that you know nothing about, because I just unmade it.  I    What was that all about?   Ohh, wouldn\'t you like to know   Do you? No.  Malory, you cannot be serious! I know, I\'m sorry, it\'s because I use humor as a coping mechanism.  I meant    And so, while I think it\'s hilarious that your bonuses will now be used to pay this ridiculous hotel bill Which somebody could make go away with a snap of her bony fingers! Ugh! I told you, I have to answer to my board of directors! I don\'t, at all.  Do you even know what that is? I don\'t, at all.  I just can\'t seem to find the humor in what should have been a simple mission turning into a total farce! It wasn\'t    Lana.  It was by definition a farce.  Capped off by the fact that no one thought to stick around and catch the madman selling the uranium! Lana was in command.  Yes, was.  Lucky for the madman.  Whoever he was Aww, maaaan Well there goes my master plan! Yeah, get in there, eat \'em up.  God knows you earned it.Allaaaaaaaahu akbaaaaaaaaaar   Noooo Ugh, no wonder Morocco Mole was so inept, he never got any damn sleep.  Unlike some people! Wuzzat?! Oh.  G\'morning.  Don\'t "g\'morning" me! What\'s your problem? Besides that frickin air raid siren? It\'s the muezzin chanting the adhan, Lana.  God, be open to other cultures.  I am! What I\'m not open to is not sleeping on the floor, listening to your drunk ass fart and snore all night in the only bed, which I\'m sure is why you wanted this room! If I may rebut, point by point? No, you may   A, pretty sure I offered to share the bed, B, I   wasn\'t that drunk   Really.  Lana, this is me we\'re talking about.  And okay yeah, maybe I smoked just a teeny bit too much hashish, but that\'s only because I didn\'t want to be rude.  To who, the creepy old Moroccan dude? Or those Dutch high school girls? Both, the latter of whom were college juniors, and C, Lana we had to take this room, Beat history was made here! Says who, the manager?! Wh ? Why would he lie?! You are American, yes? Uh, yes? Then you know Allen Ginsberg, author of the poem Howl, "I saw the best minds of my generation destroyed by madness, starving hysterical naked" Yes.  So for extra one thousand American, you can have room where he wrote  Yes! Archer, Morocco.  Yeah, hang on.  Is this really the room where Allen Ginsberg wrote Howl? Why not.  Yeah why not? And just so we\'re clear, you\'re mad at all that stuff, and not just being weird because we had sex last night.  Are you    we didn\'t have sex! Good, because I lied, I was drunk.  Want some? Make ya feel better.  What will make me feel better, is to get out of shit  reeking Tangier, which we can only do after we extract   agent what\'s his name, Kazak   who, why the hell hasn\'t he activated his GPS beacon, and while we\'re on the subject, where the hell is our GPS? Oh.  Promise you won\'t get mad? Uh, no?   Noooo   I know, right? It\'s loud as balls.  When did it start going off?! I dunno, like before the muezzin, but after the Dutch co eds left.  You brought them up to the room?! Aha, busted! You did get some sleep! How can you not love this place? The sights, the sounds, the smells No, Archer, just one smell, singular, which would knock a possum over.  Didelphis virginiana! My second favorite animal with a prehensile   Tail.  Thanks, Brett Somers, yes, a tail.  You have one.  I wish, then I\'d be like my first favorite prehensile tailed animal   Archer? Nightcrawler! AKA  Archer.  Kurt Wagner, Lana.  Although he can teleport, so the prehensile tail is   Goddammit we\'re being followed! When were you planning to tell me?! I    whooaaa! Look ooouuut! Oh yeah?! Well    damn, I had something in Arabic for this Wow, that accidentally worked.  Accidentally? Just drive.  There, take that left.  Hang on, I\'m swinging back around.  No you\'re not, why? Because look in here and tell me the Arabic phrase for "your mother is a whore and a goatherd is her pimp".  Oh, right, absolutely.  Oh for    nice, real mature, Lana! Look, obviously Morrocan intelligence isn\'t as stoked about Kazak coming over to ISIS as your mother is so can you please quit dicking around! Who\'s dicking around?! Me, who\'s driving this clown car like Parnelli Frickin Jones, or you, Lana Litterbug! Archer, I am seriously not in the mood for your bullshit right n owww! Oh.  Hold on, I\'m stopping.  Why.  Because according to this we\'re here.  Are you coming? No, but I\'m breathing fast.  Get it? Lana, did you get it? Lana? Or were you just trying not to laugh because you\'re cranky for some reason.  I\'m cranky because I didn\'t sleep  Inaccurate.     and now I can\'t sleep, because I\'m pretty sure I have a concussion! Wait, seriously? Yes, Archer, my head totally kills.  Well that\'s not good  Wait, seriously?    because Tangier\'s totally awesome  Wildly inaccurate.     but it\'s probably not the best place to receive medical treatment.  So what say we grab this Kazak guy and get out of this flyblown shithole.  Okay, but you\'re missing out on all the great things Tangier has to offer.  Name one.  Besides cheap hash and a repulsingly low age of consent.  Rugs?   Okay   Shooting me\'s not gonna change the unbeatableness of their rug prices.  It might change my mood  To remorseful?    but I drew because we don\'t know what\'s waiting for us behind this     Door.  Ya know   Grrowwrrrgrrl! Ungh! Lana! Archer?   Grrrrrrrr   How ya dooin, buddy? I\'ll be better when you shoot him.    I was talking to hiiim, stupid   Great, then I\'ll shoo   Grrowwoofwoofwoofrowwrr!   I don\'t think he likes guuuuns   Okay, that\'s    stop, c\'mon, cut it  Archer get the damn dog off my tits! Here boy! C\'mon buddy! Uh, heel? I don\'t think he speaks English.  Well what\'s "get off" in Arabic?! She asked, regretfully, remembering that just moments earlier she\'d thrown away his eleven dollar phrasebook.  Oh for the    grrrrt off! Oof! Who\'s a good boy? Who\'s a good boy? Who\'s a good boy good boy good boy? Ugh, I thought you hated dogs.  I love dogs, Lana.  Except Mother\'s dog.  Hated that dog.  Because she loved it more than you? Ha ha, very funny.  Although, she never forgot the dog\'s birthday Can we please just do this? Grrowwoofwoofwoofrowwrr! Aagh! What\'re you   Lana put it away! Alright okay okay alright already! See? He really doesn\'t like guns, Lana, he can\'t stress that enough.  Well what are we supposed to do if Kazak doesn\'t wanna come with us? Feed him to Cujo here, he can poop him out when we get home.  Who\'s a poopy boy, who\'s a poopy boy? Shit breath slobberin ass mutt   Don\'t listen to her, she\'s  Wow, but you could use a tic tac.  Kazak? Hello? Kazak.  Kazak! Woowoowoowoowoof! Get away from me, what\'re you doing?! What\'re you doing?! Lana, you can\'t beckon him and then rebuff him! Beckon and rebuff whom.  Kazak.  Woof? Noooo, he\'s not   he cannot be Kazak.  He can according to his nametag.  Son of a bitch! Woowoowoowoowoof! Well, technically she\'s right.  Who\'s a sonuvabitch? Are you a sonuvabitch? Woof! Lana, look! He thinks he\'s people! Nooo, no, no, no no, nooo.  I did not sign on to be a dogsitter for    who\'s frickin dog is this?! Who gives a shit, Lana, he\'s like the Pl of, lemme finish, fetch! Woof! Well I will if you bring it here! I can\'t throw it if it\'s in your mouth! Woowoowoof! Why didn\'t you become a vet? Honestly? Didn\'t have the grades.  No shit.  Why would I lie about that? And who\'re you calling? Who do you think.  Ask her if we can keep him.  Ms.  Archer, Lana for you, line one.  I\'m not here.  Ooohhhh! Then how? Oh for the love, obviously I am here   Whew    I just don\'t wish to speak to her!   But you are here   Aht! If you walk over here and touch me, you\'ll spend your lunch hour being fitted for a prosthetic hand.  I only get forty five minutes.  But I\'ll tell her you\'re not here.  But you are, right? Out! Ahh! I assume Lana\'s mad because Sterling\'s pushing her buttons.  What a surprise.    Speaking of   You finally saved enough money for a sex change.    No.  I\'m actually broker than usual   Nine! Ten! She\'s out!   Uht? Pungash bishiz   But I\'m very comfortable in my own body, thank you very much, and  Don\'t thank me, thank   And before you say  May I finish?! Archer Daniels Midland, now what do you want, I\'m extremely busy.  To be a field agent! I\'m sorry? You should be! How was I supposed to know it was gonna make him do that?! Stuffing him full of street kebabs?! A, it was kufta, and bee  elzebub\'s asshole, Kazak! Bad dog! Bad dog! Sorry buddy, I didn\'t mean that, I  I did! It\'s bad enough your mother sends me on this bullshit mission, but now she won\'t even take my call?! Lana, New York\'s five hours behind, maybe she\'s not in the office yet.  Oh please, she\'s totally there! Wh ? Out! Just checking! God!   Idiot.  As I was saying   I\'m! Sorry! And I\'m sure I      ugh, also speak for Kazak, who, by the way, is the real victim here.  How is he the victim?! Lana, his nose is like a jillion times more sensitive than ours!   Gotta be killing him   Well before I kill him, and you, just get us to the port.  Hopefully the stupid boat to Spain has aspirin.  What boat? What what boat, the boat boat! Wow, you might actually be concussed, because that was not a real sentence.  Archer? And the boat\'s not a boat, Lana, it\'s a frickin hovercraft! Woohoohoohoooo! Woowoowoowooowoowooowooo! Woohoo oh.  But, boat or not boat We won\'t be getting on it.  A roadblock?! So, guess we\'re driving through the desert to the backup extraction point.  Rrowrf.  uhh, uhh.  Sorry.  I know you had your heart set on that hovercraft ride.  But why on earth do you think you\'re qualified to be an ISIS field agent?! Uh, besides Cyril\'s one?   Hey   Cyril? Ya wanna fresh one? I do not, no.  Then shut your fist hole, and show Ms.  Archer how I did on the IFAAB.  The ISIS Field Agent Aptitude Battery? You took it? You aced it?! No, but    this can\'t    you cheated! How?! Everybody watched me take it! Under sterile conditions, by the way! Well   What.  Punkass bitches   Sterile test conditions, anyway.  But I can promise she didn\'t cheat.  Be that as it    hm.  Hmm.  Hmmmm? This means nothing, My God, a perfect score on the IFAAB merely indicates that a person is a candidate for field agent status, it can\'t determine if they\'re suited for actual field work.  I mean, what if she had to subdue an enemy agent? Cue sad trombone, aaaaaaaaaaaand Go! Aaaaaagh! Pam! What the hell did you    waagh!   My God   And it goes on like that, for another thirty eight soul cleaving minutes.  Of which you were there for two.  Three! I was scared, I ran away, sue me.  And then sue me for this! Smoke bomb! So you aced the test and beat up a nazi, a nerd, and queen of the robots  Heeyyy! If the saddle oxford and/or ruby slipper fits! Mister and/or missy! What makes you think I need another field agent? I quit.  Lana believe me, nobody wanted to ride a hovercraft more than me, but   Stop the car! I\'m serious, I\'m  I\'m serious, calm the hell down! Here, hit this hashbrown, that creepy old dude put his lips on it, but  Archer stop the goddamn car! Lana put the gun down, he\'s gonna  Yipe!   Stoppin the caaar, buuuddies   Sorry about that, furface.  Wouldn\'t have shot you for a gazillion bucks.  Rrowr? You, not so much.  Lana c\'mon, we both know you\'re  Quitting, Archer, yes, exactly.  Oh.  I was gonna say "not quitting. " Wildlier inaccurate.  "Wildlier" isn\'t a real word, by the way.  At least not in English.  Rrowr? I dunno, she threw away my phraseboo  Almost kind of wishing she\'d shot you.  Roowr.  No, no, no, I\'m kidding Who\'s my stinky boy, huh? Who\'s my So hey, I know we kid around a lot, but I think you might have dog cancer.  No way, I\'m not going back for her.  You\'re new here, but Lana cries wolf on quitting ISIS like twice a week.  Rowr.  She\'ll be fine.  She\'s got oh.  I was gonna say GPS, gun, sat phone, and canteen full of lifesaving water.  Rowr.  Well?! She\'s the one who stormed off into the desert with no GPS, no gun, no sat  phone and no lifesaving water, and why the hell are you taking her side, she jammed a gun in your   Rrowrf.  So, were you whining about Lana being an idiot or about you being carsick? Rrf.  How much frickin kufta did you eat?! Ruff! Well? Whose fault is that?! Okay, so maybe I egged you on to eat five orders of it, and maybe I push Lana\'s buttons on purpose, and just generally make her life hell Which maybe I do, possibly, if I\'m being completely honest, because I still have some pretty strong  Ah, God damn, dude.  Okay, we\'ll go back for her.  But not because you said so! Because you let him, you let him push your buttons.  That\'s why you stormed off with no GPS, gun, phone, or lifesaving water.  And that\'s why you died in the desert.  Holy shit I\'m gonna die in the desert.  Just like Cheryl\'s gypsy woman said! How.  Would I ever.  Die in a dessert.  Well, pretty close.  And you\'re not gonna die out here, because any minute now aha! Haaa! Archer\'s gonna come crawling back to you, tail between his legs, from   From the wrong direction.  Oh, shit.  Oh, shit.  Wait wait wait, shut up, what? What are you talking about?! I dunno, like maybe a gigantic chocolate mousse, or   I said desert! Oh.  Still pretty close.  Will you put Mother on the damn phone?! What\'s the magic woooord? Oh for the   please! No, they changed it.  Cheryl, you stupid [beeeeeeeeeeeep] Lucky guess.  Plus I\'m a quick learner plus you\'ve seen me drive I\'m an amazing driver plus I almost never get sick plus I already bought three pantsuits plus  Alright! I\'ll think about it! Is that a real you\'ll think about it, or a "Pam if your pig Leon wins a blue ribbon at the county fair maybe we won\'t kill him and eat him for Easter dinner and render what\'s left into soap" you\'ll think about it? It\'s  Because I never really got over that.  It\'s a real one  Yaaaaaay!    but thank you for that glimpse into your bleak, farmy childhood.  It was actually pretty awesome.  And if I\'m being honest, so was Leon.  Get out.  What.  Mother? Mother it\'s Sterling, don\'t talk just Ohhhh no! Guess I had that coming.    You must really think I\'m an idiot   Well, your words Mother, but my voicemail doesn\'t call you.  Oh right.  What\'s going on, did you get Kazak, are you on the boat yet? Okay, in order, I\'ll get to that, yes, no, and it\'s not a boat, it\'s a  Hovercraft, whatever, why aren\'t you people on it?! Well for starters, some of us aren\'t people! But they think they are! Yes they do! Yes they do! Yes they   Sterling! Oh, so anyway, Lana quit, and  She    what\'d you do this time?! Nothing! She quit because you made us fly to Morocco, coach, by the way, and don\'t even get me started on that! For a dog! You know how insulting that is?! A stupid dog?! Wh ? Is this about the carriage ride?! The    I mean, I\'d be lying if I said it wasn\'t a factor! But   Let me tell you something about that so called   "stupid" dog, mister man   Are you    that\'s all we were after?! Well?! You could\'ve told us, Mother! Oh! And you could\'ve told me you just took her to the stupid vet! Whoooo just had a lovely birthday carriage ride through Central Paaark? Woof! Yes she did! Yes she did!   Grrrrrrrr   Whatever, look, we\'re not gonna make it to the backup extraction point, so get a fix on my signal and reroute the chopper to those coordinates! Okay, rerouting now, ETA ten minutes.  Whenever, we\'ll be here One way or the other.  So hey, how you doin on the kufta? Rrf.  Yeah good, get it all out now.  Because this next part\'s gonna suck.  Archerrrr! See?! That\'s why I said scrooch down! Lana! Lana scrooch down! No no no, Archer don\'t Are you out of your mind?! No! Although I am out of ammo.  Okay buddy, so here\'s the deal! A, scrooch down! And B, normally in this situation I do a a pit maneuver, but if I do that the truck will flip, and if Lana doesn\'t die, best case she\'s a quadriplegic and I marry her out of guilt but after a few years of feeding tubes and colostomy bags I start to resent her and the night nurse is like, Brazilian and twenty?   Grrrr   Don\'t judge me! I have needs, man! The point is, and it might be a kinda shitty plan, but I\'m gonna jump on the truck, so I need you to take the   Grrowwrrrgrrl!    wheel, exactly, so Kazak? Aaaggghhhh! Grrowwrrghhh! Lana, look! He thinks he\'s vampires! Grrowwrrgh! Lana look ooouuut! Kazaaaaaaaak! Ungh, Nah, guys probably got nine wives and a jillion kids and. .  holy shit, that\'s racist Archer, what is wrong with you?   Seriously   Lana! Archer, thank  God is he hit, tell me he\'s not hit! He\'s fine.  Woof! As am I, not that you give a shit.    Shhh.  Lana, don\'t ruin the moment   What moment, what\'re you    ahhh.  What\'re you doing, what is that? Microfilm.  It was on his collar the whole time, something about nukes in Pakistan or    one of the akistans, I forget which one.  Owwww! My point is sometimes we do good work.  So promise me you\'ll never quit again.  Only if you promise you\'ll quit being such a colossal asshole.  Mmmm.  I can\'t.    Ya know   Woowoowoowoowoowoowoof! What.No, coordinate with Rome, then get me the lastest intel, then tell Rodney they need travel docuents an hour ago.  Then bring me the file I asked for! ***   What was that?   Nothing.  Good.  Saved you the embarrassment of an incredible homophobic remark.    Ow!   Sorry! What\'s going on?   Where?   Uh, this new place called here? Nothing.  Malory! Good luck! She just had an electro   Electro magnetic lock installed! Are you serious?   Malory!   Because I\'m seriously asking, did Krieger give you robot hands? Not yet! But you just say the word.  The   Out.  Can\'t have anything nice Krieger! Jazz hands! Should\'ve never taken him to see "The Wiz. " The Broadway show or the movie? Jazz hands! Both.  Jazz hands! I    whatever, look, obviously there\'s  Nothing! Is going on, Lana! If there were, I would tell you, but  Uh, there\'s a Cardinal Corelli on line one for you? Something about a radical faction of the Swiss Guard assassinating the pope tomorrow night? You need to get that? Do you.  Need to get that.  No, I\'m sure whoever it is  It\'s the Vatican! Line one! Jesus! Shit, I hope he didn\'t hear that.  Or that, shit! Just put him through, you idiot! Okay,   Jesus!  Shit   Uhhhhh.  Ah ha ha, Giancarlo! Como stai? Molto meglio, cara mia, now that I see your eyes, your lips, your Giancarlo! Siete senza vergogna.  And you, are the only woman who ever made me regret taking the holy orders.  And you are the only man who ever made me  Come oonnn! I\'m right here, ya know! Why?! Gettin new carpet in my office.  Which, speaking of Ron?! Malory, you have married? Ehh You are a fortunate man, signore.  Ah, blow it out yer cassock.  Ron! Malory.  We don\'t have much time.  Your agents of ISIS, they are ready? Or they are confused verging on angry? Lana, it\'s an undercover mission.  At the Vatican? What, they don\'t have black nuns? Although granted I\'ve never seen one.  But that\'s not like, a rule, is it?   Ehh   Well since you\'re not sending me, and I assume you\'re not sending Ray To the Vatican? You think all those Catholic priests wouldn\'t peg him  as American? With that hillbilly accent? Malory, I must go now.  Please hurry! So not Ray, and not me, which leaves In nomine Patris, et Filii, et Spiritus Sancti, et cetera, et   You can\'t.  No one is gonna believe Archer is a priest.  For your infor  I\'m in! Turn it off! Okay! Jesus!  Shit.  For your information, Lana, I have totally prepared for this mission.  Well there\'s a firs  First thing I did was watch every episode of "Lucy, Daughter of the Devil. " Which by the way, was grossly  Inadequate preparation, for an undercover mission protecting the pope from an assassination attempt! I was gonna say "underrated," but   But even if you were prepared  Which I truly feel that I am.     but which you\'re not, who\'s your backup if Ray\'s not going? Cyril?   No   No, it turns out Cyril  Aaagh! How bout a little warning?! Has a thing.  About church stuff.  Since when? Since none of your beeswax, and  Bwoohahaahaaa! Aaagh! Well And I think I need a spanking, because I have been a very naughty baaaaagh! Guess that explains that.  But it doesn\'t explain how Archer\'s gonna run this mission by himself.  Well, if you were "confused verging on angry"   before   Aaagh! What?! Jesus Christ Shit.  God damn it.  Pam! What.  Pam?! What?! Paaaam! Whaaat?! I dunno, what\'re we doing? Esatto! Che cosa stiamo facendo?! Aww man, we have to learn Latin? Ew yeah, that\'s a dealbreaker.  You were speaking Latin when you walked in here   Mmmmno    whereas I was just speaking Italian, which neither of you speak nor even understand, obviously, so   So?! Lana, the assassination plot is being hatched by the Swiss Guard? So? So it\'s an eight hour flight, so we get some tapes and brush up on our  Swiss? Duh? Well, since Swiss isn\'t a language, maybe you should get some tapes on German, French, Italian and Romansh.  Maybe I will.  Alright.  Lana pack a bag, you\'re  No! Mother come on, we don\'t need  Lana! Is going! Ha! And Pam, if you keep your eyes open and your big mouth shut, you just might learn something from her.  Ha! Why are you going ha?! I dunno, what\'re we doing? I\'ll tell you what we should be doing.  So, who does the pope remind you of? Ha! What.  Haaa! Shut up! And you also shut up.  Yessir.  Haaa! Why are you still going ha?! Pink Panther\'s on.  Father Guido Sardoochbag? Oh really? Because she didn\'t specify an agent in command, Lana, so I would argue  With a fence post.  I wouldn\'t argue with a    oof! Move, idiot! I\'m goin as fast as I can! Not you, the  The fence post? Ha! It was a bollard! And my point was  Fine! You\'re agent in  command! Now shut up, brief Corelli, and get the access code to the pope\'s apartment! I will, because I command me to.  And you should eat, this could be a long night, and you\'re so teeny.  Hm? Seriously, eat, you\'re like a slow loris.  Oh, no, bit off my feed, I\'m afraid.  Woodhouse, you need to  Oh c\'mon, you need to fix? Well, is there some amount you can shoot up to get right for the mission, without gettin all trainspotty? Back in a tick! Oh for the    and thanks for making me carry your bag through customs! No, thank you! Grazie.  Grazie mille, vostra majesty o? Your Italian is, how you say, shit? Then you are not gonna like my Romansh.  Mio dio! You think this is funny?! I thought that was.  Assassins plan to kill the Holy Father in his own bed, on this very night, ma tu stai qui con la testa nel culo! Whoa whoa, take it down a notch, St.  Louis! His head is not up his ass! How\'d you know what he said? It was an eight hour flight.  Wow, did you learn Romansh? Who am I, Cypher? The gayest X man? I dunno, Gambit looks like he knows his way around a pair of   Basta! Here is the access card to the Holy Father\'s private apartment.  I assume you have a plan once inside? We call it the old switcheroo.  We absolutely do not call it the old switcheroo.  Mio dio! I know, right? Trope alert! Che? Eh non si traduce bene.  Feeling better? Sound as a pound, my dear.  Where the hell are we? Uh, this new place called Italy? How\'d I get all the way downtown? Wh ? Not Little Italy! Italy, Italy! Bloody hell.  What are we doing here? Thwarting an assassination attempt on the pope.  Using you as a decoy.  Back in a tick! With Ken and your weekend weather.  And you may need an umbrella because it\'s going to be raining.  Dead ass popes.  Aw crap, he\'s already dead.  No he\'s not, he\'s just old.  That\'s how Woodhouse looks when he\'s asleep.  I\'m gonna get a mirror.  Right until he wakes and sees me staring at him with night vision goggles and literally pisses himself.  Hey, does Woodhouse seem unhappy to you, or    what the hell\'re you doing?! Gonna see if his breath fogs it up.  Put the stupid mirror back, he\'s not  Dead.  Nice job, Oliver Cromwell.  I killed the pope! Yeah, that\'s why I said Oliver Crom  Jesus Christ I\'m going to hell I\'m going to hell I\'m going to hell I\'m  Pam.  Yes? Get off the pope.    Heeey, Your Holiness   Is he dead?! I dunno, shut up, I\'m  Should I get another mirror? But like, a much much smaller one? No, you\'re half heroin already! Okay, here\'s Junkie Brewster, let\'s Where\'s the pope? Soo, Here\'s the thing.  Promise you won\'t get mad? I    actually do not promise I won\'t get mad, because here\'s what thing? Um What, why is there a giant mirror on the oh my God you crushed the pope?! Don\'t just stand there idiots, help me get it off and Pam! Woodhouse! Huh? Oh! Oof! Ow! Ow! What the    is that a needle?! Rrrrrgh! Oh thank God! Chi siete voi, dove sono le guardie?! We\'re    Your Holiness, do you speak English? Yes, of course, but  Ha! Way to waste your time learning Italian, Pam! Aw, stai zitto, testa di cazzo.  And could you? Sorry.  Dio mio! He look just like me! Yes, Your Holiness, he\'s a decoy.  We have reason to believe a faction of the Swiss Guard will make an attempt on your life tonight, so  So if you don\'t mind   hopping out of those pope jamas   Archer? We\'ll hide you, put him in your place, wait for them to come in   And then what?! You are only two! Well three, so  Better make that two.  Think I mighta grabbed the tail of the dragon here Ooh, then you\'re in for a treat! Shut up! And with all due respect Your Holiness, it\'s the Swiss Guard I think we can handle a few court jesters with, whatever, halberds.  Which, you realize are just ceremonial.  Obviously they\'re ceremonial, they were made obsolete by the arquebus.  Which is why now they use MP 5\'s.  Oh.  Which is why where\'s the gear bag with all of our automatic weapons?! Well I assume in the hotel room, but  God   I thought they just had halberds! Do you at least have a sidearm?! It was ruining the lines of my cassock.  Dammit! And again, I honestly thought they just had     halberds.  Although technically I think they\'re called voulges.  Santo Padre! La porta, per favore! I got him, just toss him down! I\'m not tossing the frickin pope! Somehow this is all your fault.  Che? Oh for the   this is the pope! Oh, then WOODHOUSE Oof! Ow! Oh for shit\'s sake, already! Archer shut up and find us some  Sparale! Oof! Transport! Are you shitting me?! Well it was this or the Vespas! It\'s not my fault Italy\'s so gay.  Which, by the way, Pope, on the gay thing La Sacra Bibbia says it is a mortal sin.  But get me out of here alive and I will pardon you for it, my son.  Wh ? No, I   Haaaa! So why are you scared of church stuff? Did the unspeakable happen? To your slender, hairless, adolescent body? Wh ? No!   Aww   Eww! Right?! First of all, I\'m not  I\'m not scared of priests or nuns or   Bishops? No, I just    Bishop the android from Aliens? No! I told Ms.  Archer that because I didn\'t wanna go on another mission with the world\'s worst colleague.  Bishop the android from Aliens? Archer! You think he\'s a dick here? On a mission he\'s ten times worse.  That\'s impossible.  ARCHER  Oh really?! Yes, really! A, I was a race car driver! And B  Archer.  Your Holiness, a little help?! The pope could drive better than you! No no, io non guido.  Ugh, esatto?   Oh, capito   Why\'re you taking her side?! She\'s Lutheran! Eh, Luther had some valid complaints.  Archer! Owwwww! Drive the ffffffffrickin car! Okay, Lana! What is your problem? Well there\'s you and also that.  Why aren\'t they on horseback?! Because why would they be?! Right, halberdsmen are foot soldiers.  Mi scusi, the bigger question is, if they really are the Swiss Guards Why are they wearing Swiss Guard uniforms, driving a Swiss Guard car?! Esatto.  Holy sh    it\'s a false flag operation! To make it look like the Swiss Guard! Who told you I was to be assassinated? Cardinal Corelli! He  He wouldn\'t, by any chance, be next in line for the papacy, would he? Well, there would be an election   Right, with the smudge pot    but Corelli would be sure to win.  Pretty good motive.  Yeah, you must make a shitlo  Ahhhhhhhh!!! Go! What\'re you doing?! I\'m letting them catch up! Why?! Can I finish?! He asked, agent incommandingly! Take the wheel and maintain speed! Woodhouse, lighter! I\'m only ninety pounds wet, sir! What? No you idiot, your spoon cooker! Oh right.  Like pulling teeth with you people.  Lana! Head toward Swiss Guard HQ! What, while you request Freebird?! Ha, ha.  Ha, ha, ha.  Ahh.  Actually that was pretty good, for you at least, but no, while I do Shit, I had a pun about flares.  Fake dynamite?! That\'s your plan?! So hey, can I squeeze in a confession? Oho, ora dov\' il tuo Martin Luther?   Fine, I\'ll buy a damn indulgence! Oh wait   Wait until they\'re right beside us, then swerve into em! What, so you\'re crushed between the  Woohoohoohoooooooooo! Shoulda seen that comin Hey, I can see St.  Peter\'s from  Archer look ooouuut! Goddammit, quit telling me what to do! I\'m the goddamn agent in command!   Figo, he really drops the G. D.  bombs   Plus he\'s a whoremonger.  Cough.  Oh please, who hasn\'t paid for it?! Still talking about indulgences.  Lana now! He said, last wordsingly.  Hang on! Ahhhh, oh!! Sparale! Sparale! What the ?! Pam, what\'d he say?! What do you think he said, dicknuts?! Pay attention to the frickin context! Well sorry I don\'t have your language nerd skills! Hang on Pambit! Wrong X Man, dumbass! Still though Non lui! Il papa! Spar\'al papa!   Ohhhh   Ohhh, shit! Pam!! Get doowwwn! Ungh! Ungh! Unghh! Lanaaaa! Rrrgh.  I\'m fine! Yeah me too, asshole! Oh good.  Is the pope hit?! Uhh no, he\'s, they\'re both good.  Recarica! Spara di nuovo! Really wish I hadn\'t focused so heavily on the Romansh ARCHER Lesson one.  Leshau untg.  Context! They\'re reloading! Ohhh That\'s what you mean by context? Spara! What else could she possibly mean?! Who am I, William Safire?! Oh and speaking of in the hole! What? Safire in the hole, Lana, it\'s a  Waaaagh! Lana look oooooouuuu  Ow.  So.  The good news is, my men have apprehended Cardinal Corelli, who immediately confessed to the plot.  Hey heyyy, that is good news! You know how the whole "the good news is" thing works, right? The bad news is  Oh right.     the men you killed were Camorra.  What\'re they, like the mafia? The Camorra is like your mafia like Seal Team Six is like the Girl Scouts.  Exactly.  So equally sexy? Eww! Oww! Oww! But the real good news, ow! Dick! Is that we saved the pope\'s life.  For which we are grateful.  However We cannot tell   these two apart, so   So I actually have an idea about that.  Is it take them both home, see which one\'s a better butler, and give the other one back to the Catholic Church? Never mind.  Then why don\'t we leave them both here until they come to.  I\'m sure Woodhouse never gets a vacation.  Are you kidding? I didn\'t even let him go to his brother\'s funeral.  What?! Oh my    you asshole! Was he crushed?! Probably woulda been.  If I\'d told him about it.  Ugh.  But wait, why did Corelli hire ISIS to prevent the assassination? To show the cardinals he was trying to prevent it, all the while assuming  What, that we\'d totally bl ow my God he assumed we\'d totally blow it?! Well ISIS has a certain reputation.  Hey, whoa! Not cool, Payne Stewart! Oh, my God, if Malory ever hears about this   Which she won\'t! Because Pam?! What? Promise you\'ll never tell Mother! Okay, I promise! Swear to God! What?! Pam! Pam! Haaaaa!?Hurry, hurry, sit down, come in! I have the most fantastic news! What, did Bub finally die? Who\'s Bub? My mother, and before you make some snotty comment, yes I have a mother, do you want to hear my news or not?! Yeah, if you\'re done yelling at me for no reason.  Last night, an Air Force B 52 bomber crashed off the coast of Bermuda!   What? That\'s bad news!   Well it\'s about frickin time! What, we\'re we not bombing them in advance of an amphibious invasion? Why would we invade.  Bermuda.  Ah, Bermuda.  I was thinking Bahamas.  Same question.  Same answer, Why not? It\'s how we got the Virgin Islands.  Actually, the United States bought the Virgin Islands from Denmark.    Okay, Mr.  Peabody   Are you finished? Yes.  Good.  Because the B 52 was   In the middle of the Bermuda Triangle, is this about the Bermuda Triangle, because that\'s my fourth biggest fear! It\'s about the B 52\'s payload! Namely, a Mark 28 hydrogen bomb.  Ohhhh! Which ISIS is going to recover.  What!? And then give to the U. S.  government in exchange for a huge reward! So, ransom it back.  No, not ransom it, Cyril, we\'re  look, semantics, whatever, this is   Treason? A huge opportunity for ISIS!   Or the Russians  The B 52 is on the ocean floor here, at a depth of eight thousand feet or thirteen hundred thirty three fathoms.  How do you know that? How do you not? So recovering the bomb requires a deep submergence vehicle.  The only American DSV is here, in the Pacific.  The Russians have one in the North Atlantic, so if they hear about the wreck and start   steaming toward it    They don\'t actually steam anymore, Mother.  It\'s a figure of speech, like "shut your hatch," because my point was, the Russians will beat them to it.  So we are going to beat the Russians.  Give it up, folks! Mike Eruzione! LANA; Well   shut up   since Krieger doesn\'t have a   submersible hidden in his lab   Or do I? I don\'t, actually.  Then how are we supposed to beat anybody to a hydrogen bomb, under two point two seven leagues of water?! Oh my Jesus God damn alright already! Can I possibly help you? Please, I know you were talking loud so I\'d hear you, so whatever, but we\'re not speaking so if you want a deep submergence whatever you can talk to my stupid gross brother Cecil! Who, by the way, is here to see you.  Ms.  Archer will see you now.  Thank you, Cheryl, I  Rrraaaghh! I hate you! Hello, I\'m Cecil Tunt.  I believe you\'re in need of some assistance? Yeah, RienPoortvliet just called, he wants you to pose for him.  C\'mon, beloved illustrator of "Gnomes"? Jesus, read a coffee table book! Wow, you own an island, an undersea laboratory, and this choppersaurus? Guess it doesn\'t suck to be a billionaire, huh? Probably not, but Cheryl and I split our parents\' estate, so technically I\'m only worth five hundred million.  Which also doesn\'t suck, obviously.  Unlike you who totally sucks obviously! Will you shut up?! I swear to God, if you get us kicked off before I get my jumbo scrimps on   You\'ll wish you were Michael Findlay.  A, Cecil won\'t kick you off, he wants everybody here, for no good reason   He doesn\'t need one, he\'s an American hero.  Who\'s going to make me rich.  And B, that\'s not even real shrimp.  This is all vegan soy bullshit.  Pffrrfft! Prrfft! Puh! Because he\'s totally vegan, because his stupid gross girlfriend Tiffy\'s a vegan, and a brother stealer! Who can also totally heeearyoooou Which is amazing because why aren\'t you dead from protein deficiency?! Uh, because I get all eight essential amino acids from amaranth and quinoa without murdering helpless animals? Oooooh! kkkuughh! Hey, Tiff? Could you, instead of antagonizing her, maybe go ahead and take off? Love yoooou.  We\'ll rendezvous with my research vessel in a few hours, so in the meantime, I guess, continue to make such wildly liberal use of the bar.  Done! You\'re okay, Cecil.  I don\'t get why Cheryl hates you so much.  Right? I mean, you\'ve got this whole Jacques Cousteau    thing going on, that\'s    Just one of many philanthropies.  I have so much on my plate, as it were.  Children Without Plates, speaking of plates, uh, Doctors Within Borders Within borders.  Well, of countries ravaged by war.  Right, otherwise  Otherwise there\'s not really much point.  Then there\'s Nourish A Child, Shoe A Child, Bespectacle A Child,   umm, One Laptop Per Child Soldier   Wait, what? Which, unfortunately, soon became One Thousand Laptops Per Warlord.  Man, all those charities have gotta cost, like   Hey! I should go help Tiffy.  Since we\'re flying into the Bermuda Triangle where mysteries abound! What kind of mysteries? I\'m kidding! Well Cheryl, you come by it honest.    Speaking of   Aagh! Lana c\'mon, we\'re about to fly into the Bermuda Triangle, my nerves are frayed enough as it is.  Really.  No, Long Island Iced Tea number three really took the edge off.  Want one? No, I\'m not drinking, but  Oh my God! I totally saw this coming! You saw what coming? Did you not join the Nation of Islam? No, Archer, I   You know they won\'t let you keep dating Cyril, right? Plus no bacon? You done? Well for now, but after I take a nap  You\'ll wake up just in time to get shot for treason, because your mother wants to ransom a hydrogen bomb back to the United States government.  It\'s a reward! And maritime salvage law is very clear on the subject.  According to Cecil.  And what\'s he getting out of this? I guess whatever useless thing philanthropists normally get from squandering their money on the poor.  So what, he\'s conducting a huge naval operation just for a warm fuzzy? I    hey, wait a second! What? I think I have room for a fuzzy navel.  Wow Tiffy, who taught you how to fly? Was it that goose you freed, ruining last year\'s Christmas dinner, or    Rrrgh, Cecil, I swear to Goddess? I know, Tiffy, but please, try to focus on the greater good.  In the words of the immortal Jeremy Bentham  Good thing I\'m immortal, cause if she says one more word to me I will slam this helicopter into the frickin ocean.  Well, you seem busy.  So say it\'s worth two billion, a fair reward on that would be um, hello! Oh, Mr.  Tunt! Please, join me, you\'re just the person   I want to talk to   And I you.  About my sister.  I was curious if you\'d noticed anything well, curious, about her behavior.  Ha! Ha! Ha! Oh, you\'re serious.  I\'m afraid so, yes.  Well how much time do you have?   As much as you need   Oh my God, I don\'t know what to say I have figuratively lost my tongue.  With Brent it was almost literally.  That\'s why we can\'t have scissors.  I had no idea her mental state had declined to such an extent.  I mean,   the arson\'s not surprising   What have you done? Ha haha! Take that, gazebo! But you\'re telling me she had Mm! Choke sex, that\'s her kink! With a KGB cyborg.  After she led him straight to the ISIS safehouse, at 921 East Seventy Third Street.  Oh my    wait, is that classified?   I won\'t tell if you won\'t tell   Mmmkay! Well, I appreciate your candor in this matter, Ms.  Archer  Oh no, it\'s Ms.  Oh.  Ms. , yes, thank you for, um yes.  Come on, you call this fully stocked? And no Georgia peaches? What the  ? What\'re you doing? I    what\'re you doing?! Hairy navel.  Started as a fuzzy, but I\'m calling this vacation, so Okay.  Love our little talks! Rrowrf.  Nom nom nomnomnom.  Hi, it\'s Pam, right? Enjoying the cruelty free vegan seafood buffet? Mrmff, it\'s pretty good, once you get over how allergic I am to soy.  What?! Oh my God, don\'t eat that! Wh ? Hey! I am a consenting adult.  Plus I assume you\'ve got an epi pen on this big Riptide lookin\' bastard? I    yes, in the first aid kit in the cockpit, but   Well then shut up.  Shutting up, yes.  But before I do, could I ask you a few questions? How is everybody okay with this? How are you not? Lana, you heard Ms.  Archer, it\'s either us or the Russians, and   I did not hear that, actually, but  But if you found somebody\'s wallet, you\'d expect to get a reward, so   What if they won\'t pay a reward? Then what, she just keeps the bomb? C\'mon, it\'s not gonna come to that.  Ooh, but if it does we could move to Cecil\'s island and be a rogue state!   Coool   Ugh, forget it.  Oh, and also dummies? We\'re five hundred miles from the nearest tree.  Hey thanks, Magellan! Hey wait, why the heck are you painting my face like this?! Cause you look fierce.  Rrowr.  Rrowrf.  Well thank you, Pam, I appreciate your candor, and    you really, really should really stop eating those.  Last one.  Mmrowmf.  Malory, please, is there any way I can get you to reconsider this?   Well, if you feel that strongly   I so do.  Cecil says marine salvage goes for ten to twenty percent of the item\'s value, but since all I\'m asking is a measly three percent, if you\'ve got sixty million dollars lying around? Bwexqueeze me?! I know, right? It\'s a steal at twice the price.  Yeah and about that, Cyril figured out how big our bonuses should be.  Your what?! I    Ray made me! Cyril! C\'mon you\'re fierce, rrowr! Rrraarrgh! No! Don\'t! Uh, could I speak to you for a moment? "Wildly liberal use," Cecil, those were your exact words! No, of course, that\'s totally fine, but I wanted to talk to you about   Don\'t say high  functioning alcoholism.  I wasn\'t.  Going to.  Well then what\'s on your mind?   Well, it\'s about my sister   Hey whoa! I dunno what she told you but Carol\'s a consenting adult, so  Well that\'s actually kind of my point, I wanted to ask if you\'d ever seen my sister acting strangely, or  Ha! Oh, you\'re serious.  Just ignore it, it\'s non diegetic.  Last one, stinky pinky swear.  Mrowf.  Psst! Pam! Aw crap, already? Pam! Look, auditory hallucinations aren\'t gonna make you any less delicious.  Hey! I was talking to that! Shhh! Shut up! I need your help! And that\'s how you ask? Cecil\'s like, interviewing everybody! Yeah, he    is he? Doing that? Yes! And I think he\'s taping it! Look, there\'s cameras everywhere! Huh.  I think he\'s taping them saying I\'m crazy so he can show it to a judge and get a conservatorship over me! Huh.  "Huh" what?! I mean ya think that\'s the worst idea anybody ever had? Oh.  My God.  I know, it\'s hard to hear, but  Owww! I thought you were my friend! Yeah and for like six months you also thought you were a werewolf! Aw crap, I can\'t feel my face.  Last one, swear to God.  Swear to God, every full moon she\'d make us lock her in the ISIS vault.  Oh my God, how are you laughing? That\'s not funny, it\'s tragic! I    no yeah, but you know, plus time, it equals   Thank you, I\'ve heard quite enough.  Now if you\'ll please excuse me, I  Cecil? My darling whom I love? And also strangers whom I don\'t even like? Our ETA is fifteen minutes.  And the seas are really choppy, so we may be in for a rough landing.  Thank you love yoooooou.  So you may want to switch to coffee.  Ha! Ha! Ha! Ahhh.  Oh, you\'re still serious.  Or am I? I am, actually.  Have you people lost your minds?!   \'cause apparently it\'s going around   Because   shut up   if we recover the bomb, I will decide if any of you receives a tiny bonus, so   If?! If?! Guys, shut up, I got this, shut up.  What do you mean, if?! Also, what are we talking about? Nothing.  There\'s nothing to talk about, because I am    Jesus Christ! Okay, it\'s either the altitude or a stroke.  Mother, it\'s Sterling! Do you smell toast? Pam?! Grrrgh, grrrgh! What the     hell are you doing?! The cockpit is off limits, missy! Oh yeah?! Well so\'s my inheritance! Goddammit, shut up John Williams! Oh my God you really are crazy! Would a crazy person do this?! Ungh! Yes! What the hell\'s going on?! It\'s Cheryl! She\'s in the cockpit! I think she\'s trying to kill us all! ARCHER Oh good.  For a second there I thought I drank too much.  Cheryl! Cheryl, open the door! Rrrr! Rrrk! Why the hell\'s there a lock on it?! Well obviously to prevent this exact scenario from ever happening, but  Now?! Really?! You think this is a good time to be facetious?! I\'m    fairly certain you\'re not using "facetious" correctlrrmp.  Cheryl? Can you come out here so we can talk about this like adults? Who aren\'t gonna die in a helicopter crash? We\'ll crash with the tapes! Of all of you stupid jerks saying I\'m crazy! The what? The tapes! It\'s part of his sneaky plan to get a conservatorship over me so he can steal my inheritance! That\'s why she hijacked his helicopter? Man, talk about rich people problems.    Grrrgh   What\'re you    Archer, Pam is dying! Cyril shut up! I\'m in charge here! Andokay, here\'s what we\'re doing! Emergency tracheotomy! Grrrk?! With a crazy straw?! It\'s fine, it\'s pretty sterile, that Hairy Navel was mostly Kentucky Moon.  Grrrgh! That\'s not how you make a Hairy Navel! I know, it\'s a new drink, help me think of a name, so far all I\'ve got is Horatio Cornblower.  Which Okay, Pam! Here\'s what\'s happening! I\'m gonna make a small incision in   your trachea with this   Grrrrk?! Archer!   Yeah right, that\'s not sterile   Ugh! And since when do you carry a switchblade?! It\'s a long story, Mother! Neat.  Well, not so much long as just not very interesting.  Okay, Pam, you with me? Then, I\'m gonna stick this in the incision, and you should be good to go.  Ready? Nnghnnnngh! I    no, don\'t   Pam, stop it! Nnghnnnngh! Okay, sorry in advance for this Ungh! Unnngh! Frstrrrdkerrrrrt! Erperperrrrrn! Oh my God, the first aid kit! I think it might have an epi pen! Rrrrhrrrr! Ow, jeez, and hopefully a cold pack Go get the damn first aid kit! I am! But not because you said so! Just breathe Pam, it\'s on the way! So, you think Cecil\'s really trying to steal Cheryl\'s inheritance? Who cares?! Well you should.  Because? Because you\'ve been trying to get your bony manhooks on her money for years, and how the hell\'re you gonna do that if Cecil gets it?! Tapes! We have to find and destroy the tapes there must be some sort of recording device somewhere and why are you still standing there go! What about Pam?! I\'ll buy you a new one! Oww! Grrgh, grrgh! Oh, quit milking it.  Hey hey hey, whoa, Lana stop! What?! If you damage that, it might not work in the event of an emergency.  And what would you call this?! Oh right.  Speaking of, Pam\'s dying of anaphylactic shock.  You got a first aid kit? I    it\'s in the cockpit! Which is locked, and    no nonono! BLAM BLAMBLAMBLAMBLAMBLAMBLAMBLAM! Gagh! And also apparently bulletproof.  Well yeah, you\'d want it to be, to prevent  You shot me! You idiot! Hey! First of all, if I shot you you\'d know it! And secondly, now who\'s the idiot? Wh ? You! All of you! You\'re here because I wanted you here, so I could   Help us get the hydrogen bomb, yeah.  Oh my God! There is no bomb! What?! Well, guess I had that coming Grrgh! Well you don\'t have to rub it in! I just wanted to get you people on tape saying Cheryl was crazy, so I could get control of her inheritance to fund my numerous philanthropies! A ha! Hang on.  Now shut up! And land This shitheap! Ahem.  Now, I believe there was some mention of anaphylactic shock? Thank you! She\'s my patient, Lana! Wait, so if all you wanted was to get us on tape saying she\'s crazy Which I\'m totally not, by the wrrmp.  You could\'ve done that in a lawyer\'s office.  Why drag us all the way out to the middle of the frickin ocean?! Well promise you won\'t get mad? Uh, no? You ssshole! Stupid! Drunk ass! Switchblade tracheotomygivin dicknuts! Ow! Rrrgh! Sorry, thanks, I feel a lot better.  Yeah that\'s why I jammed it in your neck, I figured if    oww! What the hell was that for?! Horatio Cornblower?! I know, right? You got anything? Dicknuts.  Okay, we got the tapes! Big whoop.  I    wait, I thought you wanted  what just happened? It was a hoax! There is no bomb! Boom! Guess you had that comin\' Oh, put another man\'s penis in it.  Attention unwelcome passengers We are now landing, so please find your seats and fasten your seat belts.  Or not, because frankly, I could give a shit if all you people live or die.  The odds on which I\'d put at about whatcha think, Cecil? Fifty to one? Lana? What\'s going on? Somebody shot him.  Will you? Lana, what\'s going on? Why don\'t you ask Cecil? Ow! God, your hands are like   ow! Well as you may know, one of my many philanthropic endeavors is an undersea research laboratory, which, as luck would have it, is actually beneath us right now.  Cut.  To the chase.  Ow! Anyhoo, the lead scientist is threatening    well, he can tell you.  Ahem.  Captain Murphy? Please tell me you guys heard that.  Ahhhh.  Mister Tunt.  Don\'t worry, he can\'t see us.    No, but I can hear you   Although he can hear us.  Yes I can, and please hear me.  For years, decades, I have begged the so called leaders of the world to stop poisoning our oceans.  But they have ignored my pleas.  As I will ignore theirs, Mr.  Tunt.  Unless my list of demands is met in the next Tsk tsk, twelve hours.  At which point, I will launch our missiles on Washington, Miami, and New York.  Hope everybody has a gas mask.  Why do they have missiles?! And what did he mean by "gas mask"?! I, you know, that was, I think, maybe, probably, because the missiles are definitely tipped with VX nerve gas? Oh my God! What? The    it\'s   the    dammit! Still can\'t beat Horatio Cornblower.  Dicknuts! Hrmmmff.Time and tide, they wait for no man.  Nor do I, Mr.  Tunt, nor do I.  And unless my demands are met, I will launch my nerve gas missiles on New York, Washington and Miami in Eleven hours and    oh look at that, eleven minutes.  Hey, make a wish.  Uh, I wish you wouldn\'t launch nerve gas missiles on New York, Washing  And I wish you fools would stop destroying the oceans! Overfishing, industrial runoff, don\'t even get me started on whaling, oh, and plastic bottles?! That\'s    I can\'t even   there is a floating mass of garbage in the Pacific twice the size of the United States! Oh, and where the hell is the news crew I asked for?! With me! And with your permission, I\'m sending them down in the DSV.  Good, yes! I need to get my message to the world! Who\'d you get? Oprah? Bigger.    Ya know   Hello.  Is that her? I    oh right, he can\'t see us.  Which has really got me nettled! Alright, Mr.  Tunt, send them down.  But if this is some sort of ruse Are    was there a follow up, or? No, I was leaving the consequences to your imagination.  But trust me, they are grave.  As in watery grave? I   Sealab out! God damn it! Off! Turn off, you   So, I have a question   How are none of these a minibar?! Oh my God, I know what you mean, right? I mean it is a giant floating biodiesel  powered hotel room Don\'t get snotty with me, missy! You people lure us out here to help the government recover a hydrogen bomb  Which, let\'s be honest, you were going to hold for ransom.  Reward! When the whole time you knew this crazy Murphy character was going to bomb New York with nerve gas?! Well! Not to mention D. C.  and Miami.  Which no one who matters will miss.  What about your South Beach condo? Hello! Florida real estate collapse! It\'s farther underwater than Sealab.  But if my homeowner\'s policy covers nerve gas attacks, that\'s a win win.  Wow.  So my question, ignoring the obvious one of why an ocean research lab has nerve gas missiles in the first place! Is how many men does Murphy have? Mmmmmlike, two? Oh, then   Score.  Two score, so around forty, sorry, should\'ve finished that thmmpf.  Sooo, since we\'re talking about forty hostiles, I have a follow up question.  Something something danger zone?!   Ahhhhh!   I know, I\'m not even trying anymore.  Archer  Noop! Randy! I\'m Cameradude Randy, and this pathetic, trout shouldered excuse for a boom operator is Chet.  Shut up, what\'s pathetic is your plan! Wait, you have an actual plan? Duh, yes Lana.  So, obviously they\'re gonna search us for weapons when we get down there, so wait whaaaaaaaat? Something else danger zone.  Get Murphy alone, get him at gunpoint, and make him disarm the missiles.  Ya know, that might actually work.  Of course it\'ll work, I\'ve thought through every aspect of the mission.  Hence those ridiculous fake mustaches, since Murphy\'s never seen you before and has no idea what you look like? God damn it, Archer! No, that was just an experiment.  I wanted to see if Ray looked gayer without his.    Ya know   But you don\'t.  You just look as gay.  Boop.  Sea Tunt to DSV Goddess.  Wait for my command to disengage the coupler.  Roger Sea Tunt, on your  Noop! Lana move, I\'m skippering.    Archer, no!   Goddammit I\'m skippering! AAHHHHH!!! Huh.  Mildly inauspicious.  Asshole.  What Lana, I clearly called "skipper!" And I clearly said "seatbelts," so You only have yourselves to blame.  Really? Jesus, Ray! Your nose is broken! Really? Cyril, gear bag! First aid kit! Just give him a couple of tampons.  What, that\'s their job.  Really? Just give him some tam  I don\'t have any! Do you think that was wise? Meaning? Well I\'m just assuming, I mean, your breasts are slightly bigger, you\'re  Shut your stupid mustachey dickhole and drive the goddamn submarine! Slightly irritable? Shut up! Jesus, will you drop it?! He tried to have me committed so he could steal my inheritance! I hate him and I\'m never speaking to him again ever! But    okay granted, that was super shitty.  But trust me, you don\'t want to go through life hating your only sibling.    Take my sister Edie   Ha, ha, ha, you have a sister? Edie, yes, shut up, and when we were kids she was so mean to me? Always teasing me, calling me Spamela, rubbing cheese curds in my eyes? One time she stabbed me in the neck? So, now you guys are super close, or? Ha ha ha, hell no, I wouldn\'t piss on her neck stabbin ass if it was on fire.  Ugh, is this the infamous Edie? Yeah, Pam thinks I should forgive Cecil since he\'s the only family I have left.  Who could forgive a person who buys a boat this big with no bar on it?! There was a ton of booze on the helicopter   Exactly, was   Yeah sorry, I had to ditch it.  Well yeah, who needs a first aid kit when you\'ve got ten gallons of booze?! Three and three fifths gallons, Cyril, and I counted \'em so keep your mitts off! Except to pass me one up here, but  Oh great! The world\'s first DSVUI! May I finish?! But since I have zero experience skippering submersibles, I should probably have something light! So Cyril, I\'m thinking coffee liqueur? I mean, not even cooking sherry? I got some Kentucky Moon in my  Ooh, gimme! Dut dut dut dut! You drink it, you replace it.  Grain alcohol\'s a key component of a good bug out bag.  A what? Bug out bag? Oh my God, for teotwaki?! The bear from Star Wars? The end of the world as we know it! Pam\'s like, gay for doomsday, she thinks our whole society\'s gonna collapse if we run out of oil or whatever.  If?! You mean when! Wow, and that is a perfect example of a pre post peak oil mindset.  The    Ahhh.  Say, this stuff is pretty good.  What did you say it was? Basically pure ethanol? Huh.  Well God bless corn subsidies.  Who\'re you, Earl Butz? You say that like it\'s a bad thing.  Oh for the   I said I was sorry! No you didn\'t! Oh.  Well I was planning to.  Oh, well then no hard feelings.  Good, because your shitty sarcasm notwithstanding, I\'m glad that\'s behind us so we can enjoy what is probably a once in a lifetime ad  Rrrowrff! venture, again? Seriously? Why are you puking so much? Ugh, because shut up and steer.  Here, take a pull off this guy.  No! For the like, ninth time, no! Yes, c\'mon, it\'ll take the edge off.  And I think I speak for everybody  No you don\'t.     shut up, when I say we\'d all be a lot happier if you weren\'t so What, anxious?! About a half drunk first time driving a  submarine idiot taking me to the bottom of the ocean to face forty eco terrorists led by a crazy person who\'s about to bomb the entire east coast with nerve gas?! I was gonna say  What?! What were you gonna say?! They\'re going to say that I\'ve gone insane, that I\'ve lost my mind.  And that\'s fine, let them.  Because the real insanity is the systematic, my God the almost deliberate way, those bastards are destroying our oceans.  And I hate that it\'s come to this, but I truly don\'t see an alternative.  So, you all know what you have to do, and I know you won\'t fail me.  Nor I you, gentlemen nor I you.  I was gonna say "bitchy and periody" but then I thought better of it.  Okay, we\'re getting close.  Let\'s go over the legends again.  Lana? I am tough but fair investigative reporter Sojourner King.  Which, ugh, whatever.  Cyril? Chet, sound guy.  That\'s it? C\'mon Chet, the devil\'s in the details! Like, I\'m Randy Magnum, local Emmy winning cameraman and nationally ranked pro kitesurfer.  No you\'re not.  Well Randy Magnum is! Ray, go.    I am segment producer Carl Channing   Oh my God, c\'mon And    what\'s Randy Magnum ranked? Fourth.  And third ranked pro kitesurfer.  What?! No you\'re not! Carl Channing is.  Nobody is a nationally ranked anything! That is the worst legend you could possibly have, it would literally take ten seconds to check it out! Yeah, Carl.  Okay, shut up, there it is.  Jeezy Petes, that thing is huge! Sealab to DSV, over? This is  This is DSV I\'m skippering! Um, okay.  You sound pretty excited.  I am, actually.  It\'s my first time.  Hey, super.  You\'re clear to dock, so just head for the lights.  And I\'ll be waiting for you.  Was that    did he sound    do you think this is some kind of trap? What? No, I don\'t think it\'s a trap! Although I never do And it very often is.    And that\'s how they died   Right? A little peach juice, a little of that old Kentucky Moon, and boom.  You\'ve almost got yourself a Bellini.  Mmmm! Holy shitsnacks! Well it\'s no Harry\'s Bar, but here you don\'t have Hemingway grabbing your tits every time you  Did I misread that? What do you think? No? No, my men are guarding the missiles.  Well there goes that plan.  What plan? To do a one on one interview, just you alone, with the missiles? No, we\'re doing it on the bridge, I\'ve already got it all set up.  But I really think we should do it wherever the missiles are, to underscore the gravity of the   The bridge is where the chair is.  But  The bridge is where the chair is! Yeah, Sojourner.  Thank you, uh? Randy, Randy Magnum, I\'m a local Emmy winning cameraman and nash   Nooo!    shunally ranked pro kitesurfer, second in the nation, actually, which even the most cursory internet search will corroborate.  I really doubt we\'ll have time, Randy.  We only have ten hours before I\'ll be forced to launch my missiles.  Which are where again, exactly? You heard me! I want fifty million dollars! Pff, join the club.  Right? That\'s how much I could\'ve gotten for the hydrogen bomb, so that\'s how much I    what do you mean, join the club? Oh, that\'s just an idiom, it means  I know what it means, you toboggan wearing ass, why did she say it?! Oh.  I assume because I\'m penniless? What?! Ha, ha, oh.  Wait, what? That\'s why I tried to get control of your inheritance.  And I\'m sorry I did that, Beans.  I just wanted to help people, but all these foundations are so expensive.  I know, but Cecil! You really spent your whole inheritance on the poors? Well, and scientific research.  The Sealab alone cost two hundred million.  Wh ?! How did it cost that much?! Well apparently they bought a bunch of nerve gas missiles, and hid that expense in the budget.  Which I never bothered to read.  Or even look at.  Look at this place! Such a colossal boondoggle! We don\'t do any research, really, and building it, I mean, the environmental impact was just insane! So why did you take a job here? To save the ocean! And also my salary is six hundred thousand dollars a year.  What!? I know, but don\'t put that in there.  Let me just read my list of demands.  Ahem.  One, a fifty year, worldwide moratorium on all fishing.  Two  I\'m sorry, did you mean whaling? That\'s number two, if you\'ll let me   Wait, you want to end all fishing? For fifty years?! At least.  The fish have to replenish.  Okay, that\'s it, I\'m calling bullshit.  I want to see the missiles, now.  What, no, you can\'t, you  You don\'t have any missiles! Yes I do! I\'ve got like fifty.  Fifty.  Ten? That\'s still a lot.  Shut up.  Captain Murphy, how long have you been down here all alone? Two years.  Nobody had been paid in months, the foundation was broke Not surprising, given your salary.  Yeah, paid three years in advance.  He is the world\'s worst negotiator.  And you\'re, sorry, but you\'ve obviously had some kind of psychotic break, so I think you should come with us, and   I\'m not going anywhere! Nor are you! Lanaaa! Archerrrr! Murpheeee! I    dammit, I had something about point and shoot, but   A gun?! Are you insane, don\'t you know how much pressure we\'re under?! Honestly, and I don\'t know why this is, but it never really gets to me.  Wait, I think he means water pressure! And air pressure! The tiniest hole in the hull would be catastrophic! The hole! Is gonna be in you! Archer, no! Don\'t shoot.  Okay okay, look, it\'s gone! Now please, put the gun away! No, I will put on the safety! Which should be dammit, I wish Krieger wouldn\'t do these idiot mods.  Duhduhduhduhduhduhduhduh bow dow dow dowwwwwwww! Dow dow dadowwwwwwwww! Wait, yeah, that clearly says "safe," and even Krieger\'s not that crazy Okay, now slowly kick the knife over to  Dammit! Oh my God! Okay, okay, okay, uh, okay, one of two things is going to happen now Oh! Okay! Oohhh! Aahhhh! Okay, now one of one thing is going to hap  OHHHH. .    Uh?

Rrrgh, and I just refilled the cans   C\'mon you guys, get it off of him!   No no, there\'s no time    Plus I think the weight of it\'s the only thing holding in my intestines.  Eww.  Save yourselves.  Let this compartment flood, up to that next hatch Then seal it behind you, and run.  This is pod two, it\'s about a hundred yards to the DSV at pod six, but pods three through six are still watertigh  Pod three, four, five, six.  Flooded.  Aaaghhh! Yeah, that\'s not ideal.  Okay, there\'s  wait, why did a TV crew have a gun?! We\'re not a TV crew, we\'re from ISIS.  ISIS?! Jesus Christ, no wonder this all went tits up.  Hey! Forgive my candor, I just felt my spleen slip out of what was my anus.   That locker over there, open it.  Scuba gear! Dibs on best! Oooh, y\'all I\'m not certified, is that gonna be a problem?   Well, not the biggest problem   There\'s only three.    Sooo   So one of you is going to drown.    Yep, got that   Temporarily.  What? Hundred yards to the DSV.  Best case, for a strong swimmer, two minutes.  The water\'s ice cold, help delay the brain damage.  Use the defibrillator on the DSV to restart the heart.  Yeah but whose heart?! Weakest swimmer.  Wh ? Aww, screw you guys! What, Lana, this isn\'t    entirely about race! Guys, back me up here.  Well I was all county in the hundred meter freestyle in tenth grade   And I have bionic legs   Plus I\'m super scared Plus you\'re a woman? I    yeah, a pregnant woman! What? That\'s why I haven\'t been drinking, that\'s why I\'ve been puking, and that\'s why my boobs are so huge! Well I wouldn\'t say "huge," but   When were you planning to tell me?! When I finally figured out how to tell you it\'s not yours.  Gnk?   Awwwkwaaaard    Ignore me, sorry, I\'m dying.  Crushed, by an off brand drink machine.   Oh my   God, just like that old gypsy woman srgbgh   Gnnk! Gnnk! Gn   Get it together! We both know this isn\'t your first time as a cuckold! Or at least now we both know it.  And for real? You\'re pregnant? Five weeks, long story, yes, but  Shut up.  Here.  Wh ? But  Ray\'s half robot, Cyril, miraculously, is good at something, and Lana, you\'re gonna be a mom! Just promise me you\'ll be a better one than mine.  Because I\'m worried something may have gone   terribly wrong down there   Well if it did, we can\'t do anything about it, and if it didn\'t, all the more reason to drive this tub to Bermuda for some duty free champagne! Archer, that shouldn\'t be that hard.  Ff ff ffrasing Okay, here it comes! You just gotta relax and let it go in your mouth! Ff ff  ffrasinglrrgllrg! Archer?! Laggaah?

I didn\'t give you mouth to mouth! C\'mon, admit it, you Frenched me! You can lie but your boner can\'t! Cut it out, Archer! Yeah, look at ya! All blushy! Archer be careful, the defibrillator    So.  Although Sealab was destroyed   It was insured for three times its value, so now I\'m richer than ever.  And I have forgiven you, for being such an incorrigible douche.  No one cares, because most importantly   I cheated not only death, but also somehow irreparable brain damage! That remains to be seen, and shut up, because Lana is going to be a mother! Three cheers for little Johnny Bastard! Hip, hip!Ahem.  Inappropriate.  The point is    and seriously, shut up    everybody has a happy ending! Really?! Ol\' Ray gets a happy ending?!

Edna Not one word.  Well, except for those three.  And then those five, And Archer! And that one.  I really shouldn\'t say anything.  I mean, unless you can guarantee me Total immunity.  And I mean from everything.  Including anything you find on my computer, Or in my crawlspace.  Oh.  And throw a bone into me.  Excuse me? I said Ms.  Archer had an affair with the head of the KGB for, like, 30 years.  Yeah, until he got blown up, Which was actually my fault.  Because she was busy having choke sex with a murderous cyborg, who then became the new head of the KGB, Until I built a sexier one out of illegal Soviet parts and a corpse.  There was no shortage of dead bodies around ISIS! One of which belonged to the prime minister of goddamn Italy.  Oh, Jesus, I forgot about the Giant pol farm in West Virginia.  And this whole other thing with the Yakuza, Irish mob, Piracy.  White slavery, No, actual piracy, with like, boats.  I want to say Burt Reynolds .  Poaching alligators.  Smuggling Mexicans.

Yeah, jealous of my fallback career, As what, an actual acorn? As America\'s number one country singer! And kudos, but for the rest of us, trapped in the realm of possibility I\'m gonna be bigger than Mac Davis, and Mac Davis can totally suck it! And you can all suck it, because I am gonna play professional lacrosse.  Okay, even if that were a real thing ls it not? you are way too old.  I am not Oh, my God, I am way too old.  Welp, hope I\'m not too old to get back into underground fighting.  Darn, all those jobs are awesome.  And by awesome, you mean delusional, Because it\'s gonna be hard to go back to an accounting firm after this job.  Especially after Mother gives you a shitty reference, Mother, do that.  I meant it\'ll be boring.  Although, I guess I could always go back lo being a defense attorney.  When were you ever a lawyer? Lana, we had long talks about this.  How I wen! to night school to pass the CPA exam because I was so burned out defending scumbags as a public defender? Numerous long talks! With me?

Are you done? Again, seriously asking, Yes.  So I guess we should talk about the elephant in the room, Namely What are we gonna do with literally, not figuratively, a ton of cocaine.  Well Oh, come on! What, Lana, we must be talking Wholesale? Uh Fifty, sixty million? Wholesale.  So what, we form a cartel? Well, how hard could it be? I mean Don\'t! If Mexicans can do it Fifty million dollars, Lana.  We sell this, and we\'re out.  I promise.  Dr.  Krieger has devised a way to transport the cocaine undetected.  You\'re probably gonna want to try to minimize the sweating.  We are gonna go ahead and take the cocaine and the money.  What do you mean "counterfeit"? The Yakuza? Amphetamines! Well, Pam screwed the Yakuza out of a million bucks of amphetamines.  So now they\'re gonna cut her head off, Baby, please don\'! go Get down! Baby, please don\'t go Ron! Yeah, this is actually a little harder than I thought.  Because I don\'t fly.  ARCHER".  So we\'ve only get Did you tell anybody we were hauling a shitload of coke?

Archer! We just started a frickin\' coup! Before I be your dog Get you way down here Make you walk alone Baby, please don\'t go, yeah! Archer! My water just broke! All right now! And, for what it\'s worth, I\'m pretty sure I just invaded Laos.  And, Chi, I swear to God, mention the compass again and just see what happens.  Archer Vice! What? Nothing.  Shut up.  Happy New Year 2015   New Year, New Color ; )Are you shitting me? How can they do that? And do you have to do that right goddamn now? I actually don\'t have to do it ever.  And so I ask again, why are you? How can they seize my penthouse? Well, A, they\'re the government, and B, ISIS owned that penthouse, so Since when? Since this new thing called always? It never struck you as odd that you lived there for 10 years and never paid a dime in rent? I just thought it was because I banged the landlord\'s wife when she dropped off the key.  But I realize now I was mistaken.  Aw! What a scary new feeling for you.  Not as scary as having to live in Casa de Addams Family with you two! Ugh! No, I\'m just working here, not moving in.  I was smart enough to put my apartment in Ron\'s name.  We all could\'ve hidden our assets if you\'d warned us we were about to be arrested for treason! Oh, for the love How long are you going to throw that in my face? Probably at least through the weekend.  Well, then you\'ll have to throw it from Miami.  Wait, no, why? What\'s in Miami.  Besides 90% of all mosquitoes and Cubans on earth? That sounds high.  A buyer for 20 kilos of our cocaine.  Okay, now you sound high.  And what did I say about that horn? Oh.  You were serious? Did I not look serious? Well, maybe she couldn\'t tell, because you seemed pretty serious just now when you said you set up a drug deal.  How else are we supposed to sell it? It\'s not like we can have a yard sale.  Yeah, Lana.  Hello, people would steal it.  I realize we can\'t have a yard sale.  Plus it\'s illegal.  My point is how did you, Malory, possibly set up a major drug deal? Oh, don\'t worry about that.  Kind of feel like I should.  Just worry about not screwing up this deal, because if all goes well, my contact\'s people may buy the rest.  And the sooner we sell this cocaine, the sooner we\'ll all be set for life.  And the sooner we can move out of this enormous Gilded Age mansion.  Which Where the hell is Woodhouse? In the pool.  Hello? I\'ve finished! Jesus Christ, how long does it take him to move in? And so, the sooner you go to Miami Oh.  I\'m sorry, let me eat 40 pounds of coke filled rubbers and we\'re off.  Don\'t be ridiculous.  Hello, pregnant? Dr.  Krieger has devised a way to transport the cocaine undetected.  Oh.  You were serious? God damn it! Sometimes it\'s hard to tell with you! And since Carol insists on keeping Ms.  Gillette here as a voice coach Do, re, mi, fa, so, la, ti No, no, no, no! Again! Do And also since he\'s crippled.  Pam Will be going with you.  Kind of like the third Musketeer, huh? Kind of.  Hey, Pam, relax, breathe, you\'re doing fine.  But since that special "plaster" in your cast can totally be absorbed through the skin, you\'re probably gonna want to try to minimize the sweating.  Yeah, just think cool thoughts.  Like eating mint chocolate chip ice cream in your refrigerated drawer At the morgue.  Happy New Year 2015   New Year, New Color ; ) Do, re, mi, fa No! Again! My God, how I envy the deaf.  I hope you\'re a better lawyer than she is a singer.  Uh, I\'d have to be.  And I will be, I\'m pretty darn excited to be practicing law again.  I mean, hopefully I won\'t have to defend anybody in court But there\'s always a district attorney to blackmail, a witness to coerce, a judge to bribe.  Bribe with what? The government seized the ISIS accounts,  we\'re broke.  Hopefully not for long.  And when that drug money starts pouring in, you\'ll be in charge of laundering.  Hmm.  I\'ll start looking for a Laundromat.  What? Money laundering, you ass! Oh, you mean as a front, because a Laundromat is a cash based business.  Why don\'t I just leave that whole side of the organization to you? Only if you promise to periodically micromanage it and emasculate me.  Cyril, I would have thought that goes without saying.  Ugh! It smells like a skunk ape! Yeah, I\'m hoping the mattresses are just mildewy, and not mildewy and dead hookery.  No, not the room.  These.  Casts smell bad when you take them off.  It\'s a thing people know about! Yeah, after six weeks, not six hours! So, listen, about this deal Hang on.  Pam, chop, chop, torso! Ugh! This smells like a kennel, but for dogs that are poor.  Archer! What? Smell it.  Shut up, look.  Your mother\'s got the time in here, the place, price per kilo.  But there\'s nothing about her contact, no picture, not even a name.  What if this person is really a biker gang? Who gives a shit? Hang on.  Legs! Lana, you and I, more me, were two of the best secret agents in the world We were rogues.  Potato, puh treason, whatever.  But we\'ve been up against terrorists, assassins, the KGB, the IRA, remember, North Korea, cyborgs, uh, help me out.  Uh, space pirates? Oh, my God, I forgot about the space pirates! But the point is we are highly trained covert operatives with an extremely dangerous set of skills.  Pam, legs! And since the government has unjustly accused us of treason, we are now forced to transfer those skills from espionage to criminal activity.  Kind of like The A Team, but we sell drugs.  And you\'re okay with that? Are you not? Lana, it\'s The A Team meets Scarface! That makes me, uh Hannibal Montana?   What the Pam?   Huh? God damn it, tell me you\'re not Pam! Stop eating it, damn it! Pam?   Archer?   He\'s okay! He\'s okay, don\'t come in here, don\'t come in here, he\'s okay! Oh, shit.  What, I said don\'t come in here! Ugh! No, Leon! No, I\'m honestly not judging you.  Really, so this super judgy feeling I\'m feeling is just me feeling like you\'re super judgy and that\'s me? So, um, are you hearing your words? Are you shitting me? I can\'t hear anything over my To beat! You\'re fired back up! Boop! It\'s just we\'re, like, two days into this whole drug cartel thing, and you\'re already addicted to cocaine.  Oh! Oh! Oh! Okay, so I should take life advice from an unwed mother? With a dirty car? ls he dead? No.  He looks dead.  He\'s not.  I think he\'s dead.  Pam!   ls he a zombie?   Pam! Sterling? Sterling, can you hear me? Ramn? You two know each other? Shut your hole, am I dying? No, amigo.  But I\'m so cold.  Oh! Um She insisted.  So we could unfreeze you in the future, once medical science had developed a cure for head smash.  And you Acquiesced.  She\'s all coke strong.  So, yes, I am your mother\'s contact.  After Fidel\'s hit men tried to kill me Ugh, Charles and Rudi, those dicks.  I wonder what ever happened to Anyway, I go into hiding, change my name, buy this business with some little money I borrow from Mama Hey, how is your mother? Jesus! All right, already! Thank you.  So, she telephone me, ask if I know some maybe people, I say yes, I know some maybe people, and here we are.  And, sorry, you\'re getting out of this maybe what? Lana! He\'s helping a dear friend! And also how you say, a finder\'s fee? Five thousand a kilo.  Oh.  Because I want to buy that place.    Oh, man!   Awesome.  Nice, eh? ls the best club in Miami.  Uh, duh! You need investors? Archer, what\'re you Lana, we\'re gonna need an office in Miami, and that office is gonna need to be a red leather banquette! Dios mo, that would be increble! You and me, together at last.  implying that you two haven\'t ever, cough, been together, or It was a mission, Lana! Ramon\'s Latino, so he\'s comfortable expressing affection! It doesn\'t make him gay! Although I am.  So go ahead, Lana, judge away! Right? Pam, shut up.  And Archer, you know better.  I don\'t care about that.  What I do care about are these buyers of yours, Ramn.  Who are they? Just some guys.  We\'ll go see them, they\'re cool, don\'t worry about it.  Kind of feel like I should.  Lana, Ramn vouches for them, I vouch for him, and you\'re embarrassing me.  I am? That\'s flour, by the way.  I know.  Don\'t you think I know that? I know it\'s bad, I\'m not ear crippled! Well, then maybe being a Not a.  The number one country music singer in all of America and some of Canada! Well, what if maybe that goal\'s not realistic? Or even unlaughable? Get out! Wait, seriously? Yes, they were very clear, no guns.  But I gave mi palabra.  Right, sorry.  Archer.  Lana, he gave his palabra! If anything goes wrong, I\'m holding you responsible.  Yeah, that\'ll teach me.  Hmm.  Tough day, huh? The high point was getting shot at.  It\'s so weird.  I mean, she\'s a billionaire, she could be anything, a world traveler, an art collector A transatlantic goddamn balloonist! So, why does she want to be a country singer so badly? Besides being clinically insane.  Yeah.  Here\'s to the crazy ones.  Urn That stinks! It\'s not that bad! I mean, it\'s not great, but This is still some primo shit.  Pam! Quit eating all the goddamn cocaine! Yeah, save some for us, bitches! Charles and Rudi? Wait, the hit men? It\'s okay! Yeah, we\'re like BFF\'s now.  What? Well Or whatever.  Here\'s your fondue set, and was there only one blue fork? What the hell? And how is that tone necessary? Thank you.  It\'s a fork.  And there were two of each color, and you know this as well as me because we stood in my kitchen and counted.  Oh! Well, then I apologize, and I\'ll be happy to throw in another $5.  $80.  For a fork? You can\'t buy only one blue fork! You have to buy the whole set! Oh! That is Okay.  That\'s Okay, okay, you know what? Fine.  We\'ll call it $1 million and $80! Well, there is a small problem there.  We agreed on 50 grand a kilo! And 50 times 20 I think we\'re probably a little closer to 19 and a half.  Okay, a couple Q\'s, I\'d love some A\'s.  One, what the hell is that thing? Uh, we made a body cast out of the coke.  But I tested it, it\'s very pure.  Hmm.  Okay.  Two, how can you eat a pound of cocaine and not be dead? I\'ve actually never felt better! I hope that lasts.  Oh, I\'m sure it will.  Okay, here\'s the dilly and the sweets.  We\'re gonna round that down to 19 kilos even, so I\'ll just take back 50 grand .  Way to go, Pam.  And since the coke\'s in the shape of a Poppin\' Fresh costume and taint sweaty, I\'m taking off another 50.  The hell you are! Can I finish? Can I finish? Since Ramn gave his word that you people wouldn\'t bring any guns Hey, we didn\'t, not even my underwear gun.  I gave mi palabra.  Well, that is just terrific, because, you dum dums, we\'re gonna go ahead and take the cocaine and the money.  God damn it.  And so, right about here is the part where I hold you responsible.  Oh, my God, the burden.  Make sure you take the fondue set Can I finish? And I\'ll take the fondue set because you were a total B hole about the fork.  It\'s not even real Le Creuset.  Right? Of course it\'s real.  Ramn? Just because it\'s from the outlet store doesn\'t mean Ramn! What? Sterling, are you angry with me? Wait, you don\'t think this is my fault? Sterling, please! This is loco! No, Ramn, getting my stolen money back isn\'t loco, it\'s Wait, what\'s the word for rational? God damn it.  What was loco was trusting you! How can you say that? To Ramn, of all people! Look, I don\'t know what kind of history you two have together, but History? What\'re you trying to That\'s crazy, we didn\'t even kiss! Do you even hear how crazy you sound? Do you? I don\'t know, yes, shut up.  Ramn, I\'m sorry, but this whole thing is kind of your fault, so you\'re taking us to wherever Charles and Rudi are having a money fight with our million bucks.  A million and 80.  All right, uno rampageeo! Okay, Lana Votes we cut our losses and go home, while reminding you, seemingly unnecessarily, that she is pregnant.  Oh, my God.  How long are you gonna use that for an excuse? Probably at least through childbirth.  Oh.  You were serious? All right, I\'m going home, but What\'s her problem? Uh Scotch.  And also maybe post traumatic stress disorder from listening to Carol? Yep, yep, Yep! But how is that possible? I\'ve got the whole house wired up.  Bedrooms, bathrooms, bathrooms, other bathrooms, oh, the swimming pool.  Help! I meant, ass Ow! how is she singing so well? Probably because she doesn\'t know anyone\'s watching.  You\'d be amazed what you people do when you think you\'re alone.  Cyril.  What? Damn it, Krieger, you Ow! Turn it up! Oh, my God.  This is exactly howl pictured their house.  Oh, wait until you see inside, Dios mo, they just redid the kitchen.  What, just because you have no taste? Or patience, so if you could hurry up and get our money And cocaine and cocaine, get the Oh, my God.  Lana, Lana, you know what I could totally go for right now? Some cocaine? Right? Did I tell you? Here, give me your gun.  Now push that button, right there.  This is the best kitchen ever! Oh, mercy, thank you You know, if we could go back in time, there\'s a few things we\'d change.  God damn it.  But overall, we\'re pretty happy.  Even though it\'s gonna be a bitch to scrub your brains out of the grout.  Charles, por favor! You have your cocaine, just give them their money! Okay, sure, we\'ve got it right here.  Oh, great, yes, and we\'ve got about a five hour flight home with Pam Cocaine.  So can you throw in a pound of coke? Can I? I totally insist! Oh.  So, you\'re being facetious.  Extremely, yes.  A, the coke is gone.  What? What do you mean, gone? Oh, it\'s not gone, gone, just you know who has it.  What, Ramn? Who is you know who? Uh You still get your cut, \'cause you know who says good job on you know what! What? Ramn! Ramn! Sterling.  Dios mo, I\'m sorry.  Sorry, baby, sorry, baby, sorry, baby, sorry, baby, sorry, baby.  Lana! Get cocaine! Oh, Sterling, I\'m so cold.  What, like hearted? Ramn, what the hell, was this all a scam, or No, no, I swear, it\'s just muy complicado.  I am sorry, I cannot explain right now.  Oh, really? Why, because you\'re Dying, right, sorry.  Take the money.  God knows you\'ve earned it.  All I ask is one small favor.  Before I die Yes, Ramn, I\'ll do anything! You name it, kid, savings bond, a puppy, breastfeed you senseless, just forgive me for what\'s about to happen.  So, um, quick question.  Why the hell were you kissing him? With what appeared to be tongue.  Because it was muy complicado, Lana! And the last wish of a dying man! Who you had a crush on.  No, I Just go smoke some menthols! All right, Sterling, calm down.  My God, it\'s not as if I care.  As long As long as I brought back the money! Is that what you were going to say? Yes.  And I don\'t have time for this, I have a country music star to manage.  Says you! Says your contract, missy! Read it! You read it! God damn it.  And, I\'m sorry, but the money is where, exactly? Um In your masturbators, you idiot.  Oh, I\'m the idiot? I mean, historically.  Well, I\'m not the one who sold 20 kilos of coke for Monopoly money! What? It\'s counterfeit! Every last bill! No! No way.  Son of a Sterling, you fool, was this all just a huge set up? For what, Mother, a funeral? They\'re all dead! Yeah, but are they? We got out of there in a hurry.  Ramn! Will you come on? But the gunshots, all the blood.  Blood packs and blanks.  Even Ramn? Especially Ramn.  I bet the whole thing was his idea.  Aha! You\'re forgetting a key piece of the puzzle, Lana! They\'d already stolen our coke, and they had the money! Why go to the trouble of a fake shootout? See what I\'m saying? But this way, we have 20 kilos of pure, uncut, Colombian cocaine.  Holy shit, yes! Which we had already stolen, so we still would\'ve had it! Plus the counterfeit million dollars, which now we don\'t have! Like, 50 times I tried to explain this! Hmm.  Yes, I see now what you are saying.  Ta da! Jesus, it\'s like trying to explain particle physics to a particle.  Aha! But this way, my way, Archer thinks we are dead.  So he will never think to come looking for us again! It was still a stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid plan.  Happy New Year 2015   New Year, New Color ; )Ruined.  Completely Mother, come on, we\'re not Shut up.  And utterly We\'re not Shut up.  And ruined! We\'re not "ruined," Camille.  We\'ve got 2,000 pounds of cocaine.  Minus the 20 kilos you sold for Monopoly money, oh, minus however much Pam ate, probably two kilos.  Or three, or whatever.  Quit eating all the goddamn cocaine! Make me! My point, unless Pam ate it, is that things could be a lot worse.  How? You sold a million dollars of product for this worthless stack of paper.  How could it be any worse? I hate to agree with Archer, but it could be worse, these are actually really good fakes.  I mean, not good enough to deposit in a bank, but Good enough to pass in, say, a deli? Yeah, I guess, but Shut up.  So you take a hundred, go buy a pack of gum, and walk out with $99. 50 in change.  Hey, that\'s brilliant, Archer.  Yeah, plus gum? So you\'re gonna do that 10,000 times? Well, not me personally.  Not anyone personally, it\'s idiotic.  What we need is a big ticket item.  Like a big bag of cocaine! The last thing we need is more cocaine.  Disagree.  Because you are addicted to cocaine! Your words.  Hey, wait a second.  I\'ve got the perfect big ticket item.  Cadillacs!   Nope.    Let me finish.  Oh, I\'m sorry, please, skip ahead to the part where I\'m out 50 Caddies with your counterfeit money in the one hand and my schlong in the other.  Well, not now.  You ruined it.  The mental image alone.  And besides, what were you planning to do with 50 Cadillacs? Um Open a dealership? What? Ron\'s done very well.  Speaking of, why aren\'t you at work? Everything\'s on autopilot.  There\'s nothing for me to do.  I am so bored.  Have you tried cocaine? No, no, no.  Smoked a reefer cigarette once.  Oh, let me guess, with some Negroes? As luck would have it.  What about guns? No, no, they seemed nice, jazz cats.  No, why don\'t we buy guns? I mean, I assume rival drug dealers aren\'t gonna be too happy with us And since the FBI seized all the ISIS weapons when they took the building.  Oh, my God.  All we have now is my Walther and what, Lana, your TEC 9\'s? Yeah, for which I have no ammo.  What? I used to get it from work.  Okay, if we\'re doing a list? Bullets.  Oh, for Sterling, Lana, go through the old ISIS files and find an arms dealer.  Cyril, go lock up the product before Cokie Monster here gobbles it all up, and Ron, take me to lunch.  It\'s 8:30 in the morning.  A bar, then! Whatever! Ooh! Or maybe a jazz club.  We can smoke reefers with these Negroes you\'re suddenly so nuts about.  It was 1940! And where am I supposed to lock up 2,000 pounds of cocaine? Cyril, look around.  Somewhere in this mansion, I have to assume, is a gigantic, Scrooge McDuckian vault.  Scrooge McDuck, eh? Sweater.  Happy New Year 2015   New Year, New Color ; ) All right.  Where are we? Lana, did you find an arms dealer? Hmm.  No, all we\'ve got so far is Spirodon Skorpio and Conway Stern.  Jeez, those are old files.  One of whom we blew up, the other of whom\'s hand we gruesomely ripped off.  And both of whom bring up extremely uncomfortable sexual memories for, the people in this room.  Oh! What about Ray\'s brother, the pot farmer? He had lots of guns.  Yeah, he\'s doing life in prison.  Now, that\'s the song you should write.  Ugh! Or maybe one about a crippled cyborg, who all he did was pussy ache about being a crippled cyborg! Well, keep looking.  And, Cyril, you\'ve got the product under lock and key? Yeah, in the kitchen pantry.  There\'s no Scrooge McDuck y vault.  No what? Uh, how about an old timey gymnasium full of Indian clubs and medicine balls? Hello? I\'ve finished! There is one of those.  Oh, and it was a good idea to lock up all the counterfeit money.  Yeah, good job, whoever did that.  Wait, did you not? No, I What? Well, where the hell is it? Well I\'ve got good news and good news.  Amphetamines? Right? And I know it sounds crazy, but I like them as much as cocaine.  Where did you get them? Okay, okay, okay.  So remember how I used to drift race with the Yakuza? The Yakuza? What, were the Hells Angels busy? Busy being pussies.  You know, relatively.  When compared to the deadly and terrible Yakuza.  Yeah, and on a related note, Pam, what do you think\'s gonna happen when they realize the money is counterfeit? Oh, my God, right? Can you imagine? Yes, Pam, we can.  Oh, my God, they chop off their own fingers.  Do they know how to find you? Uh Well, they know I work at ISIS, but that won\'t do them any good.  Well, thank Although Domo arigato, fellas.  Two of them have been to my apartment.  You, too, Ojiisan.  Or three, or whatever.  Oh, Jesus Christ.  Can the mind vomit? But now I live here, so Well, thank God, the Although Hmm? Hmm.  Hmm hmm.  Hmm.  Mmm hmm.  Ugh, yes, the mind can, in fact, vomit.  I\'m not here.  Oh, dear God.  Telephone clanging away, and me trapped.  It\'s a good servant\'s worst nightmare.  I don\'t know how this could possibly be any Hey, so, did somebody order Chinese? They\'re Japanese, you idiot! Oh, for I don\'t get all pissy every time you mistake a Dutchman for a Swede! Either time that happened! Answer the goddamn telephone! Now, there\'s your song! No! Answer it! Make me! I will break both of your collarbones, and then pull them out of your body Holy shitsnacks.  and then use them to play, in its entirety and on your head, Moby Dick.    Bonham\'s a pussy.    Maybe you pussy! Pam? Hello? It\'s Mr.  Moto! I am very ashamed.  Your new home is so beautiful, but I did not bring a housewarming gift.  Hey, you know what? Don\'t even sweat it, because Hmm? Okay, bye.  Wait, didn\'t you shoot that guy? Oh, who remembers? Well, what did he say? Well, he\'s not happy, obviously, and he wants his drugs back, and that guy who sold them to me is not gonna be playing the violin any time soon.  Because? Because a violin would probably dissolve in the same big drum of acid   they dissolved that guy in.    Ew! But if all Moto wants is his drugs Then he can give us a refund.  Of worthless counterfeit money? It\'s not exactly worthless.  The right buyer would probably pay about 15 cents on the dollar for it.  What? Why didn\'t you say that? Uh, I don\'t know.  I assumed you knew.  Everybody knows that.  Ron? I say screw the money.  Let\'s just give Moto his drugs and be glad we dodged this giant metaphorical bullet.  Hey, and where are we on that list? Malory? Oh, all right! We obviously can\'t go to war with the Yakuza.  Uh, not without normal size, non metaphorical bullets.  But, Pam, if there ever are any, this comes out of your share of the profits.  How is that not fair? Moto doesn\'t just want the pills! He also wants my head! Non metaph phorically speaking, Pam, we got it.  Wait, he\'s still gonna kill you? Even if you give back the pills? Yes! Oh.  Hey, hey.  Shh.  Come on.  We\'re not gonna let the Yakuza kill you.  Although Christ on drums, people! What? Pam screwed the Yakuza out of a million bucks of amphetamines, so now they\'re gonna cut her head off.  Wait, since breakfast? You had breakfast here? Ron! And apparently, they\'ve got your house completely surrounded, so So call the police.  Ooh! Good idea, and when they get here, we can show them the drugs we bought with the counterfeit money we got from selling cocaine.  Oh, and by the way, Officer, there\'s another 2,000 pounds of it in the pantry! So, then pay them! With what? $1 million! Yes, real dollars.  Duh.  Look at my house.  I bet I got rugs worth a Fine, $2 million.  Okay, $5 million.  Fine, $10 million! $50 million! A jillion million! Jesus! Be more gross and Chinese y! Been waiting forever to use that.  Why did you insult him? A, "Chinese y" is not an insult.  No.  No, it totally is.  Not to a Chinaman.  And B, which is, like, so un Chinese y, he doesn\'t even care about money.  He said it\'s a debt of honor, and it can only be paid with Pam\'s blood.  And since I can\'t write a genre defining country song with you people screaming about a horde of Chinese daylight vampires, who are probably scuttling up the drain pipes even as we speak, go out there and kill them! Don\'t even get me started on that.  How about get started on that list? I\'m not your secretary, Lana! We don\'t really have weapons or ammo.  You\'re shitting me.  No.  Whoa! I stand extremely corrected.  Yeah, and they\'re all loaded.  This was the best house to be a kid in.  Mmm, yeah, and so Anything post World War I? I don\'t know.  I think Grandpapa lost interest once he filled the Museum of Natural History with dead animals.  Then he got real big into model trains, and then it was a sort of very long, sad slide into dementia, and ultimately, into death.  And the whole time he was screwing the asses off all the colored maids.  No, that\'s a terrible country song.  Here\'s your country song right here! Have you ever heard a country song? Um, Danger Zone? Okay, listen up, there are way too many windows and doors to cover, so we need to concentrate on chokepoints.  Not that kind of chokepoints.  Chokepoints as in junctions, like the main foyer, the kitchen, the top of the grand staircase, the What are you doing? Here.  Nope.  What do you mean, "nope"? Take it! Woman, I am not getting in a shootout with the goddamn Yakuza because you people decided to steal their drugs! Well, I support you in your work! Not that you ever do any, but If you were honest with yourself, you would realize I have been incredibly supportive of you! Get arrested for treason, I stand by you, become a drug dealer, I stand by you.  And you don\'t seem to mind driving around in a new Cadillac, do you? A floor model.  Oh, for Sterling? What in the hell does he think he is doing? Going Josh Randall on these dicks! Cheryl, build a fire and get some pokers hot! Yeah, great, start shooting.  I can\'t wait to meet every cop in Manhattan.  Right, damn.  Hey, Carol, you got any old timey silencers? Silence, yes, aspire to that while I think of a plan.  Okay, Cheryl God damn it, Archer! I didn\'t do it! I was just What Ron? Ron! Talk about a floor model.  Oh, come on, we were all thinking it.  Get down! Tadashi, what is wrong with you? You shoot like an old blind woman! You bring shame on your family! Oh, my God, the darkness, babe, I\'m slipping into the darkness! They\'re just pulling the drapes! Still, though Ah! And what is this? An ocelot pelt? Wait, what? It was all I could find! Oh, my God, if that\'s Babou Ugh, I wish.  He\'s around here somewhere, either puking or pissing on something I care about.  Hey, so, Ron\'s gonna die? Wait, Ron\'s gonna die? Oh, the darkness! Especially if he goes into shock, which is why I\'m speaking quietly.  Smart.  We have to get him to a hospital, so are you sure there\'s no other way out of here besides the front door? Like, maybe a helicopter pad, or The only thing I can think of is all the secret tunnels.  I\'m sorry? Yeah, they go everywhere.  My I want to say my great great great uncle? He built them trying to tap into the Underground Railroad.  Wait, did he think it was literally A subterranean railroad, yeah, so So why\'d he build a bunch of tunnels? To capture runaway slaves and sell them back to their rightful owners.  Wow.  Ugh! Whatever! Can we I want to say his plan was to dress like a ghost? Can we get Ron to a hospital? Oh, totally.  And then this one here goes all the way up to Lenox Hill Hospital.  Jesus, that\'s like a mile! Yeah, you don\'t want to walk that.  So I\'d come up around here and get a cab.  That\'ll be way quicker.  Plus, I bet there\'s mole people.  I think her point was, with all this, your great whatever uncle must have really wanted to catch some slaves.  Oh, it bankrupted him, and the crazy part, is this was, like, 1890.  Will you hurry up? We\'re losing him.  Ron, shut up! Okay, Carol, you know the tunnels, you lead the group.  Cyril and Pam, you carry Ron.  Lana Why do I have to carry him? Because remember before when this whole goddamn thing was your fault? Just asking.  Lana and Mother, you should go with them, because my plan may not work.  What plan? Okay, this tunnel here tees into a utility tunnel right in front of the house.  So Sol need my slightly darker, black, black suit.  Woodhouse! God damn it, where the hell is he? Slowly dying, for all anyone cares.  But the saddest part is no one does.  Oh, who cares? Quit your literal bellyaching.  Ow, ow, ow, ow! Yeah, I\'m staying.  Because if your plan is what I think it is, you are totally gonna need rescuing.  No, I\'m not, Lana, so shut your dicktrap.  But if I do, I apologize for that remark, and ask that you definitely do rescue me.  Or avenge me as appropriate.  That\'s it, I\'m staying, too.  What? You\'re picking him over me? Oh, for it\'s not a competition, Ron! He\'s my child.  But seriously? A floor model? Ah What are you people, hourly? Let\'s go here.  Are you laughing at "dicktrap"? But seriously, though, if it comes down to it, please do rescue me.  Okay! Sorry! I\'m walking backwards here.  God, you\'re killing me here is what you\'re doing.  Just try to stay calm.  Yeah, chill out.  Ray got shot in the stomach and he\'s, like, totally fine.  Here we go, stepping it up! Hey! Jesus, Ron, man up.  I\'ve been shot Holy shit, 26 times? Can\'t be good for me.  I mean, in gangster movies, they\'re always like, "He got a bad case of lead poisoning, see!" But think about it, every bullet\'s got to leave at least a teeny bit of residual lead in your body, right? Shit.  By the time I\'m 60, I bet I\'ll be mad as a goddamn hatter.  I don\'t believe it.  He made it.  You never give him enough credit.  And honestly, not your best trait.  You may want to work on that, since you\'ll be a mother soon.  Unless, well, I suppose that all depends on what kind of mother you want to be.  Uh The door, san? Thanks, Kato! Yoshi! Yoshi! I\'m sorry, Yoshi is indisposed.  You! Me.  Scrooch! You must know Hang on.  Oh, God.  Sorry, I don\'t want to get a dry socket.  You must know that even if you kill me, the Yakuza will never forgive this debt of honor.  They will kill Right? That\'s so bad for your ears.  But I get it, the Bushido code, the whole Japanese thing, I get it, but What do you know about being Japanese? I guess only the cliches, really.  Karaoke, pachinko, subway frottage Enough! Hang on.  Uh Tentacle porn, uh Enough! Hang on; Those vending machines that sell used schoolgirl panties.  Okay, done.  Now, here\'s what I propose.  You dare to propose I swear to God I can do that all day.  I mean, to me, it sounds like bubble wrap.  What is your proposal? I know the Yakuza will hunt us down forever, but I bet you can forgive the debt of honor, right? Only if blood has been shed.  Well, my step My mother\'s husband is about a quart low You shot him.  So I\'m thinking you take back all Well, almost all the pills, Pam ate a bunch, and I\'m not gonna lie to you, I had a couple, or six, plus you keep the counterfeit million.  Plus if you don\'t, I\'ll kill you.  Probably should have led with that.  I must accept.  But I cannot lose mentsu.  What you call "face. " My men must think this was my decision.  That you somehow "sweetened the deal. " Well, at this point, the reds are wearing off and the bourbon\'s kicking in, so, you can pretty much name it.  Hmm.  That is so true.  That was Cyril.  Ron\'s in surgery, but the bullet missed everything, and his prognosis is excellent.  Oh, my God, that\'s great, so So win win! What Win win? Ow! Malory.  A gut shot husband and an idiot son who just gave away $5 million worth of cocaine? I call that a lose lose lose! What could possibly be funny? The phone! It was Wood house\'s! Happy New Year 2015   New Year, New Color ; )And so, if I could direct your attention to these visual aids, you will see that from our initial supply of 1,000 kilos of cocaine, we Hang on, dummy, we had a ton of cocaine.  No.  Well, we had a tonne, T O N N E, also known as a metric ton, but Metric.  Who uses metric? Every single country on the planet except for us, Liberia and Burma.  Wow, really? Yup.  \'Cause you never think of those other two as having their shit together.  Anyway, as you can see Why are they thermometers? I thought they were cocks.  Wait, they\'re not? No.  They are not cocks! Okay! Jesus, you people.  Next time, remind me to get shot in the head.  Uh, Ron, next time, get shot in the head.  Sterling, shut up.  Cyril, continue.  So, as you can see, we are already down to 125 kilos of cocaine, which was worth about $6 million, so Wait, how much is that in pounds? Forget pounds! We\'re doing kilos! No, I meant pounds.  Sterling! Exactly.  As in Doctor Who money.  How do you stand there and crack wise when this is all your fault? My fault? I only lost 44. 092 pounds of it, Mother.  It\'s Pam\'s fault we had to give the Yakuza 100 kilos.  And this other five, spoiler alert, she ate! Yeah, and would now be a good time to talk about Pam\'s cocaine addiction? Or the inspiring story of her heroic struggle to finally triumph over it? What are you eating? Yogurt! Give me that! Hey! Lick it.  Ugh! Well, can\'t unhear that.  Holy shit, yogurt is amazing! Why have I never tried yogurt? How have you never tried yogurt? Mmm.  I didn\'t know it was that good.  It\'s good because it\'s cocaine! Oh, my God.  And little kids eat it? Cyril, you said it was locked up.  It is.  In the cage in the pantry.  Then how did she get it? That is it! You\'re going to rehab.  What? No, I can\'t! And you can\'t make me! Yeah, is that even necessary? I think she\'s in a pretty good place.  She\'s going and that\'s final, and I swear to God, if you send me to freaking rehab, I\'ll go right to the cops! What? Come on.  You wouldn\'t dare.  Oh, yeah? Just try Goddamn, Woodhouse.  Only thing for a grass, mum.  And, sir, I\'m afraid your breakfast will be four minutes late.  Ugh.  Typical.  Happy New Year 2015   New Year, New Color ; ) What are you doing? Come on.  Tighter.  That\'s tight enough.  We\'re not making tit bondage porn.  That\'s a thing? Oh, yeah.  Ugh! Ditto.  I just don\'t want her to escape.  You know how strong she is.  Might as well be green and half deaf.  What if we move the coke and lock her in the cage till she\'s clean? Hey, yeah, sweat it out, like Popeye Doyle.  How long would that take? I don\'t know.  Couple of weeks? Try couple of never.  This is Pam we\'re talking about, the poster child for addictive personality.  What is wrong with you? I learned it by watching you.  Oh, my God.  Yeah, spoiler alert.  So, what do you suggest we do? We throw her a party.  With an enormous cake! Cyril, can we spare another five pounds of cocaine? Malory! Who are you, Thomas Corwin Mendenhall? Right? We\'re not killing Pam! Wait, what? Jesus.  Oh, come on in.  Make some more noise.  Just \'cause now you\'re the fat one? Um, I said we were not killing her.  Oh.  And, also, this is a baby.  Ew! A baby, by the way, that I did not eat, but to which I will give birth.  Ew! Right? Well, if she won\'t go to rehab and you won\'t let her die with dignity From an overdose of cocaine cake? Oh, please.  Change the word "cocaine" to "Cookie Puss" and that\'s how her obituary was going to read anyway.  I may have a simply elegant solution.  Krieger.  Right? This place is like a Habitrail, there are secret passages everywhere.  I think that\'s why the colored maids never felt safe.  They\'d be polishing a spittoon or whatever and suddenly, Grandpa.  Yeah.  And dressed up like a ghost? What is it with your family wearing ghost costumes to scare black people? What is it with you people making tit bondage pornos in my ancestral home? Ooh, yeah.  So what\'s all this about a solution? Aha! Yes.  And what is on my finger, you ask? I promise you no one is asking that.  Well, they should because this nearly microscopic, wittle bitty guy is my new and improved mind control chip.  Improved? On the one that made Len Trexler think he was a giant lettuce? Len Trexler Who the hell is Len Trexler? Never heard of him.  It\'s way improved, and look how tiny.  I don\'t even need a drill.  I can inject it right through the temple.  Wait, what are we doing? Stabbing science into your brain.  What? It\'s for your own good, dear.  Yeah, so you don\'t wind up giving blowjobs in a bus station toilet.  But for cocaine.  No! Let me go! Krieger, do you think a chip could cure someone of stage fright? No way! Nope! But you could be famous.  I could be lettuce! Now, you listen to me, missy.  You are getting a brain chip, and then you\'re going on the Grand Old Opera, and I don\'t care if it kills you Pam, honey, just calm down! Somebody do something! Nobody do anything! Lana.  Lana! Krieger!   Yeah, I\'m on it.    Ow! Idiot.  Pam! Lana! This is only somewhat like that old Gypsy woman said! Lana.  What? God shit damn it, Archer, what? Uh, never mind.  Archer, I The last thing you need right now is a big, shit eating "I told you so. " But it\'s exactly what you deserve.  And, Krieger, I hope you have a lot more where this came from because Super.  Hunting women to force them to have surgery against their will.  It\'s for Pam\'s own good.  She\'ll die if she doesn\'t quit eating cocaine.  And who\'s going to die if you don\'t get rich managing Cheryl\'s singing career? Maybe you.  Now, get out there and have some fun! How could we not? Woodhouse, I swear to God, if you tell me lunch is four minutes late No, sir.  There\'s a Mr.  Holly here.  Sorry, an Agent Holly.  From the FBI.  But lunch is still a firm 12:00.  Firm 12.  You know, as in inches? Jesus, 0. 3048 meters.  Hi.  Welcome to Nazi Canada! Why is the FBI here? Did he show you a warrant? No, sir, he Then tell him to go piss off, he can\'t come inside without a warrant.  He Well, unless you invite him in.  He\'s not a vampire, idiot.  Plus, it\'s daytime.  If invited in, law enforcement can enter your home without a warrant.  Once inside, under the doctrine of "plain view," anything illegal, say, a truckload of cocaine in the kitchen, can be lawfully seized as evidence.  They can also enter a private residence under any number of exigent circumstances, like providing emergency assistance to an occupant, say, if they heard someone screaming Good morning.  No, sir, good day.  I insist that you leave immediately, as you have entered this residence unlawfully.  You want to jump in here, Yoda\'s dad? I invited him in.  Woodhouse! And once you do that, you know, we are in.  Not unlike vampires.  See? What? Be that as it may, why are you here? Oh, just checking in, making sure you folks aren\'t engaging in treason, espionage or anything else illegal.  Well, I can assure you Like drugs.  Hmm? Cocaine? Nope.  Yakuza? Shootout? Mmm mmm.  Nope.  No one here was shot by the Yakuza? Well, I think we\'d remember that.  Then what\'s his problem? Vasectomy.  Piles.  Gout.  Mumps.  Gout mumps? Progeria! He\'s just a little boy.  But whatever is wrong with him Gout mumps.  is none of your business, and since nothing in plain view would lead a reasonable person to suspect illegal activity, I demand that you Nobody move! Well? They can also do what\'s known as a Protective sweep! Case law regarding search and seizure is actually quite interesting What about the cocaine? admissible as evidence, but only if he sees it.  So we have to keep him out of the kitchen.  All right, fan out! Agent Holly is the prime target, but So, just so we\'re clear, you want us to tranquilize a federal agent? Do you have a better idea? I do not.  Then we just slap some panties and rouge on him, pose him with Gillette, whose fault this is, make some glossy 8 by 10s.  I\'ll do it! I have a camera! Dibs! And then I doubt we\'ll be hearing from Agent Holly in the future.  Or you could pose him with Woodhouse.  What? God knows, he\'s a little GILF.  Ew! That\'s a thing? How do you not know the different kinds of porn? Because I have sex with actual women, Cyril! My girlfriend\'s not equal parts the Internet, a tube of Kentucky jelly, self loathing and a sock! Tell that to your cellmate! Now, go! You scared the shit out of me! Ugh! What, literally? Seriously, dude, what is up with you? I could walk, and now I can\'t, and ain\'t nobody loves old Ray no more.  Well, yeah, you\'re disgusting.  But, you, I am totally digging this whole Queen Kong vibe.  My God, are they torturing a woman? Hang on, ma\'am! I\'m a federal agent, and I\'m coming! By God, I am coming! Okay, you three head upstairs Hang on.  I\'m going to the kitchen to make sure he doesn\'t stumble onto the coke.  Hang on.  What? Question.  What? Are we not saying "phrasing" anymore? Which, that\'s fine, whatever, but if we\'re doing a new thing and nobody told me, that I\'d have a problem with.  Oh, screw me! Said Ripley to the android Bishop.  Wait, hang on.  Um God damn it! What was wrong with "phrasing"? Nothing! I\'m fine.  Just get out, leave me alone! I just need to be sure you\'re not being held here against your That is a federal offense! I said, get out! Oh, hey, remind me to reboot the CPU in Ray\'s spine so he can walk again.  What? A reboot? That\'s all it takes? Beep boop.  He\'s been paralyzed for months.  What the hell have you been waiting for? Think how much happier he\'ll be now.  Or, and I\'m just spitballing here, I find Holly first, show him the coke, get immunity, testify against them, then you and I go into witness protection and spend the rest of our miserable lives on the run, hounded by the fact that we betrayed our friends.  Oh Or I get arrested and give birth in a super max prison and Oh, wait.  Does the baby grow up in prison or Hello, old friend.  What the shit, Archer? Hang on.  I knew you\'d shoot without looking.  Oh, really, you know me that well? Well enough to know you\'re down here wondering if witness protection ever sends people to the Virgin Islands.  Well, in case you\'d forgotten, I have an unborn child to think about! Jesus Christ, Lana, who can forget? It\'s baby this, baby that.  Aw Baby Archer, who\'s a jeawous baby? What? Holy shit, do you have anemia? No.  Uh, edema, hypertension, preeclampsia, Braxton Hicks contractions, pica? GERD? Lana, do you have GERD? How do you know about the various possible complications of pregnancy? Archer? Maybe I looked it up.  Why? I was concerned about you.  Blow me! Just making sure you\'re not into preggo porn.  Oh, God damn it! That can\'t be a thing! It is absolutely a thing, and do you just not have the Internet, or I have Minitel, okay? A, not the Internet, B, only works in France, Lana.  Okay, um, thanks for your concern, and I don\'t know what you think you heard about witness protection, but They don\'t make babies grow up in prison, Lana.  Yeah, right? They take them away the minute they\'re born and send them to an orphanage.  No, not the minute they\'re That very minute, Lana! They don\'t even dry them off! So if I were you, I\'d run out that door while I still had a chance.  But Archer, I I\'d also waste five precious minutes of my head start in the race to freedom giving that swell guy Archer a combination good bye/thank you blowjob.  Asshole.  Yeah, or a rim job.  What do you care? You\'re never going to see him again.  I can\'t.  I know.  I was kidding, stupid.  I mean I can\'t leave you, stupid! This is the FBI! Open this door! Well, not now, stupid.  And so, wait.  Where did we land on that blowjob? Sorry, rim job.  Do you hear me? Open this door! Obstructing a federal agent is a felony punishable by up to if said obstruction results in the bodily injury of said agent, which I think may have just happened to said agent\'s rotator cuff.  Twenty years? Lana, look at all that coke! Twenty years is just going to be the Bacos on our prison salad.  Besides, technically, Woodhouse is the one obstructing.  Archer! Relax.  They don\'t send people that old to prison.  It costs, like, two grand a day just to keep them alive.  I\'m talking about us! Hmm.  I don\'t know.  Depends who you ask, Lana.  Liberals say this much, conservatives say this much So, now you\'re just dicking around? Yes.  Between the FBI and a ton of cocaine.  Yes.  So, can I assume you have a plan? Yes.  I mean, I don\'t, but you can Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! I\'m coming! Said Ripley to Ow! God damn it, woman! Come on! Why are you slowing down? Need Got to More cocaine.  So, please don\'t take this the wrong way, because I\'m loving being your Esmeralda, but you may have a problem.  And it sounds like the solution is more cocaine, so turn left up there.  But why are you leaving? They can\'t compel a husband and wife to testify against each other! Oh, yeah? They may not have to compel me.  And what is that supposed to mean? Why don\'t you ask that guy you never heard of, Len Trexler? How can I? I\'ve never heard of him.  You wouldn\'t know the truth if it bit you on the ass and held on, would you? Ron, wait! What? Well, if you insist on being an ass, I can\'t stop you, but there is the small matter of my putting the deed to my apartment in your name.  It\'s your loss! I\'ll mail you your furs.  Don\'t you dare! At the very least, I insist on a bonded courier! Ron? Ow! Lana, cut it Ow! What\'s this door made out of, Mithril? Just once, why can\'t you take anything seriously, just once? I was serious about that rim job.  Ow! Seriously, please stop hitting me.  What the Oh, thank God! Cyril? Wait.  How did you This house is insane.  And scary and gross, and I\'m pretty sure I smelled a skeleton.  No, you definitely smelled a skeleton.  Well, this is great! How? I inhaled skeleton! Because now the coke is getting eaten by Pam! Quick, make the wall spin around again! It just kind of spun by itself! Jesus Christ, have you people never even heard of Scooby Doo? Oh, come on! Uh, Pam? Ah, crap.  Oh, my God.  That\'s so freaking unsafe.  Okay, Krieger, Cyril, get in there, and we\'ll spin you back around.  Archer Why do I have to go back in there? Because I said so! Yeah, plus skeletons? Archer? Got it.  Oh! God damn it! Godspeed, you meddling kids.  And sir, I\'m afraid your breakfast will be four minutes late.  Yeah, duh, I already berated you.  Woodhouse, get away from the door! God damn it! Just what do you people think the letters FBI stand for? I bought a T shirt once where it stood for "Female Body Inspector. " God, is Myrtle Beach not the best? Pull a stunt like this again, you\'ll never make it back to Myrtle Beach.  I probably wasn\'t going to, anyway.  Turns out it\'s actually not the best.  And you actually have no right to search this house.  As you can see, there\'s nothing illegal going on.  Maybe not now, but I know you still have a lot of international contacts from your ISIS days.  Mexico, Colombia, the Orient.  I bet it wouldn\'t be too hard to get set up in the drug trade.  Well, you\'d be We\'re not drug dealers, Agent Holly.  Good, because I\'ll be watching you like a hawk that\'s been bred with an eagle.  To produce some sort of eagle eyed super hawk.  With a badge.  So, am I crazy, or is he super weird? Well, I\'m torn, Lana, I really am.  I want to say both, but I also don\'t want you to stop my heart again, so Who\'s da widdle baby? Who\'s da widdle baby? Who\'s da widdle baby? Yes, he is, widdle, little baby! Wait.  The brain chip is in there? I told you it was small.  Said Ripley to the No, doesn\'t work there.  Yeah, it\'s crap.  Okay, I actually only have one brain chip, so Who\'s our lucky winner? Hmm.  I guess we have to decide if we want regular lame Cheryl and a Pam who\'s not going to overdose on cocaine and die, or potentially famous country singer Cheryl and a Pam who Tits.  Flip a coin? No.  And, yeah, he\'s a weirdo, but I think Agent Holly\'s right.  We do have a lot of international connections.  So, I\'m thinking I should take a trip down old Mexico way, maybe Colombia, or even Southeast Asia, or Hey, where\'s Ron? Never heard of him.  Lana, let it go.  Jesus.  But maybe we should try to sell out to an international cartel.  But let me be clear.  You won\'t be gallivanting around under the pretense of work just to visit the fleshpots of the world.  This isn\'t ISIS.  No, I And it definitely isn\'t your semester abroad.  What? Come on, that\'s Hey, I don\'t think we need to go into all the Cobra whiskey and lady boys.  I mean Ha! Shut up.  You shut up! And Krieger? I trust the brain chip implant was a success? I think.  I mean, it\'s in there and she\'s alive.  Now we just have to wait to see if there are any adverse side effects.  Uh Cheryl? Nah, Cheryl\'s gone.  I\'m Cherlene now.  And if somebody don\'t fry me six goddamn eggs and some Carolina fries, I would personally be shocked, shocked, I tell you, if by morning this place ain\'t burned to the ground.  And I\'m not a doctor, but, I mean, I\'m definitely a doctor, so.  No, I think we\'re good.  Yup.  yup, yup.  Happy New Year 2015   New Year, New Color ; )Okay, specs are all in the green.  So let me just reboot the CPU and Beep boop.  You are no longer a cripple.  One, two, three.  Well? Well? Well, you could\'ve done this weeks ago, so it\'s about goddamn time! Ooh! Hang on a sec.  Yeah, touchy thing, bionics.  You were saying? Thank you.  No, what were you saying like you meant it? Thank you, Krieger, for once again giving me the precious gift of legs.  You\'re welcome.  Now, if you will excuse me, I need to remove my underwear with a blowtorch.  Ha! Perfect, this is absolutely perfect! Cherlene! Ow! Come on! Seriously, thanks for the deaf baby.  Oh, shut up What? Goddamn, woman, inside voice! How would you, my little country songbird, like to be on Travis County Limits? Ooh! ls that like Austin City Limits? It\'s comparable, hush.  Cherlene? I don\'t know.  I guess.  You would be wonderful, and it would be wonderful publicity, and wonderful! All right, when is it? It tapes tomorrow night, but we should leave today.  I don\'t want you flying the same day you\'re performing.  Oh, don\'t worry about that because Cherlene don\'t fly.  Airplane air is so dry, plus you\'re breathing in God knows what those tuberculars in coach are.  Excuse me? I don\'t fly.  But I\'ve seen you fly! Well, maybe you saw Cheryl fly.  In a helicopter, the space shuttle.  Cyril choke banged you on a blimp? Oh, come on, we were all thinking it! What, how are you all so goddamn loud? Could you not find a punch bowl? It was too heavy.  And also too spilly.  Now, what\'s with all the yelling? I booked Cherlene on Travis County Limits ls that like It\'s comparable! But it\'s tomorrow night and she refuses to fly! Wait, really? So you\'ve only got Well, 36, but But after we get a bus and a blocker car, it\'ll be 24, right? What? Oh, God, no.  Yes! Archer? Lana! Sterling! What are you talking about? Smokey and the Goddamn Bandit.  What? We\'re going eastbound and down I will never understand his idiotic fascination with all this Burt Reynolds, Smokey trucker nonsense.  I think part of it is because you didn\'t get him that C. B.  McHaul toy truck he wanted for his birthday.  He was 30! Happy New Year 2015   New Year, New Color ; ) And words fail me.  I have no words.  How about 10 goddamn four? How about how much did this cost? How about a Jacuzzi, bitches? Whoo! You know what they say, you can\'t put a price on free advertising.  No, they don\'t, and free this isn\'t! Exactly.  How much are they paying Cherlene? It\'s public television, they don\'t pay anything! All they do is suck money in! They take our taxes Or donations, or whatever.  Of pre tax dollars! From pot taking Bolshevik lesbian couples! Then PBS mixes it all in with their huge NEA grants, launders it in inner city methadone clinics, and pumps it right back out to pro abortion super PACs! Still no words.  And, wow, maybe I have aphasia.  Where do you think you\'re going? She\'s driving the bus, Mother, get on the bus.  Lana, you\'re riding with me.  In what? In the blocker car, duh, if Cyril didn\'t just break the stupid axle.  The what? Okay, first of all How much did that cost? Well, again, it\'s advertising, so For what? Hmm.  I guess Pontiac? God.  And where are you going? Well, speaking for the tiny, delicate life blossoming inside me, nowhere in a car with T tops and a four barrel.  Who\'s going to do snappy dialogue with me, underscored by sexual attraction? I\'m so angry right now I can\'t even Oh, God damn it! Did you fart in that? Damn it, Cyril, slow down! Cyril, do nothing of the sort! Because if we miss that taping, I won\'t be responsible for my actions.  Are you ever? She said, single and pregnant.  Oh, wait.  Can you two please go anywhere else? It\'s bad enough I have to drive 24 hours straight.  Well, Krieger said he needed Ray\'s help on some sort of project.  This quit being funny two hours ago! It\'s not supposed to be funny! So shut up and drive the damn bus! Sorry, I\'m a bit stressed out about Cherlene getting a record deal.  Right, and your 10% of it.  Or 50, or whatever.  What? Fifty? Really? Who\'re you, Colonel Mom Parker? Nothing? Meh.  And not that I care what any of you think about anything, but I lost everything when the feds took ISIS, and Ron took what little I had left, so now I need to make it back somehow! And I\'m not doing that selling cocaine, thanks to Sterling, who, unbelievably, is even worse at this than at spying! Hey, so Yeah, hi, I think maybe somebody\'s holding down the talk button thingy? Oh! Sorry, Archer.  Exactly the opposite of how it works.  What? Oh! Sorry, Archer.  Ten four, good buddy.  Sterling? Well, he can\'t hear you now, I Ow! Ow! Whose ring is that, the pope\'s? Shut up.  Seriously, though.  I\'m sorry you heard her say that, that\'s gotta be a real knee to the old emotional nut sack.  Well, I guess it would be, if A, I weren\'t the world\'s greatest spy.  Shut up, and B, if they weren\'t sitting on 100 pounds of coke! What? Affirmatory, good buddy! Holy dickburn! So you got a buyer lined up in Texas and everything? Well, not exactly, or at all, but Pam, come on, we\'re talking about Texas.  Somebody somewhere wants enough cocaine to forget they live there.  Yeah, but not Maybe we\'ll get lucky, find an entire town that wants to commit suicide.  Wonder if there\'s a state wide database of towns with sucky high school football teams cross indexed with towns a black person just moved to.  Jesus, Pam, l was kidding.  Me too, lickbag.  Well, but see if there is one, just for shits and giggles.  So, hey, speaking of The hat fart was technically a shart? How are you still single? Right?   Cyril!   What? God damn it! I\'m sorry! What the hell is going on up here? I must\'ve dozed off! Really? You don\'t just hate signs? No, Lana, I don\'t Ow! In addition to sushi, booze and soft cheeses, I\'m also supposed to abstain from bus crashes.  So stay awake.  I\'m trying, but 18 hours? I don\'t know how Pam\'s doing it.  Seriously? Whoo! What the Hey, sleepyhead! Welcome to Texas! Already? What the shit, Pam? That\'s how we do backseat drivers.  I was driving! Yeah, and sucking at it.  God damn it.  How long was I out? Like 12 hours.  Five states, a dozen cupcakes, a bunch of truck stops.  Breaker, breaker, you got your ears on, Snowball? Come back.  Hang on.  Your handle is Snowball? Like Jerry Reed\'s character in the Smokey verse? Who? Oh.  ls it from the cupcakes? Cupcakes? No.  Then what\'s it Truck stops are crazy awesome! This is Snowball, good buddy! Might want to check your six, Snowball.  Ew.  Is that about the shart? What? No, lickbag! It was a reasonable assumption.  What the Looks like you got a chain gang knocking on your back door.  Bikers? What the hell do they want? I think they want us to pull over! Obviously, you idiot!   But why?   Kidnapping! It\'s a kidnapping, it\'s a kidnapping, to kidnap me, Cherlene! Why would bikers want to kidnap you? Why would anyone? Yeah, you\'re not even famous.  Yet! Duh.  Neither was Frank Sinatra Jr.  Now pull over! We are not Hey, Treebeard! Take me with you! You can do unspeakable things to and/or on me! You\'re not getting kidnapped just to boost your singing career! Well, now, wait a minute.  Wait a minute! Did you tell anybody we were hauling a shitload of coke? Uh Maybe? Maybe? Or definitely, or whatever.  God damn it, Pam! I wanted people to like me! People who like you because you have cocaine aren\'t people you want as friends, Pam.  And not to sound elitist, but neither are people who need a roll of quarters to take a shower! It\'s not just a shower, it\'s more communal, like a Japanese onsen, or Wow! I didn\'t think it was possible, but I somehow just got even angrier! What the heck are you looking for? Gun! Gun, gun, gun, gun, Cyril, look out! No! They\'re shooting at them! And I\'d love nothing more than to shoot back, Pam, but somehow I can\'t find my gun! Huh.  For the love of God, just pull over! Uh, okay! Cyril, do not stop this bus! Okay! Let\'s just give them Cherlene, that is the very definition of a win win! Yes! Why do you always ruin everything for me? Why do you always never shut up? Because where the hell is my gun? Are you, like, sure you brought it? Move.  Oh, shut up.  Seriously.  Where\'s my gun, Pam? What, did you spit it in some trucker\'s mouth, too? Okay, so, apparently a big thing at truck stops is a game called craps.  And apparently I\'m not good at it.  Lana, Lana, Lana! Thank you, Cyril.  I have eyeballs! Yeah, bitch, that\'s how I roll, shit! Because even a goddamn baby knows in craps you never bet on the hard way.  Ow! Oh Shit! Shit! You mad? Give you three guesses, Pam.  No? No? No? Wrong, Pam.  Although I bet I\'m not as mad as Mother\'s going to be when I tell her this was all your fault! Come on, Archer, don\'t do that! That\'s not what good buddies do.  Okay, first of all, you have wildly misjudged our relationship! Archer! Lana! Yeah, you\'re one to talk.  And you\'re lucky I don\'t have my gun! And just why the hell don\'t you? Yeah, tell them why that is, Pam! Oh, come on, please? Oh! I didn\'t think l would need it.  You didn\'t think? Well, it\'s a good damn thing I ain\'t paying you to think! Yeah, you\'re not actually pay Ow! The quite soon  to be number one country singer in America? And you don\'t think I\'m a kidnapping risk? Wait, you do? Yeah, I\'m with Archer, I think those bikers just wanted to rob us, or What? I mean, that\'s just absolutely crazy, we have nothing! Well, l would like to revisit this whole kidnapping idea when we have more time, but she still has a show in two hours and we\'ve still got l think about And one extremely flat tire, so.  Fix it! I will be on my tour bus, putting whiskey and glue inside me.  You heard her.  Fix it.  Yeah, you guys chill on the bus, I\'ll help lickbag here change the tire.  Sorry, I had to sell it.  Chop, chop, get the lead out, lickbag! And what\'s with the "lickbag stuff? It\'s your CB handle! I told it to everybody from here to Kentucky! Good buddy.  Okay, that\'s got it.  Well, it took you long enough.  Yeah, Mother, nine whole minutes start to finish, what an incompetent boob.  Your words.  You know Can we freaking go already? Yeah, what you waiting for, lickbag? Ahem.  Ten four.  So, I think we may have a problem.  Yeah, no shit.  I keep waiting for her to have a heart attack, but Not Pam.  Yay! The cops.  Boo! Oh, shit! Yeah, I\'m going to pull over No! No! Curtain is in 10 minutes! What do you want me to do, run from the cops? I want you to take that exit for the venue! Let Sterling deal with this in that ridiculous blocker car.  Yeah, good, you guys get outta here, we\'ll lure them away and outrun them! In this shit heap? Are you nuts? Are you? You want them to get pulled over with 50 pounds of cocaine? What? What? Or kilos, or whatever.  You put 50 kilos of cocaine on this bus without my permission? Sterling? You have to press the button.  The what? You dated Burt Reynolds! They don\'t have the coke, lickbag! We do! Right here in the Trans Am! Well, then, problem solved.  So, I have a question.  I switched the coke in Little Rock, \'cause I was worried that That because of your fat blabbering mouth, Lana would get caught with it and have to have her baby in prison? Or because you were low on cupcakes? Does the why really matter? Eastbound and down Loaded up and trucking We gonna do what they say can\'t be done! We got a long way to go And a short time to get there Check it out, lickbag, Cherlene wrote a song about us! What She didn\'t write a That\'s from Smokey and the God damn it! What the shit, Snidely Whiplash? Now both of our cars are messed up! I just leveled the playing field! Oh, my God, I can\'t feel my face! Gee, Pam, l wonder if that\'s got anything to do with your cocaine only diet! Well? It\'s a small price to pay for beauty! Damn it! Man, and here you are without your gun, that\'s pretty ironic, huh? No, Pam, once again you\'re confusing the word "ironic" with "You are an idiot!" What\'s ironic is that every other store we drive by is a gun shop! Oh.  Okay, so then what\'s satire? Nobody really knows! Hang on! And then back up a second, you\'re endangering your life for beauty? Yes, duh! Look, how hot am I now? Let me answer that for you! As balls! That\'s why everybody likes me now! Who, your trucker buddies? They only like you because you have coke, Pam.  Well, and the snowballs, but And for what it\'s worth, we all kind of liked you the way you were! Really? Well, we hated you less.  You kind of turned into a ginormous asshole.  Yeah, with ginormous big tittays.  For Pam, who cares? That\'s just subcutaneous adipose tissue! Albeit a shitload of it.  But I can\'t bang you if you die from an overdose! Aw! You wanna bang me? Obviously! I mean, look at those big bastards! Sucks we\'re gonna go to prison, though.  Prison? But it\'s my first offense! Well, except for treason.  But explain all that to the Brazos County judge, and maybe he\'ll Wait a minute, we\'re in Travis County! Why does their car say "Brazos County"? Give you three guesses! Crooked cops? Yes! Hang on! I still got two Pam, get the coke! Yeah! Holy coke snacks, enable the shit out of me! Not to snort, you idiot! Well, I don\'t wanna shoot it, that seems like a pretty slippery slope! Pam, any cocaine is a slippery slope! It\'s the world\'s most addictive drug! Hang on, I heard it was nicotine.  It may very well be, Pam! But in our current situation, I would argue that cocaine is more dangerous, because we\'re about to get murdered for it! Yeah, but not overall, is what I\'m Pam! They don\'t want us, they just want the coke, so throw it! Out! Of the car? Pam! Jeez, okay! But you\'re gonna owe me! What could I possibly owe you? I believe there was some mention of bone throwing? Okay, yeah, that seems like a win win.  Whoo hoo! Thank you! Good night, Travis County! There will be no encore! Whoo! Wait, what? Outlaw country! No, no, no, you don\'t walk off after one song.  You get back out there this instant.  What are you doing? Uh, it\'s called cultivating mystique.  But It\'s also called sniffing a shit ton of glue in my tour bus hot tub because I personify outlaw country.  The Outlaw country! Whoo! Howdy, Tony Foti, Stringer Records, and I wanna make that little gal famous! Are you her manager, Mrs Oh, no, it\'s actually Ms.  It\'s actually Mrs.  Will you put a It genuinely does not matter.  But gimme a call when y\'all are ready to make some gold records.  Yee haw! Ooh! Well, that went better than expected.  Yeah, maybe you can use the gold records to pay Archer and Pam\'s bail.  I actually don\'t think you can.  Plus, there\'s no need.  Wait, what? Sterling! Yeah, no, everything is totally fine now, and we totally got away.  So, all set.  Yes, but how? The police were right behind you.  Which is right where I wanted them, so I could go old school Bandit.  With an inverted triple Needham.  Well, it was your own fault for bringing cocaine without asking, but I suppose all\'s well that ends well.  Well, except for Pam? All\'s well that ends well.  Oh.  Right.  But what about the 100 pounds of coke you dumped on the highway? What? Pam! Looks like old Snowball done it again! Happy New Year 2015   New Year, New Color ; )Got too much time and nowhere to go But I drink enough to say hello I\'m not in love with anyone But I\'m high enough not to give a God damn it! Cut! Okay.  Whoa! Cut it, fellas! Man, I am blowing this jug.  What the hell is wrong with you? You are what\'s wrong with me! It\'s 5:50 in the goddamn morning! Uh, duh! It\'s called the golden hour.  The The light takes on a special quality.  I know what it means, but Then you know it\'s the best time to record stuff, so Film! It\'s the best time to record things on film.  It cannot possibly have any effect on recording audio.  Oh! Was I supposed to be recording that? Krieger! God damn it.  We\'re losing the light! We\'re not losing me blowing this jug.  Are you bothering them? l am, and also, happy Opposite Day.    Is she bothering you?   Yes! Stop bothering them.  They\'re the ones They are trying to make a record, Lana, and there is a finite amount of golden hour.  Which, again I know, but if Cherlene\'s happy Outlaw country! Whoo! Whoo! Exactly.  Then I am happy.  Or at least I will be, once we start selling some records.  I\'ll be happy when I can sleep without getting up to pee every six minutes.  You think you\'re not sleeping now? Wait till that thing\'s born.  So do yourself and those bosoms of yours a favor, and get a wet nurse.  That cannot still be a thing.  Preferably one who cooks.  We had a Dominican, just lovely.  Bosoms like Well, like yours, but umpteen babies later.  My God, Sterling loved her.  She was with us nearly four years.  Now what was her name? I want to say Mariela.  Maricela? Wait.  Or Ruby? I don\'t The point is, they steal from you.  It\'s just the cost of doing business.  Oh.  Steal what? We haven\'t been paid in months, Malory.  I\'m pretty much broke.  Join the club.  Because believe me, if I had the money, I would get the hell out of this hillbilly Hilton.  Am I supposed to be recording this? Krieger! Watch it! God damn it! Whoa! Ow! Jug down! As difficult as that would be.  I\'ma plant a red fern for you, jug.  Happy New Year 2015   New Year, New Color ; ) Item one.  Woodhouse, scrape.  Yes, ma\'am.  And gripe all you want, but no one is eating eggs, Woodhouse, until you people start bringing in some money! But they were already cooked.  What good does it do to throw them away? None! That\'s the whole point.  And no cocaine donuts for you! Oh, come on! I got to load up my body before Krieger sells it all.  Before what? Krieger\'s selling the cocaine online.  Are you insane? Yeah, if it\'s insane to use an X gen asymmetric onion router and digital cryptocurrency to sell your cocaine anonymously and completely risk free.  Or a lot of the other shit I do.  But So do people e mail you, or No.  It\'s like shopping online, only for cocaine.  I\'ve already sold, wow, almost 800 grand worth.  Really? But how do we get paid? With a totally untraceable digital currency that we can exchange for real US dollars whenever we want.  I call \'em Kriegerrands.  And then how do they get the cocaine? We pack it up and ship it.  Easy peasy.  At least in theory.  Oh, for I\'ll send up some help.  And, missy, you had better watch it.  Jesus, these taste like calluses.  Ew! Gross.  That\'s so accurate.  Lana.  Lana.  La What\'s up her gigantic giant ass? Probably you shitheads! What did we do? Besides keeping everybody up all night with your damn hootenannies Wait, that was a hootenanny? Has anybody even thought about throwing her a goddamn baby shower? Ew! You mean a bastard Ow! Cyril, shut your pouthole, accept the fact that Lana was so far out of your league that impregnating her would\'ve basically been interspecies breeding, and get on with your life! And then go get a cake.  Okay, Ray Ray, Cyril, go help Krieger pack the cocaine.  Uh, Cherlene, go pick or grin or something.  And the rest of you We\'re throwing Lana a baby shower.  We haven\'t done that yet? I said move, people! Go.  so.  so.  so.  90! Idiots.  All right, I need them here making music and packaging cocaine, so this baby shower is up to you.  Don\'t cock it up like you did Texas.  Hey! Oh, blow it out your ass! I was hoping you\'d do that.  Okay, we should make a list.  Item one, some paper to write said list on.  Item two Woodhouse! Get in here! Sir? Here, here\'s 400 bucks.  Go get all the stuff for a baby shower.  Cake, decorations, some of those water guns shaped like dicks.  I think that\'s bachelorette parties.  Really? Wow.  Okay, that explains Uh Never mind.  And, Woodhouse, if you spend any of this on heroin, you better buy enough to OD on because Will do! Will don\'t! Wait, so if Woodhouse is getting everything we need for the party, then Oh, not everything, Pam.  Because you and I are going to get Kenny Loggins to play Lana\'s baby shower.  God damn it.  Pam.  Pam.  What? Danger zone.  Wait, wait, wait, no.  This is it.  Yeah, you guys box it up, I slap on a mailing label from the printer, bing, bang, boom, it\'s good to go zoom.  So, why are we in our underwear? Eh.  Don\'t worry about it.  Because it kind of seems like this is about you and not really about Lana.  Okay, A, Lana loves Kenny Loggins.  Really? I don\'t know.  I mean, I assume she does.  I do.  Whoa, whoa! Where you think you\'re going? Uh, well, to give Mr.  Loggins his wardrobe.  Not without a pass you\'re not.  Yeah, we Hey, I appreciate you\'re just doing your job, but if Kenny doesn\'t get this embroidered hippie shirt and these gigantic bell bottoms, I highly doubt you\'ll have a job tomorrow.  Look, he ain\'t even here.  He\'s probably still at the Tuntmore.  Now, was that so hard, neck nuts? Good instincts back there, Pam.  That\'s what we field agents call Hmm.  Guess I\'m not a field agent anymore though.  Man, you got to miss it.  What a rush! Yeah, I miss it, but calm down.  Jesus, it\'s not like you killed a guy.  Taxi! Okay, so phase two may call for some field craft.  A, there\'s no way a superstar like Kenny Loggins is gonna be registered under his own name.  Yeah.  It\'s not like he\'s Messina.  Don\'t do that.  Don\'t ever do that! Sorry.  Jeez! You should be.  Jim Messina is a genius, and without him, no Poco.  Where was I? Oh, yeah, we\'ll probably need to access the computer terminal at reception, so just follow my lead.  Could I just follow Kenny Loggins? Wha Well, maybe because it\'s in the rider, which I\'ll be happy to come down there and shove up his ass.  Excuse me, Mr.  Loggins? Hi, I\'m Uh huh.  Wha What? Uh huh.  What the shit, Loggins? Ricky, bad touch.  Hands off Mr.  Loggins! Hands off me, Lurch.  Look at my suit.  Zap, Ricky, Zap! Hey Ah.  Ah.  Hang on.  Hit him again.  Wait! No, no, no, no, no! What? I What\'s that? No, no, never mind.  It\'s just a fan.  Oh.   Holy shit zaps! Are you okay? Yeah, and I don\'t know about you, but I\'m gonna be pretty upset if I end up having to murder Kenny Loggins.  Meh.  Yeah, that\'s fair! Kick out the guy whose custom Super 220 wool suit was ruined by Kenny Loggins! And where were you during all that? Oh, man, I was like, "What?" So, what\'s up? What\'s the plan? The plan is shut up and come on.  No, we have to play games at the baby shower.  There\'s Don\'t Drop the Baby, Dirty Diaper Game What in God\'s name is the Dirty Diaper Game? Oh, my God, it\'s hilarious.  You get a bunch of newborn diapers, then you microwave different candy bars Stop! Yeah, let me just stop you there, because if you finish that sentence, I\'m going to rub cocaine in your eyes until you are blind.  God damn, Shawshank.  Uh, Malory? Wha What? What do you want? Jesus.  I, um Okay, so, as you know, or should know, I\'m pregnant and Lana, it\'s too late to Okay, let me stop you.  Having the baby.  Don\'t know why that\'s such a mindbender for everybody, but Well But Hush.  I have a lot of pretty major expenses coming up, and since we haven\'t been paid Oh.  Look, I hate to ask, but l need WIC! What? It\'s like welfare, but for babies.  I don\'t know, I\'m not a Democrat.  But I think they give you a birth cheese.  A birth cheese.  Oh, for Nothing\'s ever good enough.  Sorry, I only had $200.  Not you.  Really? $200? Okay, there\'s $200 for the uniforms, $100 for the sweet wigs, and another $300 for Kenny Loggins\' room number.  So, I\'m curious, why didn\'t you just call Cherlene who owns the hotel? Oh.  And I\'m curious, why didn\'t you remind me about that until just now? You said shut up, J.  Alfred Gotrocks.  What? We haven\'t been paid in forever.  Where are you getting all this money? I sold some artwork.  God damn it! What did I tell you about staying up on the wall, ghosts? Okay, since I am, or was, a world class secret agent, when we get up to his room, do actually follow my lead or Hang on, let me grab a name tag.  Ruby! Ruby! Is there a Ruby? See if there\'s a Ruby.  Is there a Ruby? It\'s pretty close to Ruby.  No, Pam, it isn\'t.  Well, why do Don\'t worry about it.  Let it go.  And give me one of those mints.  Dude, they\'re cocaine.  Oh.  Of course they are.  Right? All right, here\'s the penthouse.  Now, I cannot stress this enough, Pam, follow my lead.  Okay.  Room Housekeeping! What did I just Prostitute! What the hell is your problem? Besides my face hurts? Why do I pay you I don\'t want to read about Kenny Loggins, I want to read about K Log.  Jesus, don\'t ever get a publicist.  Well, as a lowly room service waiter, I probably won\'t, but Whoa! Okay.  K Log didn\'t order room service.  Sure, you did.  No, I didn\'t.  A housekeeper and/or prostitute? You think K Log needs to pay for sex, do you? No, but that being said, I do think he needs to reevaluate this whole K Log thing.  Oh, yeah? Well, I think you need to reevaluate your face.  My Oh! Okay.  I can explain that.  How? Uh Lip chemo? It\'s the crazy guy from the lobby! Which means you\'re no prostitute.  And that being said, I am open to blowjobs for money.  I only got 8 bucks on me, but Pam! Self esteem, buddy.  Come on.  Now, let\'s just put the gun down and. .   Mr.  Loggins, please advise.  K Log.  K Log, damn it.  Yeah, I\'m kind of with him on that one.  Oh, really? So you agree with Borgnar\'s pathetic little errand boy? Wait, what? And also who? Well, I\'ll tell you the same thing I told Borgnar that night in Caracas.  It\'s not for sale.  At any price.  Who the hell is Hyah! Ricky, attack! Yeah, Ricky.  Ooh! Aah! Okay.  Okay, good.  Pam, are you good? Oh, yeah.  Yeah, good, okay.  \'Cause this time, I may actually murder Kenny Loggins.  Wait, wait, wait! What, Pam? First see if he wants a beej.  Loggins! Loggins! Now, look, before either of us does something we\'ll both regret, let\'s Okay, that\'s just unacceptable.  Pam, I\'m going in! Okay! Wow! He really likes the Paco Rabanne.  Tell Borgnar I\'ll see him in hell! Urn What the shit, Loggins? Wonder if it\'s too late to get Messina.  Holy shit.  What kind of colossal idiot would build a pool like that? I just want to go on record as saying that a glass swimming pool on the penthouse balcony is, without a doubt, the absolute worst idea that I have ever heard in my entire goddamn life.  But you\'re the men, so But can you imagine banging in that thing? Why, yes, Archer, yes, I can.  Drop it! Drop it on the ground.  Do you know how bad that is for it? I will place it on the ground, but You think K Log won\'t shoot, punk? No, I think K Log is out of bullets.  What? How did you It\'s just a thing I do.  Now what the hell is in that briefcase? As if you don\'t know.  I honestly don\'t.  Liar.  Look, I put my weapon down.  I\'m not a threat.  How would I know what\'s in Pam, no, no, no.  Don\'t, no, don\'t Shit.  Ooh! Okay.  So one of One fairly predictable thing is gonna happen now, so Loggins! You saved me.  But why? What do you mean, why? I wanted you to play a baby shower.  Wait, what? The Dirty Diaper Game, water guns shaped like dicks.  A baby shower.  Oh.  So, Borgnar, the briefcase? I don\'t know anyone named Borgnar, and I don\'t want your crazy briefcase.  What the hell is even in that thing? Don\'t worry about it.  Just let it go.  I should let you go.  Look, I\'m, you know Sorry? Um More just embarrassed.  Is there some way I can make this all up to you? A beej! Pam! And no, Kenny Loggins, there\'s no way to make up for almost killing me over a briefcase full of what I can only assume is either plutonium or a human soul.  Although, that being said It\'s in D minor.  Do you know what that is? Or even what chords are? Yes.  Wow.  Snotty.  Okay, fine, so during the boring parts, just scream, "Outlaw country. " Yeah, absolutely not.  Revvin\' up your engines Listen to her howlin\' roar Happy baby shower! Oh, my God, you guys.  Me first, here! It\'s a breast pump.  Go ahead and use it now if you want.

Oh, my God, it must\'ve been a fortune.  Well, I can afford it.  Apparently, Krieger\'s online pharmacy is going gangbusters, so Pardon me, ma\'am.  This was delivered for Dr.  Krieger.  What Not now, you shriveled Wait a minute.  That\'s the cocaine.  So this whole thing was just a sham? Well, only if by "sham" you mean "sham. " Oh.  Krieger! Aah! But you were temporarily so happy! Krieger, get back here! Yeah! They never say hello to you Until you get it on the red line overload You\'ll never know what you can do Until you get it up as high as you can go Wow! This baby shower actually went a lot better than I would\'ve imagined.  Right? And what happened to you? Your present, Lana, is what happened.  And it\'s where, exactly? What, are you kidding? It\'s Right here, miss.  That\'s my crib! Which I want you to have for the baby.  Archer.  Because you\'re important to me, so I made Woodhouse get it from Mother\'s storage unit, because I own him.  Archer.  Archer, that is the sweetest thing anybody has ever given me, ever.  Well, yeah.  But, I mean, the big present, obviously, is Danger Zone.  The Lana, the song.  Highway to the danger zone Right into the danger zone Oh.  Oh, okay.  Danger Zone, Lana.  You know, how I\'m always saying, "danger zone"? Uh Kind of.  Yes.  Well It\'s from a song?

What would you like to call it? Mmm.  Cocaine enthusiast? Is it too late to not have it? Yes! For the jillionth time, I want this baby, so Well, sure, now.  Wait until you\'re waist deep in dirty diapers, or he\'s up with the croup and there\'s no bourbon in the house.  Ugh! Then fast forward to him knocking up the au pair, flunking out of college, and then single handedly bankrupting your drug cartel! Wait, college? Yeah, right? My point is All babies should be drowned? Not all babies.  Just baby people.  Don\'t you have a tractor pull to headline? Yes.  No! Aw No more of that bush league nonsense.  We\'re getting Cherlene a record deal.  Sterling can\'t screw that up.  Look, I think, maybe Archer\'s just been trying too hard.  Ha! I\'m serious.  I mean, as sad as it is, deep down he just wants your approval, and lately you\'ve been putting so much pressure on him.  Well, how hard is it to sell Or whatever we\'re down to now, 1,900 and What? Pam, you damn coke fiend! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Malory, stop! I mean, did you used to be a man? Pam? I don\'t know, did you? Have you been stealing coke? What? No! You think if I had I\'d be sitting here playing choo choo spoon with a tranny? Oh, for the I\'m pregnant! It said, baffling medical science.  Ah! Enough! But Pam, I swear to God, if I find out you\'re lying to me I\'m not! About this! Well, then where the hell did it go? Oh.  You were serious?   Yes!   No! Stop! Archer! Give me! Move your Stop it! Ray! Let me do it! Come on! Just fora minute! No! God damm it! What could go wrong? Uh You could crash it! Just like you crashed the damn space shuttle! Oh, my God, right? Remember that? Ray, you remember? You got paralyzed? How do you not remember that? Happy New Year 2015   New Year, New Color ; ) Oh, my God, Cyril, for the We\'re not just waltzing into Colombia with 100 pounds of cocaine.  We\'re sneaking in, under the radar.  Literally, and figuratively.  Is there a name for that? When it\'s both? Like in French or something? I meant once we get there, your plan is to just ask around for La Madrina, yes, the Godmother.  I know what it means.  I hate I took Latin.  Maybe someday you\'ll meet a mummy.  But what do you think is going to happen when three gringos waltz in and start asking around for the woman who runs the entire Cali cartel? Well, again, Cyril, we won\'t actually be waltzing You know what I mean! I also know what I\'m doing! Yeah, showing mommy who\'s a big boy! What? Oh, you want to see who\'s a big boy? Archer! Take it back! Cyril! Help! Uh Uh Oh! Ow! Ow! I don\'t know where Archer is! Then find him, you bearded buffoon! Use the surveillance satellite! Oh.  You were serious? Don\'t ask her that, she hates it.  ISIS had satellites.  The, whatever we are, Gang Who Couldn\'t Sell Coke Straight doesn\'t even have cable.  But? What about all these? They\'re all aimed inside the house.  Well, what the hell good is that for? I\'m making about 2 grand a month on the Gilfcam.  Ew! The what cam? What is your Hmm.  Dear, Gilf hound 69 Jesus Christ.  Thanks for the concussion, dicks.  Well? Oh, and, just so you know, that\'s exactly how Len Koenecke died.  Who? "Who?" Typical.  God damm it! Will you slow the shit down? I\'m sorry, was there a question? Because nobody made you two come here.  I didn\'t put a gun to your heads.  I mean, not literally to your heads.  So, if you\'ll hide your vaginas it\'s time to gather some intel.  Intel? No, do not compare what we do now to intelligence work.  Don\'t worry, I won\'t! Because selling cocaine to cocaine dealers, doesn\'t really compare to helping overthrow democratically elected governments! Like the US did in Guatemala, Chile, Nicaragua.  Uh Oh! Iran! Because, spoiler alert, those didn\'t really work out so great! But that\'s okay because I\'m pinning my hopes for the future on the next big shipment of Stinger missiles to that ragtag bunch of mujahedeen heroes in Afghanistan! I Wow.  It seems like you\'ve actually given this some thought.  Plus, I mean, it\'s not like we\'re selling cocaine to little kids.  And ISIS did do a lot of bad stuff.  He blew up an oil pipeline.  Not to mention a bunch of people, which, compared to that, this is kind of a victimless crime.  If it even is a crime.  I mean, is it? He said, sucking at being a lawyer.  I\'m actually an excellent lawyer.  And I\'m excellent in the field, so Maybe in ISIS.  But on ISIS missions, you had big dossiers with all the information you could possibly need.  Yeah, but I never read \'em.  What\'s up, pendejos? Goddamn Latin! Just feel like such a tourist.  Colombia? What are they doing in Colombia? I And how did you know where they were? I thought you couldn\'t track them! Ray posted a Snacklesnap.  It\'s where you take artsy photos of your food and share it with people? Snacklesnaps is awesome! Look, here\'s some cocaine pudding.  Here\'s some more cocaine pudding.  Ooh.  Cocaine pudding! Why would anyone want a picture of someone else\'s food? Well, no, they don\'t.  Yeah.  Everybody hates it.  Snacklesnaps But why take cocaine to Colombia? I assume as a sample? To show some cartel boss that our product is high quality and already in the States? Saving them the transport cost.  But those three, waltzing around Colombia with millions of dollars of cocaine! My God, they could already be dead! Oh Malory, come on, this is Archer, okay? He can take care of himself.  Yeah, and I doubt they were actually waltzing.  I\'m sure they\'re totally fine.  Archer! Here\'s to you, Hal Needham! Man, why bother with coke? I just made 100,000 pesos for jumping through a stupid window.  Yeah, that\'s about $50.  Still, though.  You look for The Godmother? Yes, for a very lucrative business proposition.  Do you know her, or No.  But I can make a phone call and someone will come.  Until then, just keep drinking your guaro, huh.  About 15 steps ahead of you.  Hmm? See what I did there? Overdosed on liquid snake? Made a connection, Cyril.  I gained his trust.  Oh, my God! Although now that you mention it, I think I actually may have. .   Oh, God! snake poisoning.  Dammit, Archer! I told you! What\'s that? I can\'t hear you over the sound of, "I have snake poisoning!" Well, it\'s your own fault.  What the What are you Shh! Shut up! I think I heard a troop truck pull up out front! It\'s the army! Shit.  It\'s not the army, we\'re not that lucky.  They\'re paramilitarios.  But, what are they Hey! What are you doing? Waiting for you, and to be honest, having second thoughts about it.  Serious shit, come on! Okay, Ray Who are these paramilitarios? Either heroic vigilantes trying to restore law and order because the cops can\'t or won\'t.  That doesn\'t sound too bad.  Or right wing terrorists with a boner for kidnapping and murder.  That does.  Moot point though, really, if you\'re an American down here selling cocaine.  I can\'t believe that guy ratted us out.  Yeah, and after you made a connection? Now? Really? Well? Shut up.  Ray, hug the shadows, get to the Land Cruiser and be ready.  Don\'t turn it on.  Do not touch the brake pedal.  Cyril, I\'m gonna take out the guard, you\'re going to take the truck\'s distributor cap.  Got it? Uh Okay! Go, go, go! But Look, I realize this is somewhat my fault Cyril.  We can talk about it later.  So, funny story So, hey Sorry in advance for this.  Cyril! Did you get it? Yes! Then come on! Hit it! Cyril! I\'m coming as fast as I can! Guys, we really need to talk about getting phrasing back in rotation.  Hammer down! Oh, I\'m sorry, Ray.  By hammer I meant accelerator.  It\'s floored! And it\'s overheating! Well then stop, you idiot! I am not the idiot who packed the engine compartment full of cocaine! Oh, right.  We should get that out.  Good idea.  That\'ll give us something to do while we sit here and wait for those guys to drive up and murder us.  Ray, they\'re not driving anywhere without a distributor cap,so Cyril, may I see the distributor cap? Phew.  Man, Cyril, you had me worried.  I did? Yeah, see, I always worried I would die without knowing how it felt to get my throat slashed and my tongue yanked out through the gaping hole.  Are we seriously done with phrasing? I mean not right then, necessarily, although tongue and gaping hole were kind of begging for it.  Gaping hole, begging for it Ah Drop your weapon! Drop your weapons! Archer! Are you crazy? They\'ll kill us! Will you shut up? I know what I\'m doing, Cyril.  It\'s all about machismo! Last chance! Okay.  What in the I told you.  All about the machismo! Archer.  Archer.  Archer! What? Oh! Is that the army? I don\'t think so.  One guy\'s wearing a t shirt from a Phi Mu Fun Run.  We called \'em Phi Moo.  Well, then who the hell is it? And I think you have been looking for me, no? Only my whole life.  God damm it.  And you, guapo, you follow me.  Oh.  Yeah, uh, about that So, I have a question.  Since we\'re now essentially captives of the Cali cartel and being dragged off to God knows what terrible fate, why the hell are you smiling? A, we\'re not their captives, we\'re about to be their business partners.  B, I bet there\'s a pretty decent chance La Madrina owns a tiger.  And, C, guapo means handsome.  It\'s your mother.  What? Give me that.  "Putting pressure on him"? If anything I\'ve been too lax, but, please, let me benefit from your vast experience as a mother, and Hey! Hello, Ray? Put Sterling on the   Damn it, Archer! Give it   Give it! Yes! Ray I\'m serious.  I\'m serious.  Archer, cut it out! Give it! Dammit, give it here! Sterling? The voice mailbox of is full.  Goodbye.  If you\'re satisfied with your voicemail greeting, press one.  How did you Remember that day I took your falafel and you were chasing me all around the living room in your wheelchair? Yes.  Yeah, so I recorded that, added some sound effects, mixed it, called my phone and left it as a message, stole your phone, got into the voicemail settings, called your phone from a landline and played the message from my phone, then put your phone back.  Which I think is why it sounds a little compressed, but whatever.  Shut up, we\'re here.  And remember, I got dibs on the tiger.  Well, I have to admit, Mr.  Archer, your proposal is very surprising.  Not as surprising as somebody named The Godmother looking like you.  Really.  And what were you expecting? I guess like a Mexican Mrs.  Garrett? Or Colombian, or whatever, I You talk almost too much.  But you have aroused my curiosity.  Just your curiosity? No.  But first business then pleasure.  Javier.  S, Madrina? If it is as pure as you say, and you have as much as you say Oh, my God, we\'ve got something, like, 900,000 kilos.  Wait, no, that\'s grams, so So 900 kilos.  However many are in a shit ton.  A toast then.  To new friends.  Just friends? No.  So, shall we have sex? Man! How is it noon? And where the heck is Archer? I assume bothering a tiger.  Oh, God.  Please.  Oh, my God.  Aw Are you sure? I was sure three hours ago.  And back then I could still feel my legs.  Are you sure you cannot make love to me just once more? Not without a blood transfusion, no.    Very well.    Ow! Which is why you don\'t bother tigers.  Then you may call me Coronel Ana Maria Delgado, de la Polica Nacional! What? l am, how you say, deep cover.  Wait, no! No, no, no.  At least let me take some churros! As if American demand for cocaine wasn\'t already destroying us, now you even try to smuggle it into my country? You make me sick! Then why\'d you have sex with me? How dare he do that? How could this have happened? So, I get that you\'re mad, but they are in pretty dangerous territory and Ray always answers his phone in the field.  So I\'m actually worried.  Well, if you\'re so worried why don\'t you go down there and rescue him? I Please? Go find my son and bring him home to me.  And I didn\'t even get to meet her tiger.  If she even had a tiger.  Plus at this rate we\'re going to run out of coke, huh? Now there\'s a moot point.  Since we\'re being trucked off to La Culebra, the most notorious prison in South America.  Notorious, Cyril, please, I was in the Lubyanka.  Well, were you sent there by an undercover cop who knows she\'ll be murdered if anyone finds out she\'s La Madrina? No, idiot, l was Oh.  Yeah.  So how long do you think we\'re going to last in prison? Hmm.  If we even make it to prison! Am I right, fellas? Fellas, am I right? Guys, if we get out of this, the first thing I\'m going to do, I swear to God If you say buy a tiger we will beat you to death with your own shoes.  Happy New Year 2015   New Year, New Color ; )Oh, come on, how long are you guys gonna stay mad at me? What, for getting us all arrested for smuggling cocaine into Colombia? Probably the rest of our damn lives.  Which shouldn\'t be very long, since we\'re headed to La Culebra, the most dangerous prison in South America! Well, Cyril, when we get there, and I join the toughest gang, don\'t hold your breath for a bid.  A bid? They\'re prison gangs, not frats.  And don\'t call a fraternity a frat! No, I\'m fine, don\'t worry about me.  And don\'t worry about La Culebra, gringos, you are not going there.  Well, that\'s good.  ls that good? It doesn\'t sound very good.  Why does that sound really, really, really bad? Because they\'re gonna kill us.  What? Unless you got maybe, $100,000 U. S.  on you? Well, not on me, on me, but But when we\'re digging our own graves they\'re gonna get cocky and then we whang \'em with our shovels, right? Cyril, this isn\'t an episode of B. J.  and the Bear.  That was? It\'s the jungle, nobody digs graves, they just kneel you down by a ditch and put a bullet in your Cow! Why would they shoot your Cow! God Damn Well, now I\'m almost afraid to say Eat a dick, jungle.  Happy New Year 2015   New Year, New Color ; ) Easy, easy, careful! Cyril! For the love of Christ, man.  Sorry.  You have to shut up.  I am.  Starting now.  Starting now Cyril? Sorry.  What was that? Probably a jaguar, excited about being magnificent and crepuscular.  But I need you to focus on me, because if by some miracle, I get the keys And then, by some other, even bigger miracle, get us out of these cuffs I am gonna beat the shit out of you, Cyril! I\'m gonna beat the shit outta both of y\'all.  Oh, my God, Ray! You\'re alive? What? Did y\'all think I was dead? Yeah, I totally did.  Well, I just assumed And you didn\'t even take a moment? I mean Screw you guys! Ya know What is in your mouth? Nothing.  It\'s the keys! He\'s eating the keys? Ray, don\'t you eat those keys! I\'m not eating the goddamn keys! Ow! What\'re you doing down there? What do you think I\'m doing? On.   Sorry.    Do me! Do me.  Do me.    Ow! Ow! Ow! Ray! Do me.  Sorry.  Do me.  Please.  First promise you won\'t be mad at me.  I Wait, why would I be mad at you? Because you\'re an asshole! I beg your pardon? Since Cyril\'s not here, I\'m helping Cherlene redline her record contract.  And I think we should move on, they\'re not gonna let you kill a guy.  What about a dwarf? What about Sterling? Wait, he\'s a dwarf now? He\'s missing! With God knows how much of our dwindling cocaine and no one\'s doing anything to find him! If he calls here, my plan, in its entirety, is to ask him where he is.  It has a simple elegance.  Well, have you tried calling him? The mailbox of Ar ar ar archer is full, leave it.  All right! Turn it off! Turn it off! Ar ar ar Archer I cant! It\'s Aw! Aw! Okay, so he forwards his phone here, that\'s easy, then he taps the phone line into the intercom, they\'re both low voltage, no big deal, but that\'s patched into the actual house wiring, obviously 110 AC, which means he must\'ve wired a transformer in the circuit somewhere, but he\'s got all these fake wires in here, that don\'t connect to any ls this all just a game to you people? My God, I\'m broke.  My husband kicked me out of my own home, we\'re running out of cocaine, and on top of all that, my son is missing! Um, okay, if Archer calls, I\'ll No, please, don\'t disturb me, I think I\'m getting a migraine Outlaw country! Whoo! I honestly don\'t know how much more I can take! Wow, I think she seriously might be, like, nearing the end of her rope.  Hey, speaking of rope You want cocaine? Yay! God damn it! How is this my fault? Because why do you always get paralyzed? Because why do you always crash every goddamn vehicle I get in? I didn\'t crash it! That crooked idiot drunk murdering cop did! Yeah, speaking of These guys don\'t look too good.  Well? They\'re gonna look even worse when they\'re jaguar poop! What? We can\'t just leave them here.  As opposed to what, Cyril? You and I sling them over our shoulders and climb 200 feet straight up a cliff, without a goddamn rope? I Wait, where am I in that scenario? I guess getting pooped out of a jaguar! Well, we definitely can\'t leave Ray! We have to! Ray, I\'m sorry.  No, you\'re not! I am, actually, which, whatever, but We are not leaving Ray.  What do you even think you\'re doing? I\'m taking command! Hey! I\'m serious! Oh, my God, okay.  That\'s really funny.  Thanks, Cyril, I think we needed that.  We did, we really did.  Man! Now gimme the goddamn weapon.  You nut.  Thought you were gonna hit me with it.  I was.  Okay, so how do we get Ray and his useless legs out of here? Well, now, I actually have some thoughts on that.  God damn it.  I think it\'s a pretty good plan, y\'all.  No, it isn\'t! We might as well slather ourselves with whatever it is crocodiles eat, and swim down! What do crocodiles eat? Everything! They eat everything! And fear is their bacon bits.  I don\'t understand what you\'re saying.  Damn it! Look, I think Malory is genuinely going through a really hard time right now, so I think we should do something nice for her.  I don\'t understand what you\'re God damn it! I\'m with you, Lana.  It freaked me out seeing her cry like that.  It was like seeing my dad cry.  Crying because Name it, he\'s a gigantic pussy.  Oh, my God, when my mom died? Hey, and speaking of pussies A Long Island Iced Tea? I\'m not even supposed to drink regular iced tea.  Yeah, this is a Long Island.  Yeah, stupid.  Your words.  Shut up, and okay, so what would cheer Malory up, what does she like? Archer and money and liquor.  Besides that.  Some different liquor.  You know what always cheers me up We\'re not giving her cocaine.  I was gonna say cock.  Yeah Ow! You done? l am.  Thank you.  Ass.  And, Pam, that\'s not a bad idea.  Hmm.  I dunno if I\'d be comfortable with that.  I mean, even for me, it\'s Lemme stop you, before you say what it is you think I\'m talking about.  Gettin\' shitty drunk on two different kinds of liquor, dressing up like Mr.  Archer, and banging the old lady with a strap on Ow! That\'s not what I had in mind.  Okay, good, \'cause the dressing up like Mr.  Archer part makes it kinda weird.  I I\'d have to be super drunk, like so drunk I bet I wouldn\'t even enjoy Ow! Okay, so what\'s your plan? Well, eventually we have to come to a village or whatever and maybe we can barter with them for a ride, or Barter with what, Cyril? I dunno, maybe the gun, or Yes! Great idea, yes, Cyril, let\'s give an M 16 to a bunch of wild Indians! Whoa! Hey! God damn, Huckleberry Finn! What? I don\'t think it\'s racist to assume that a previously uncontacted tribe of indigenous peoples might react unpredictably, perhaps even wildly, to a bunch of white guys who walk up and hand \'em a goddamn M 16! Okay, I didn\'t know in your scenario the indigenous people were uncontacted Totally different scenario.  In which No, you obviously wouldn\'t just want to hand them an M 16.  \'Cause they\'d be like "What?" Or whatever their word for that is.  What? A spa day! What? No, I can\'t go out like this No, no, no, that\'s the best part, it\'s here! Then it\'s not a spa day, it\'s just a bath! I want to go back to sleep! Well, after this you\'ll be so relaxed I took three Valium! If I get any more relaxed I will literally die! Okay, well, that\'s also good, because you may not actually find this to be all that relaxing.  What the Why are they dressed like that? That was the only way they\'d do it.  Strip! Yay! Wait, what? Crocodylus acutus! And maybe even Are we in the Orinoco drainage basin? How should I know? Okay, so maybe Crocodylus intermedius is in play.  Not to mention four kinds of caiman, including the black caiman, which can grow up to 22 feet! Is that why you\'re up on those goddamn cans? Yeah, if a big bull croc slithers up on the raft, I\'m gonna pour a ring of gas around me and set it on fire.  Why? Cyril, they can\'t chomp through fire.  Although I have no reason to think that.  Why are you so scared of crocodiles? I dunno, Cyril, maybe deep down I\'m afraid of any apex predator that lived through the K T extinction Uh Physically unchanged for 100,000,000 years, because it\'s the perfect killing machine.  A half ton of cold blooded fury, with a bite force of 20,000 Newtons and stomach acid so strong it can dissolve bones and hoof.  And now we\'re surrounded, those snake eyes are watching from the shadows, waiting for the night Waiting for the night! Damn it, Ray! Keep your voice down.  Why? Crocodiles don\'t have ears.  They absolutely have ears, shithead.  Well, so do I, and you just talked yourself out of a hat.  Jeezy Petes! Way to go, Ray.  Now he\'s got a taste for Shoot it.  Shoot it! I can\'t! Sweet Jesus, God, then at least shoot out my eyes so I don\'t have to see! Oh, my God! What is happening! Huh.  I thought that was gonna be way more epic firebally.  Come on, Cyril, pick one.  Either have a stroke or spit it out.  Were you gonna say "a taste for human flesh"? No, I was gonna say "hat. " But now it\'s not funny.  Well, not as funny.  It\'s all your fault, it\'s all your fault.  Which part, Ray? The part where I flipped our jeep down a cliff about 90 goddamn times because I got drunk to cope with the fact I was about to murder us in the jungle? It\'s your fault we\'re in this stupid jungle in the first place! Well, if we\'re gonna go back to the beginning of time, Mother\'s the one who got us arrested for treason and then bought a ton of goddamn cocaine.  I thought you bought it.  Wait, what? Up! Up! Hands off the goods, mister! Aw! I said that\'s ridiculous, where would I get But if you didn\'t Okay, so where would Archer get that much coke? Who knows with him? Maybe wherever he got that new kind of V. D.  none of the doctors had ever seen before When was that? Yeah, when was that? Seriously, was Trust me, if you had it you\'d know.  I loathe knowing that I had sex with the same person as you two.  You had sex with me! No, I Oh, my God, that\'s right.  Ha! What\'re you laughing at? Oh, my God, that\'s right.  So if you dicks want to blame somebody for our current predicament, blame You! I blame you! Archer! I blame you! J \'accuse! What was that, Ray? Sorry, I genuinely couldn\'t hear you! Jesus, what is wrong with you two? "What\'s wrong"? What\'s wrong is we\'re about to be on fire! Do something! Uh,no? What? Archer! Not until you apologize.  For what? Ray, God damn it, just apologize! I Jesus Christ, I\'m sorry! There, was that so hard? Okay.  What the hell are you Crocodile repellent! What? We gotta swim for it! On three.  No, no, no.  Archer! Sorry, three.  Kick, Cyril, kick! It\'s okay, stupid, I forgive you.  Forgive, yes.  Cannonball! Whoo! Oh, God, I think I swallowed a leech Well, the gas oughta kill that.  You asshole, you could\'ve killed us.  Well? Well, you did set the raft on fire.  Oh, my God, you always take his side! I never, ever, ever take his side! Blah, blah, blah.  Some joke about you two having vaginas, come on, let\'s go.  Go where? Well, long term I was thinking home, short term, I Here, hold this.  Go Herd.  Short term, somewhere that\'s not the crocodile version of a drive thru.  Sounds good, here we go! Uh uh uh.  I got it.  Cyril.  What if I need a gun? Urn Here! Oh, come on.  The only limit is your imagination.  Aw! Look, she\'s almost not terrifying.  Thanks, you guys.  I think the spa day took her mind off Archer being missing, even if it almost got weird.  She made it weird.  No, you did.  Nobody wants an enema.  Some people Not with yogurt.  So, you think those guys are okay? I don\'t know.  I mean, if it were anybody else I\'d say no, but this is Archer we\'re talking about, so probably not.  Oh, for Can you not give it a rest? Not until he admits he\'s been half assing this entire cocaine debacle from the get go.  That\'s only because I thought it was gonna be way easier.  You think everything\'s gonna be easy.  It almost always is.  Aha! See, that\'s what I resent.  What do you resent, Ray, my muscly shoulders poking into your tum tum? I resent how you never take anything seriously, because you just assume everything\'s gonna work out for you.  It almost always does.  Case in point.  What the. .  God damn it.  Do you think those guys are Doctors Without Borders? Yes, Cyril, I do.  I bet those assault rifles shoot polio vaccine.  They\'re narcos, dummy! And that plane\'s probably loaded with coke.  Okay, here\'s the plan.  What? Are you crazy? You\'re outta your mind! We have to get out of the country! So we can either walk out, which no, no, we can\'t, or we can fly out in an airplane full of cocaine! Ray is paralyzed, who\'s gonna fly it? Don\'t Why would you worry about that before you need to? What? Why clog your brain with a bunch of hypothetical maybe what if bullshit? Because Shut up! This is what we\'re doing! So, Cyril, lock and load that stick.  Manos arriba! Nice.  You wanna Oh, right.  Manos Urn Wait, what was it? Arriba! God damn it! Manos arriba! I don\'t think so, gringo.  Drop your weapons! I\'m serious, I will shoot this guy right in the What the hell is that? Suppressing fire! Okay, Okay.  Ow! God damn it, Cyril! Whoo! Oh, geez.  Oh, geez.  Oh, geez.  Sorry.  That\'s why I wanted you to be stick.  Ah ah! Yeah, come on, it\'s been a long day.  Do you have any idea who we are? Nope.  Do you know who we are? No.  Then blow me.  Cyril, make sure it\'s good and tight.  Why are we not still doing "phrasing"? Why are we still not worrying about who\'s gonna fly the damn plane? Oh.  Right.  You are kidding! Okay, Ray, ballpark, how long will it take you to teach me how to fly a plane? How long? I flew the space shuttle Cyril, hush, big guys.  Ray, how long How long will it take you, Archer, to admit you dick around every time we\'re in danger just to screw with everybody, because of your complete No, your utter contempt for your own mortality! I mean, yeah! Duh.  All I wanted.  What.  You could walk this whole time? No, Cyril, of course I\'m not mad I think what Ray did was awesome.  Okay.  Well, then you are an idiot.  Your words.  Which, I guess, so am I, since I just realized we can\'t land anywhere with all this cocaine on board.  Oh, my God, you guys, where are we gonna land? Jesus Christ, woman, calm down! We\'ve got five hours of fuel, we\'ll worry about that when we have to! Guess I\'m rubbing off on you, Ray.  God damn it! What? What? Why are we not doing "phrasing"? Now I\'m coming Now I\'m coming Now I\'m coming Coming home to you Now I\'m coming Now I\'m coming Now I\'m coming home to you Happy New Year 2015   New Year, New Color ; )Woodhouse.  Mum.  If I see this glass empty again, I will be very unhappy.  Perish the thought, mum.  Now then.  Who\'d like to go first? No? All right, then I will.  Idiots! Thank you, dear.  For a moment there, I thought I was going to be unhappy.  Now then.  Who\'s next? Happy New Year 2015   New Year, New Color ; ) Okay, so, uh I guess I\'ll go, if If I can just stop you there.  Will you please cover yourself! With what, I don\'t have any There.  Happy? No! I didn\'t mean with whipped cream.  It\'s actually whipped cocaine, so That explains where some of it went.  Mmm.  And the tingly numbness of my nipples.  And why are you dressed like the whore the rest of the trailer park finally decided they had to stone to death? Duh! We were shooting my album cover.  Yes! Good, yes, that is perfect! Perfect for what? Come on, it\'s an album cover, not an Amish bible.  Ya gotta sex that shit up sexy.  Um I think it\'s pretty sexy.  You think that\'s sexy? With the rocket pops outside of you? I mean But if she eats them, we lose the whole red, white and Okay.  Yeah, not talking about eatin\' em.  Wait, what are you You want me to put a rocket pop in my vagina? Well, for starters.  But let\'s not rule anything out, you know, let\'s see where that leads.  We\'ve got a shitload of film.  I\'m supposed to have film in this? God damn it! Krieger! So, I have a question.  The butthole, Lana, is what I was Yeah, I got that.  But do you think the cover for a country album should be hardcore? What do you even call that, food porn? I do.  You think it makes a good country album cover, or you call it food porn? Yes.  Are you These things are freezing.  Film, film, film, film, film! Quit putting rocket pops in your ass! I\'m eating them! Jesus, what is wrong with you? I guess I just don\'t get art.  You obviously don\'t.  And it\'s not that we don\'t appreciate criticism? It just needs to be constructive.    Yeah, Lana.    Shut up.  And then tell me what happened to the hundred pounds of Kilos.  Kilos.  Kilos, thank you, shut up, of cocaine that you took to Colombia.  Which Lana, when I want you to talk, I will tell you.  And until then, zip it.  Wha What did I do? Nothing! Yeah, Lana.  Which is why these feckless idiots lost 200 kilos of cocaine! Yeah, La Oh! Okay, technically, but then we stole a plane loaded with, like, twice as much cocaine.  Is this the part where you tell me to look under my seat? No, unfortunately, we ran into some Assholishness.  Archer, I swear to God! I will crash this plane right into the goddamn ocean! I\'ll take my chances with the ocean! The ocean isn\'t full of alligators.  And do not even think about it, Cyril.  Ray, what do I do? Uh, I guess hang on.  Sorry, Cyril.  Ow! Oh, shut up, it\'s your own fault.  It\'s debatable.  No, it\'s Shut up, come on, Ray, there has to be somewhere to land besides the middle of the damn Everglades.  Well, not within fuel range, so And whose fault is that? Isaac goddamn Newton! You see that airstrip, the one that\'s circled? That\'s the only one in range, and we\'ve only barely got enough fuel to make it there But Miami\'s right over here.  We can\'t land at a real airport.  Even if Ray had filed a flight plan Why didn\'t you file a flight plan? Wha That\'s like Airplane Stuff 101.  Not when the airplane is stolen and crammed full of guns and cocaine! Oh.  I will concede that point.  Dammit.  What\'s up? What\'s going on? Burning too much fuel.  We\'re heavy.  What do you mean, "heavy"? You said we had enough fuel to I said barely! I bet the Colombians didn\'t count on three passengers! Oh, my God, we\'re gonna crash.  Cyril, do not panic.  Just get out.  What? Do the right thing, Cyril.  You have nothing to live for.  Get your hands off me.  Okay, relax, Jesus.  What ever happened to Team Archer? Please tell me that was never a real thing to you.  Eh I mean Hello! Time\'s a bit of a factor here! Cyril, for the love of God, man, jump! Just throw out the cocaine.  What? No! I\'m not telling Mother I lost the original hundred pounds of Kilos! Kilos! Whatever unit of measurement, of cocaine.  Plus all this cocaine.  Do you have any idea how mad she\'d be? Well, the alternative is a belly landing in a swamp filled with alligators.  No, no, no.  What if, um Archer! Alligators or your mother! What\'s the difference? They\'re both cold blooded prehistoric monsters.  Excuse me? I meant the pain of disappointing you would bite.  Alligator ish ly.  Uh huh.  Anyway, right about then Okay, I can see the airstrip.  Oh, can we make it? Maybe, if you Wait! Ray, you said the Colombians were flying to this airstrip? Yes! Why do you think it\'s marked on the chart, you idiot? Okay well, let\'s circle back to who\'s an idiot and talk about who\'s probably waiting at this airstrip.  Dukes.  And what their reaction will be to three total strangers showing up in their plane without their coke.  They\'ll kill us.  Well, maybe not.  Why maybe not? Wait, why? Because that.  And that.  Happy? What, like, in general, or Ooh! This is exciting.  I hope everyone dies.  Uh, we obviously didn\'t Oh.  Hardy har, Mother.  And so our heroes, such as they are, have run out of fuel and What? No, no, no! What are you doing? Throwing out the guns.  No, no, no, no! You\'re screwing the trim all to hell.  This no phrasing thing is killing me.  Best case, our glide ratio is maybe ten to one! But it\'s a lot less with the damn door hanging No, no, no! Whoo! Whoa, whoa.  Whoa! You idiots! What did I do? Don\'t, there\'s no talking to him when he gets like this.  Dump the damn guns.  Uh, I am, if you\'d shut up.  Wait, wait, wait, Cyril.  What, Archer? We\'re coming in! Brace for landing! Tell ya in a minute.  Gear down! We\'re not gonna make it! Exciting, isn\'t it? Wha. .  Wha Whoa! Oh.  So Cyril What I was gonna say was Maybe don\'t throw out all the guns.  Because you know what they say.  It\'s better to have a gun and not need it than to be the world\'s biggest dickhead, and inside your head, there\'s a million more dicks, like, uh, if you cut open a golf ball, only instead of those little rubber bands in there, it\'s just, you know Dicks? Oh.  So you have heard that? And so Gillette lands safely, I\'m sure there\'s a joke in there about fairy dust, and then what happens? Yeah, tell her what happens next.  I will if you shut your mouth.  Okay, listen up.  Say what you will about my skills as a drug kingpin.  Completely nonexistent.  You don\'t have any.  Are you done? Yes.  Yes.  Good, because if there\'s one thing I\'m good at, out of the million other things I\'m good at, it\'s infiltrating the enemy with an assumed identity.  Named Randy.  Named shut up, it\'s not always Randy.  Oh, my God.  Always.  That\'s because Randy\'s awesome.  And I\'m the best in the world at this, so shut up and follow my lead.  Hey, guys Oh! Anybody else in there?   No.    No.  Sterling, how are you not dead? Because I didn\'t get shot with buckshot, I got beanbagged.  Beanbagged, Pam.  Awesome.  Oh, my God! Yeah, I could\'ve died.  Pfft.  It was a beanbag.  Medical fact, Cyril.  If you get hit in the chest between heartbeats, you can die.  Go ask Houdini.  Ask him what, how to get AIDS? So who were these goons? They were They kinda looked ex military, now that you mention it.  American.  Yeah, and the leader\'s name was Slater.  Just call me Slater.  And sorry about the beanbag.  Man, that must kill.  Yeah, you hear beanbag", you think Beanie Baby, not internal bleeding.  Well, the door was shot off and we didn\'t know who you were.  Still don\'t, I guess, formally, uh Uh, Rando.  Rando.  Yep.  Rando No, that\'s it.  It\'s a mononym.  Like Cher.  Pliny.  Cantinflas! I know what mononym means.  What I don\'t know is who you people are.  Uh, I\'m Rando, I think we covered that fairly well, and these are the, uh, McCracken brothers, Phil and Odie.  Hello.  Odie, hush! So why do you guys have my cocaine? We I\'m not done.  Sorry.  What have you done with Gomez What, you\'re just not gonna answer? Oh! Sorry, you trailed off like there was a third Why do you have my cocaine and where the hell is Gomez, full goddamn stop! Gomez was gonna steal it.  Says who? "Who. " Nice.  Anyway, they called us in to address that.  Which we did, and now we\'re here, and Full stop? Okay, this is the last of it.  The weight\'s good, we tested ten of the bricks, looks like it\'s all here.  Well, either you guys are the shittiest coke thieves on the planet Which we are not.  You know, if that was I mean, if we put our minds to it Look, here\'s the thing about the McCracken brothers.  Odie, hush! You were saying? Hey, between you and me, I thought Gomez was hinky from the get go.  And since the coke\'s all here, let\'s get you fellas loaded.  Yeah, now you\'re talking.  About something else.  Entirely.  Apparently.  What, did you nerf nuts think I was talking about getting drunk? Uh.  Yeah, on money.  Oh, man, classic Rando.  And don\'t worry, Calderon\'s good for the money.  At least for now, am I right fellas? Are you? Classic Rando.  Yeah, Rando\'s awesome.  So, obviously you\'re not gonna be able to pressurize this baby, so I\'ll keep it under 8,000.  Still gonna freeze your asses off.  Good thing you\'re flying south, huh? Mmm, yep.  You do know where you\'re going, right? I absolutely know where we\'re going.  Yeah, back home, to ask Mommy what to do.  Hey, shut up! You shut up! Aah! Ow! Ma, they done killed old Rando! So you leave here with a bunch of the first load of cocaine, which just mysteriously appeared at ISIS and that Malory swears wasn\'t hers Because it most certainly was not.  Wait, then where did it come from? Obviously from Sterling.  Obviously from Mother.  No, not from me! No, not from me! Well, I certainly Well, I certainly Sorry to break that up.  I love Freaky Friday as much as the next gal, but let\'s just press on, operating under the assumption that one, or more likely both, of you are lying, and Lana, I swear Lana, I swear Pressing on.  So then you stumble into another bunch of cocaine in the jungle, and then continue stumbling into a beanbagging arms dealer.  So that now, almost inexplicably, we have enough weapons to invade Quebec.  Wait, literally? No Krieger, not literally.  Lame.  Well, if we ever do, the best time to invade is right after brunch, when they\'re all logy.  Archer? I dunno, it couldn\'t hurt, but Still talking about this.  Not invading Quebec.  Oh.  Yeah, then they loaded the plane with the weapons, said we were heading south and that Calderon would pay us.  Calderon? As in Gustavo Calderon? Should I know who that is? How could you not? I dunno, Cyril.  Maybe I was busy saving your life once, and then you shot me.  Gustavo Calderon, aka Baby Gus, is the president of San Marcos.  Should I know Oh, for God\'s sake, Sterling, it\'s a country.  In Central America.  Mmm, not according to this.  Because that thing\'s a hundred years old.  It still says German East Africa.  We will never recognize Tanganyika.  Well, it\'s Tanzania now, so Lame.  Well, whatever, as long as they don\'t nationalize the ivory trade.  I don\'t think my portfolio can take the hit.  Trust me, San Marcos is a country.  And it\'s in the middle of a civil war.  Communist rebels are tearing through the countryside like Cows.  Bees.  Hang on.  Bees.  How do you not know about San Marcos? It\'s all over the news every night.  from San Marcos tonight, as the Communist rebel forces consolidate their gains on the countryside, and now prepare to move on the capital.  We spoke with President Gustavo Calderon, seen here volunteering at the hospital, comforting the wounded.  Oh, hello, I did not see you there.  I was comforting this brave young man here, the fruit of San Marcos, wounded by a Communist sneeper.  I think he has died.  Yes.  But let me say this, to the Communists who are murdering our brave young fruits, and to their puppetmasters in Moscow and the capital of China, you cannot kill the spirit of San Mar Lame.  As in, who cares? The United States.  Apparently, Calderon is barely clinging to power.  Huh.  You think this is somehow related? I\'m kidding, obviously.  Are you? No, I can\'t tell.  Yes, I\'m kidding.  Because you wanna know what I really think is going on here? You\'re all jealous! My album\'s coming out and it\'s gonna be huge, and you\'re all jealous, and so you just want to ruin it for me! Why would I want to ruin your album? I get 50 percent of the profits.  Archer? I dunno, maybe a little jealous, it\'s an exciting time for her.  This! Still talking about this! Oh.  Right, right, right.  So what I think is I think you\'ve managed to stumble backwards into a CIA backed, anti communist, drugs for arms operation.  Wow! That actually makes more sense.  Than? No, let\'s just go with her thing.  Which, if it\'s true, is Wonderful! I was going to say terrible.  Because you are a timid man, Cyril.  What? No, I\'m not! Dude, your balls are made of pussy.  All kidding aside, I maybe should go to a hospital.  Cyril, this is an opportunity to finally make some money.  Even if we had a buyer for the cocaine, do we even still have half of it left? Eh What? It\'s, urn, you know, not, it\'s Krieger! Tell me what\'s going on or I will literally emasculate you! Well no, if you literally emascu Okay, so, for a few weeks, I\'ve been working on a bit of a side project.  I give you, the Red Kriegtober! Um Or the Red OctKrieger, I can\'t decide.  It\'s a narco sub.  For transporting cocaine.  It\'s totally undetectable by the Coast Guard.  Thoughts? How are you gonna get it out of here? Hmm? How does that thing leave this room? God! Dammit! Oh, for the How much money did you waste on that little boondoggle? Well it\'s not that so much as Krieger? Well, I needed ballast, and what better to simulate bricks of cocaine than, you know, bricks of cocaine.  Krieger And when I realized it would never feel the wind on its face or taste the salty spray of the sea, I I You what? I blew it up! God damn you all to hell, I blew it up! You mean it\'s all gone? No.  No, not all of it.  Why? There, there.  Woodhouse dear, I need some more ice.  Straightaway, mum.  Oh.  And a small bowl, a mirror, a needle and thread,   and a straight razor.    Whoa! Whoa! You\'re not emasculating Krieger.  What the hell was the mirror for? So you could watch.  Eep! Oh.  The perfect ending to the perfect I almost said "evening. " More like months, though, isn\'t it? Since we started scrabbling for coins because the damn government took away our Everything.  They took everything.  And the only thing that was left, you idiots either lost, gave away, ate, or just blew up and sank.  Yeah, Krieger.  Archer? And so, starting now, in addition to the country music business, which Right? We are in the arms business.  There\'s still a little cocaine left.  Krieger? Yeah, Krieger.  And do we wanna talk about this, or You\'re welcome to.  I personally am going to bed.  It\'s been a long night.  Oh, yeah, why are you all dressed up? Well, not that it\'s any of anyone\'s business, but I had dinner with Ron.  Wait, you\'re still getting divorced, right? No.  We have decided to give it another chance, and so we will be going to marriage counseling and Wait, what? Huh?   Marriage counseling and what?   Oh, for We\'ve decided to have an open marriage.  Okay.  Great.  Oh, my God.  Well, it was either that or Oh, my God.  It\'s Ron!   Hel   Oh, no! And so Jesus.  Hope he doesn\'t call me.  Why would he call you Happy New Year 2015   New Year, New Color ; )God damn it, Ray! Are you drunk? No, dumbass! Are you? No! Although not for lack of trying.  Exactly, that\'s my whole point.  How can you drink rum with all this turbulence? Oh, my God, that\'s my whole point! Enough already! My God, are you people paid by the word? It\'s bad enough I\'m packed into this flying boxcar with you, without all this incessant bickering.  It\'s like I\'m stuck on a school bus.  With the worst driver on the planet! Why don\'t you shut up? Your own plane What was that? It is kind of like a school bus.  When have you ever been on a bus? No, from the movies.  We\'ve got the whole Breakfast Club in here.  I\'m Emilio Estevez, Cyril\'s obviously Anthony Michael Nerd, Mother, you\'re Paul Gleason, Krieger\'s the loose cannon Judd Nelson, and Lana, you\'re Er, urn Wait, seriously? Molly Ringwald.  Eh Oh, my God! What the hell are you talking about? Mother, hush.  Lana, come on, if any of you ISIS women is Molly Ringwald It\'s obviously Cherlene.    Totally.    What? Yeah.  She\'s the rich one, she\'s a redhead So what, you think I\'m Ally Sheedy? Are you all just saying random words? Ally Sheedy would\'ve been way more likely to get pregnant in high school.  Had there been a sequel.  God forbid.  Right? And as for who\'s the hot one Wait what, of us? I\'m the hot one! Eh Oh, my God!   Oh, get over yourself.    Huh?   What\'s that from?   Will you shut up? Oh, please, she knows we\'re in here.  She will if you don\'t shut up! Pam, I know you\'re in there.  No, we\'re not! But if we are, which I don\'t admit to, which Breakfast Clubber am I? Hmm, I guess the janitor everybody thinks is gross, but turns out to be cool.  Aw! I love that you take that as a compliment.  Happy New Year 2015   New Year, New Color ; ) So, can we get out of the crate now? No.  But as it seems we\'ve arrived at a pause in the idiocy, let\'s recap the plan for when we land in San Marcos.  Yeah, because I\'m curious how we tell Calderon we turned $6 million worth of cocaine into $1 million worth of weapons.  That\'s the CIA\'s problem.  Calderon doesn\'t care.  It\'s all gravy to him.  Yeah, Lana.  I was actually wondering that myself.  All that matters is that Calderon pays us for this shipment.  Then we use the profits to buy more weapons, which we sell to him to make more profits to buy more weapons, blah blah blah.  Lana, for God\'s sake, it\'s Econ 101.  Cyril, don\'t be shitty.  Yeah, Cyril.  Tower to unidentified aircraft.  You are now entering restricted San Marcos airspace.  Identify yourself.  Uh, guys? Just tell them Slater sent us.  You think that\'s a good idea? Flying into a war zone, telling them we\'re with the CIA? If Slater even was CIA.  Now, he\'s the one who teabagged you? Uh, beanbagged.  Oh, whichever.  It\'s a fairly important distinction! Sorry, can I be a nag for a second? Oh, my God, Lana! I\'ve had only, like, eight drinks.  Okay, not that, but wait, really? Yeah, I\'ve totally cut back.  And not that it\'s any of your beeswax, but I\'ve also cut back on, you know On what? Sterling, with you that could almost literally be anything.  Anonymous sex! If you must know! Ew! Beechcraft, please identify.  Guys.  Really? I\'ve totally, relatively cleaned up my act.  So maybe keep that in mind when you\'re choosing godparents? I will, Archer.  I really will.  Beechcraft, identify.  Guys! God damn it! Tell him Slater sent us! Wait, wait, wait Tower, this is Beechcraft.  Ray! Uh, Slater sent us.  Beechcraft, you are cleared for landing.  Thank you for hearing my concerns.  Jesus, will you relax? What\'s the worst that could happen? Get on the ground! Get on the ground! Hands up! Get on the ground! Don\'t shoot! Hands up!

Seor Presidente, it is such an honor to meet you.  I\'m Malory Archer.  WOW! Well, thank you.  Anyhoo Hello? So, the stories are true! What stories? I Not What\'s Damn it, man, I was sleepwalking!

Wait a minute, you said eight drinks.  I lied.  I mean, yes, eight.  Holy dickballs! I mean, I mean, I mean, just holy Dickballs, yes, Pam, I got it.  Are you sure? The room is okay? Yeah, it\'s fine, whatever.  I cannot believe it is actually you! Here! In my palace! I mean Yeah it\'s blowin\' your mind, huh? Boom! Can I please bring you anything, a freshly squeezed juice, a cocktail, a sandwich of your own choosing Don\'t you, like, have a war to go to? It\'s in the mountains, far, far away.  Where we will crush the communist rebel dogs! Especially now that we are once again receiving weapons.  Yoo hoo! And about that, I was hoping that you and I could discuss our terms? I But Cherlene ls exhausted.  As is my drink.  Why do we always have to share a room? The sinister gay cabal, Cyril.  You have fallen victim to the sinister gay cabal.  Okay.  You know I don\'t know why we always get stuck together.  But I kinda don\'t mind it.  Actually, I don\'t either, now that I Queer! Apache helicopters! We should sell those! Cause I\'m a ropper!

Your mother and I are drinking wine that belonged to Benjamin Franklin.  We are? And discussing a shipment of four American tanks.  Oh, tanks! Thanks.  Tanks? We do tanks! We can do anything, as long as you\'re willing to pay.  Me pay? Good, then it\'s settled.  If you say so, Mother.  No, no, I\'m sorry.  I thought this is why the CIA was buying my cocaine.  To sell to the American black people, to make the money to buy the weapons to give to me to fight the comunistas.  Exactly.  Wait, what? Why wouldn\'t they just Sterling, shut up and let me handle this, because the problem, Gustavo Oh I\'m sorry.  May I call you Gustavo? No.  The problem, Seor Presidente The problem, you see, the problem is ls the White House has lost faith in your ability to win this war! Ooh.  And so, if you want any more weapons, you\'ll have to pay for them in cash.  Ooh.  Starting now.  No, no But I cannot afford to do this! Oh, please.  Look at you, drinking Ben Franklin\'s wine like it\'s Kool Aid, surrounded by priceless art Not this one obviously, but No, this one cost 40 millions.  What? What? Yes.  It is an Ivan Blitko.  So we have, in this area, these very geometric shapes, and these very bold colors here, and then the thick black lines are coming here, always drawing the eye to here, and then, over everything, just white.  Just layer after layer after layer of pure white.  Until you can see nothing of the painting below.  Not even with an infrared camera.  So, what\'s the point? The point? What is the point of a beautiful woman? And speaking of! Hello, darling.  My Wife! Sterling! Where are your manners? Probably in my room, so I should go there right now and find them.

May I call you No.  Uh, darling, how was your afternoon? Exhausting.  Hmm.  So hot and sweaty.  Hmm.  To be honest, I\'m really quite sore.  Mmm hmm.  You see? This is why I disapprove.  Juliana sometimes goes among the servants, pretending to be a maid or working in the laundry, even one time helping to carry some rocks? Oh, how Inspiring, really.  Hmm.  I was just showing them the Blitko.  Do you like what you see, Mr.  Archer? You know, so much that I\'m gonna go write about it in my art journal! She is going to bring us some tanks, so that we may crush the rebel dogs.  Did they tell you what is for dinner? Clones? Yes, clones! My God, it was like looking in several mirrors! Oh man, oh man, oh man, oh man Archer! What? Ow! Hang on.  Got a stitch.  Damn it, I don\'t have time for Wait, Pam, did you find an ice machine? Uh uh.  Oh Hang on.  God damn it.  Clones! What?

Okay not that, but A, a palace this big definitely has an ice machine.  Maybe not in the hall, but it\'s not like they make ice with trays.  B B is "Hey, shut up," because I wanna talk to you about that thing where you said you\'re cleaning up your act.  Which I\'m actually pretty serious about, by the way, but right now, I wanna talk about this other thing where I just banged Calderon\'s wife.  Lana.  Uh, hang on.  Okay.  Why would you do that? I I\'m sorry, do you mean where? No, Archer, I mean why! What happened to "no more anonymous sex"? It wasn\'t anonymous, Lana! I thought she was the maid! Why would you think that? I\'m sorry, do you mean why? Yes! Why? Uniform, towels, the usual maid stuff! The Whoa, whoa, whoa.  Back up.  What is your definition of anonymous sex? I don\'t know, bird masks! Or a woman you literally bump into on the train! Or the ferry! Or in a porta john at the Preakness that time.  But not somebody who works directly for a president, I can tell you that.  I mean, we\'re talking major security clearance, so you gotta assume there\'s a pretty thorough vetting process for that You know You done? Hang on.  Yes.  Okay.  So, here\'s my advice.  Do with it as you will.  Oh! Hey, are you going to this dinner? Or did you already eat? Crayons.  Should we not just start? Not until the guest of honor arrives.  Whoo hoo! Yes, yes, yes.

Speaking of killing people Oh, my God.  Okay, first of all, he Actually, yeah, Pam, let\'s hear some Bee Gees.  Ah! Ah! Ah! Stayin\' alive.  Holy shit! That works.  Yeah, so does Kevlar.

Because every time, you shoot me! Whoa, whoa, whoa.  Not every time.  Three out of four, tops.  You big baby.  Also speaking of Here it comes.  No, actually, here it goes.  I\'m leaving.  Ray, airport, let\'s go.  Have you lost your mind? Seriously, lam not your servant.  Ow! God damn it! Not that! Ow! Lana, in case you haven\'t noticed, this place is crawling with rebels.  And not the good kind you get drunk with at Myrtle Beach and cruise the strip in the bed of their monster truck with a big rebel flag on it, flinging empty longnecks at people.  Yeah.  Those aren\'t actually the good kind either.  Now who\'s racist? Those guys, Pam, those exact same guys you just described.  Oh.  Well, now I feel like an asshole.  When do you not? Almost always.  I really like me.  Baffling.  As is leaving before Calderon pays us for that shipment of weapons, so When was that supposed to happen? After a lovely dinner with him and his freshly banged first lady? His What are you talking about? I\'m talking about Archer, who just Oops.  Give me that! Mother, be careful, that crazy thing\'s got a mind of its own.  And it\'s not the only thing.  Why can\'t you keep it in your pants? Oh, Mother.  It\'s not funny, I actually use mine.  Yes, always.  What happened to no more anonymous sex? We had already met.  Not the first time! The first time, I thought she was the maid.  Why would you have sex with a maid? That doesn\'t merit a response, Mother.  And the second time, she blackmailed me.  How did she blackmail you? By threatening to tell Calderon about the first time.  That\'s the honeypot.  How could you fall for that? It\'s Espionage 101.  I know, it\'s pretty ironic.  But also, I always fall for it.  And now, what\'s to stop her from telling him about the second time? Mmm.  Nothing, she\'s crazy.  Ow! Ow! Lana, quit it! Ow! Ow! God damn it! Asshole.  We\'re dead! You\'ve killed us! Me? I didn\'t have a follow up.  To that.  All right, Lana, you win.  Yay! Win what? We\'re leaving right now.  Ray.  Already packing mentally.  Damn it, man, forget your kimonos! Oh, like I brought a huge stack.  Five\'s a pretty big stack.  Cyril, shut up and go find a vehicle.  Ray, find Cherlene.  No matter what happens, we can\'t leave without her.  She said, suddenly oddly maternal.  Right? She has to endorse the royalty checks.  And the penny drops.  You shut up and the rest of you shut up and grab anything valuable.  Ooh! Like that ridiculous white painting.  Wait, what about Krieger? Oh Who cares about Krieger? Plus, I bet the vampires got him.  Oh.  So now will you join us, brother? Yes.  Clone bone! My God, I have so many questions.  Are you clones of me? Am I a clone of you? Did you all grow up together, in an actual house with an actual mom and dad? And was I ever there? No.  To all of it.  You sure? Because I have this very clear memory of me as a child and it\'s snowing, and there\'s a creepy old man trying to take me away, and then I knock him down with a sled.  That\'s Citizen Kane.  Oh.  Wait, no, not a sled.  A pneumatic bolt gun.  Now that does sound vaguely familiar.  Right? Wait, no, I remember blood on snow.  Right? No.  That was something else.  He was never with us as a child.  Well, the important thing is that you\'re with us now.  Especially since your friends "Friends. " Please.  Can you believe those jerks? After all these years? Kicking me to the curb like A child.  A frog.  Frog child.  No! Is that what I think it is? No.  Well, let me finish, because I think it\'s some kind of unholy adolescent human amphibian hybrid creature.  Oh.  Then yes.  I\'m home.  I\'m finally home.  Just in time for our moment of triumph.  Well, if there\'s one thing I love, it\'s triumph.  What is it? All will be revealed in time.  And if there\'s one thing I love more than triumph, it\'s annoying vagueness.  Cyril, shut up and find a vehicle.  I\'m a hateful shrew.  And this is my idiot son, Archer.  He\'s going to screw the dictator\'s wife and then shoot you in the chest.  Makes me so mad.  One of these days, I swear to Jesus H.  Chrysler! Well, one thing\'s for sure.  If I had to do it over, I\'d be a dictator.  What? My God, come on, how can you even say that? Because that\'s what you are! Cherlene, I\'m not a dictator.  I\'m a president, like your Jorge Washington.  Jorge Washington, which apparently I\'ve been mispronouncing wrong this whole time, wasn\'t president for life! He could have been if he wanted.  The 22nd amendment to your constitution imposed the presidential term limits.  But it wasn\'t passed by your congress until 1947, and not ratified by the requisite number of American states until 1951.  So Who are you, Dave Frishberg? I don\'t know who that is.  Of course you don\'t.  Because you don\'t live in a free country where the world\'s largest manufacturers of sugary cereals are allowed to sponsor interstitial animated programming unapologetically targeted at children! No.  I live in a very poor country.  No, look, I know.  But go outside the palace walls and trust me, Cherlene, listen, it is crazy poor.  Yeah, that was my whole And so, I wanted to distribute your records among, I hate to say this, but our filthy peasants, so as to brighten their lives with your music.  Oh.  Well, now I feel like a Wait, do they even have record players? Well, no, obviously not, but So how would they even use records? As plates? What in the name of all that is stupid do you think you\'re doing? You tell me, crazy pregnant hormone lady.  What\'s it look like I\'m doing? But before you answer, please don\'t say "literally being emasculated," because I looked that up and Ick.  Hold it up.  Lana, come on.  You and Mother smashed my balls pretty good.  Kudos, they\'re swollen.  But I don\'t need a cutman.  The painting, you idiot.  Oh.  Thought you meant my genitals.  But look, I know you\'re jealous I had sex with Juliana, almost twice.  But don\'t slash the painting, it\'s Priceless.  But worthless if you damage it.  But even though it\'s very delicate, it can withstand a surprising amount of shit.  Wait, is this an extremely ill phrased analogy about my penis? Yes, Archer, it is, because everything, everywhere, everywhen is about the paragon of adequacy that is your dick.  "Adequacy" as in "mindblowingness"? Or "adequacy" as in "Hey, stupid, "you just destroyed $40 million. " As in neither, you dummy.  This is how you steal a painting.  Did you never see The Thomas Crown Affair? No, not a huge Steve McQueen fan.  Oh, my God, are you Archer, you used to moan about him in your sleep.  No, I didn\'t.  Come on, you can do this, just pick a stupid car.  But the perfect car, so that for once in her life, Ms.  Archer can\'t bitch.  And we\'ll be driving through a war zone, so it needs to be fast.  Although I guess reliability is more important than speed.  Well, up to a point.  Although, bulletproof glass wouldn\'t be bad Damn it, Figgis! You\'re overthinking this! Oh! Now that is a vehicle.  Let\'s see Ms.  Archer bitch about that.  You idiot! I gave you one simple job and I looked in her room! And? And she wasn\'t in it.  Pam, if you want to scuff them that badly, just throw them down the What? Were you not gonna say stairs? Uh, hang on, hang on.  Wait, wait.  Damn it.  I have something for this, it\'s, um. .   Uh I assume it was about that ad with the suitcase and the gorilla.  Ouch.  Which, turns out, was actually a man in a gorilla costume.  Making the comparison even more accurate.  Ow! Seriously.  Let go of me! There, I found her.  Cherlene, please! No, I said! But, Cherlene, listen, I love you.  I will divorce my wife.  You what? Oh, don\'t act so surprised, Juliana.  It\'s not like we\'re in love anymore.  Anymore? We were never in love! And suddenly, I don\'t feel so bad.  You did before? Oh, my God, you have no idea, it\'s this ache in the pit of your stomach.  Are you talking about your balls? Yeah, but it\'s wearing off now.  And I will tell you the same thing I told your father.  I will never give you a divorce! Tell that to the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court.  Oh, wait, you just did.  Wait, you can\'t be both.  Your William Howard Taft was.  Not at the same time! He absolutely was.  Is that true? I wanna say church and state? When we get home, first thing, we are binge watching Schoolhouse Rock! You can binge watch it in hell! Well, if anything, that\'s heaven.  And you can die knowing that the last man inside of me was Archer.  What? Oh, yeah, so about that Well, I hope it was worth dying for.  Honestly? Right? Well, no, but the first time Honestly? No, the first time.  Goodbye, Mr.  Archer.  Give my regards to William Howard Taft.  No.  No! No! No! Pam? Pam.  Pam, seriously.  Archer? Lana, shut up.  Pam!   Archer, I think she\'s   I think she\'s. .   Dead.  And now you, Mr.  Archer, can join her in Out law country! I\'m gonna go Jerry Lee on your ass! Urn Do you wanna Yes.  Wait, were you gonna say watch? I was gonna say help, but Shut up, did she say she used to be married to Calderon\'s father? Yeah, that\'s some messed up shit.  Pam! How are you not dead? \'Cause I\'m not a pussy? And also probably \'cause of this.  Is that Cyril\'s? Yep.  Urn You know they\'re not reusable, right? Once the fibers get damaged, that\'s basically just a sweater vest.  Oh, good.  \'Cause for a second there, I thought I actually was a pussy.  Hurts, huh? Hey, so Yeah.  Now do you wanna help? Oh, okay, Mother, give me my gun.  I don\'t have it, I threw it away.  You what? Why would you throw away a perfectly good gun? Because it touched your junk.  How dirty do you think my junk is? As dirty as if it were made of dirt and then got dropped in some different dirt.  And then Pig Pen came along and kicked it around with his dirty shoes.  Fair enough.  Nobody move! Except you, Juliana.  Let go of Cherlene and throw down the gun.  Now then.  Ow! Ow! Ow! Stop it! Stop it! Ow! No! Ow! Ow! Ow! Oh! Now then! Cherlene.  Stop this at once.  As your husband, I command you.  My what? Sorry, hang on.  Juliana, I divorce you, but also, I wish you the best of luck in the years ahead, which you will spend in prison.  Cherlene, I now pronounce us husband and wife.  Weddings always get me.  Plus cocaine.  No, we are so not married! Are you Wait, which is it? Literally.  Are you literally insane? No, but my word is literally law.  One of the perks of being a dictator.  You said you weren\'t a dictator! I lied, okay? But hopefully, our marriage is strong enough that together and over time, we can work through it.  Well, at least he admits he was wrong.  Yeah, \'cause that makes it all better.  When did you get so cynical?   The rest of you are under arrest!   What? Except those of you who are to be executed.  Wait, what? Hey, guys? Urn In which case I would not put a lot of money in my prison canteen account.  lam looking your way, Mr.  Archer.  Wait.  No! Well, then good luck getting any more weapons, you cut rate Castro! Ha! I don\'t need them.  As we speak, my scientists are working on a secret weapon.  And soon, I will water our coca fields with the rebels\' blood! Gross! I can\'t believe I married you.  Presidente! Good, yes.  I\'m glad you are here.  I\'ve been bluffing the whole time.  Totally out of bullets.  See that? My bad, guys.  That\'s on me.  Anyway.  Okay now, Comandante, arrest these people.  But, Presidente, the rebels.  They have smashed our counterattack.  They are headed for the palace.  Hurry, we must get you out of here.  Wait, and me.  I\'m the first lady! Please, hurry, we have to go before Dont just stand there, you cowards.  Do something! Oh.  Really? That\'s obviously not what Don\'t shoot! Don\'t shoot! We surrender! Uh, what\'s that? Yeah.  I couldn\'t hear you over the sound of this gigantic friggin tank.  You idiot, that\'s the vehicle you found? I meant a limousine or Jesus God, woman, nothing is ever good enough for you! Right? Please.  Sir.  Accept our surrender.  No, not to him.  He\'s not the rebels.  Kind of a moot point though, isn\'t it? What, with the tank and all.  Yeah.  So I hereby I accept your surrender.  Dibs.  I\'m in charge.  Cyril, get out of the Sorry, I still couldn\'t hear you.  Yeah, Cyril, you are sorry, because you still look like an idiot.  You look like, uh Oh, my God.  Hang on, wait, wait.  I actually have something for this.  Mi Mike Ducockless! Oh, boy.  Happy New Year 2015   New Year, New Color ; )Archer.  Lana? Lana! Whoa! Jesus Christ, chill out, Miggs! I\'m sorry, it\'s just been so long.  Okay, it\'s been Oh, my God, you\'re pregnant again? What? How long have I been down here, left to rot in this godforsaken hole? Like, three weeks.  Hmm.  Seems so much longer than that.  So please tell me that\'s an entire canard a la presse with a file in it.  Half a chicken, no file, just that weird quasi cornbread they have here.  Ugh! Why do you even bother? That\'s weird, I was asking myself the same thing on the way down here.  And then brought crappy food anyway? And then left? No, no, wait.  Come on, Lana.  I\'m sorry.  But I\'m starting to lose it down here, you gotta make him let me go.  Make him how? Well, I hate to even ask, but Blow him? Your words.  And then what, Archer, you want me to blow the whole army? How is there still an army? How have the rebels not wiped them out already? Because, turns out, he\'s actually very good at commanding an army.  And as 3rd and 4th Battalion withdraw, here comes 1st Armored, and now the rebels are outflanked.  Sir, it\'s brilliant.  Hmm.  A classic pincer movement.  Just like Hannibal at the Battle of Cannae.  And also Keith in my Warhammer guild.  So get used to that weird cornbread, \'cause you might be down here Lana, I need a woman\'s touch.  I\'m sorry, Lana.  I said a woman, not a stevedore who lost his hand in a stevedoring accident and then got a hand transplant from an actual bear.  So did you wanna just do it right through the bars, or I mean, we do.  And sometimes, they do.  Hello.  So in three weeks, you go from you\'re going to execute Archer to now you guys are swinger pals? Well, I wouldn\'t say "pals. " Oh, wow.  Not what you said yesterday.  Oh, come on, that was the pruno talking.  Well, I hate to break up this delightful mnage, but Presidente Cyril wants her back upstairs.  Wait, what? What? Why? Guess.  Ah! Mmm.  Ow! Oh, wait, wait, wait.  What? What? Archer, do you want me to move over one? Eh Happy New Year 2015   New Year, New Color ; ) Ah, Madam First Lady.  So good of you to join me.  It\'s not as if I had a choice.  Well Nor am I still the first lady.  Well, maybe not technically, since your husband divorced you and then was immediately deposed, by me.  But the situation is, as they say, fluid.  Ugh! I brought her, can I go now? Yes, for the love of God, get out.  I meant home.  What are you, nuts? Cap\'n Crunch here just took all the coca fields back from the rebels.  We\'re sitting on an endless supply.  Of what? Coca leaf smoothies? Oh, my God, that\'s a coca leaf smoothie.  And they\'re gross.  It basically tastes like a fart of itself.  But it\'s better than the cocaine donuts and whipped cocaine she was eating.  \'Cause that\'s just empty calories.  Well, and cocaine.  Which, if I\'m being totally honest, I maybe might have a problem with.  No.  And Lana, the rebels still control the airport.  It\'s their HQ, so unless you want to walk, you can\'t go home.  And why on earth would you want to? Why bother going back? The U. S.  government stole your livelihood, forced you to become a criminal.  And I hate to say it, but it\'s not like you have a man waiting for you.  Iyou know Whereas here, we have everything we need.  It\'s like San Marcos has been waiting thousands of years for us to arrive.  Lana, this could be our Don\'t.  Zion, yes.  There, I said it.  Wait, they got weed here, too? That\'s not what the song\'s about! Told you.  But I just this second realized why you want to stay down here.  Cyril\'s just the Vader to your Palpatine.  Is that a reference I should get, or Seriously? Well, I\'m sorry, Lana, I didn\'t go to rabbinical school.  It\'s from No, you know what? Never mind.  But, spoiler alert, Vader ends up killing Palpatine.  Hey.  But only for three days, right? And then he moves the rock and comes out of his cave stronger than ever.  Then he shuts off the tractor beam, releasing the Jews from captivity.  What? Hey.  Wait, yes, now that sounds familiar.  It cannot possibly.  Gospel of Luke? Hey.  Ray, you used to be a preacher, you wanna back me up here? I actually don\'t know, my church didn\'t really do the New Testament.  The one with Jesus Christ in it.  I mean, I take your word for it, but Hey! Will you idiots get out? I\'m trying to talk to the first lady.  Of what, this country, or country music? \'Cause I\'m first lady of both! No, you\'re not.  Outlaw country! Oh, my God, my beautiful and also multi talented wife.  You are here.  I know, right? It\'s like, finally.  As in, this is a good thing? Duh! I\'m finally gonna get the outlaw country cred I deserve.  Oh, my God, you\'ve always deserved it.  Wait, how does being in jail Paging Doctor Black! Doctor Man In Black! Johnny Cash was in Folsom Prison and San Quentin, so Yeah, to visit.  Hmm? He just played for the prisoners, dummy, he wasn\'t actually in prison.  But don\'t worry, we\'re gonna get out of here and go join the rebels.  Yes.  Then you and I, my beautiful wife, will live a simple life in the hills, scratching shit food like yams out of the ground with a yam scratcher.  Okay A, start counting backwards from a million years, and when you get to zero, that still won\'t happen.  Aw.  And B, how How do we get out of here? Well, we\'re still fine tuning it, but We have no plan whatsoever.  Okay good, because I didn\'t wanna step on anybody\'s toes, but Byoink! What? Where did you get that? Let\'s just say I honestly don\'t know.  Fair enough.  Cyril says the rebel headquarters are Wait, is it "are" or is it "is"? It\'s where, idiot! The airport! Jesus! And you, sir, will keep a civil tongue in your head when you are addressing the first lady of the government in exile of La Repblica de San Marcos.  And also country music.  I facetiously beg milady\'s pardon.  Oh! Milady facetiously grants it.  Oh, goody.  Now let\'s steal a car, go join the rebels, then come back here and crush Cyril\'s stupid army.  You make it sound so easy.  Well, it\'s Cyril.  Unless he\'s got a nuclear warhead in his pants Which he totally does.  Which Guys, can we talk about this? The time for talk is kaput, Klon Bruder.  Now is the time for action.  Clone bone! And by that I mean his, you know Yeah, we Let me finish! Penis.  No, you ruined it.  And by it, I meant the moment.  Not his penis.  I Penis.  Will you shut up? I know what I\'m doing.  Yes, but don\'t do what you are doing.  Are you crazy? This car is worth one quarter of one million dollars.  Well, was.  And did you ever think maybe your fleet of priceless cars is the reason you\'re fighting off a rebellion? I\'m fighting the rebels because that is what we do.  My father fought the rebels, his father fought the rebels.  So like a family business.  That manufactures oppression.  Well, and cocaine.  In fact Stop! What? That.  If you think we have time.  ls there a tiger? Of course there is a tiger.  Where do you think you are, Tegucigalpa? And so, by the power self vested in me, I now pronounce us man and wife, and I may also kiss the bride.  Ugh! Second worst wedding ever.  Yeah, but at least nobody died.  Yet! lnappropes.  What is wrong with you? I\'m trying to make that a thing people say, like, "Damn, dawg, that\'s inappropes!" Plus, I think I\'m addicted to cocaine.  Well, but look on the bright side.  With any luck at all, it will save me the trouble of killing you myself.  Damn, dawg.  Inappropes.  They should\'ve sent a poet.  Oh, and some meat, do we have any meat? Literally tons.  No, I didn\'t mean another animal.  I meant a steak or some Typical American.  You think meat comes from the supermercado, all wrapped in a nice plastic wrap.  Yeah, you\'re describing meat.  No, no, no.  Meat is blood, and bones, and sinew.  Well, now you\'re describing not meat.  Meat is whatever the tiger says is meat, because God made him the boss and all the other animals his food.  Hang on, buddy.  And thank you, George Bore well, for that clunky analogy in defense of totalitarianism, but I\'m not feeding Shane an elephant.  Who the hell is Oh, my God, he\'s totally a Shane.  So let me bounce this off you guys.  What say we don\'t launch this giant nerve gas missile at, uh Where did you say you were launching it? Wouldn\'t you like to know.  I would, actually.  Come on, you guys are acting a little insane.  Do you know what\'s insane? Yeah, this.  All of it, everything.  The rocket, I\'m not really comfortable with the clone bone.  You\'re not doing it right.  Now move, so I can begin the launch sequence.  Over my dead Body.  Man, that was a jinx, huh? No, no, wait, wait! Hang on! As amazing as it would be, we can\'t take Shane with us.  Yeah, we can, watch.  No, no, no! No, no, no! Don\'t! Okay, okay, okay.  Carol, listen to me very closely.  Why, you gonna walk me through your organic method of vaginal hygiene? My what? You\'re a bigger pussy than Shane.  Come here, boy.  Shane! Do something! Like what? Get him! We\'re coming, brother! KRIEGER Brother! You bastard.  Brother, the launch sequence.  No! Don\'t stop! Almost there.  Oh, come on.  Shut up.  Launch sequence initiated.  No! Ha ha! It doesn\'t work with a bow Shane! Shane! Shane! Shane? Well, we should\'ve guessed that was gonna happen.  Uh We should\'ve? Well, or at least could\'ve.  I mean Yeah,  I guess a leopard can\'t change his spots.  Uh I don\'t know that much about leopards.  That was actually a proverb.  That was actually a tiger.  Minutes to launch, 180.  Huh.  That is a lot longer than I thought it would be.  Okay, when we get to rebel HQ, they might be aggressive at first They wouldn\'t if we had a damn tiger.  No.  We\'re not going back.  Unless No.  What if He had his chance!   A what?   A charivari.  Also called a shivaree.  It\'s that thing where everybody bangs pots and pans outside our room as we consummate? on No.  We\'re not doing that.  Ow! Ray, my feet are already killing me.  Sorry.  He\'s probably not used to leading.  You, on the other hand, lead away.  Mind if I Cut in? Yes! No.  Screw you guys, Hey, Krieger! What the hell is going on? Cyril\'s the new dictator.  President.  Shut up.  And he just married Crazy Tits, and I need a dance partner.  So nobody noticed that I\'ve been missing for three weeks? We figured the vampires ate you.  Wait, what? The what? They\'re not vampires, they\'re my clones.  Or I\'m their clone, or Oh, please, you and your clone nonsense, it\'s all a bunch of Holy shit! Why was I not informed of this, Krieger?   If he even is Krieger.    Huh? What? The real Krieger could be down there.  Oh, for That is just I won\'t even dignify that with a response.  Urn Uh Pam! Pam? Uh huh.  I\'ve got a concussion.  And this regular tie means nothing.  I don\'t like bow ties, so I switched.  Well, you certainly sound concussed.  He sounds like a vampire.  I say we tie him up and let the sun sort it out.  You need to hush.  Minutes to launch, 150.  What? What was that? Tell me that robot\'s not talking about launching this rocket, Krieger.  Or should we say Count Krieg Ow! Ow! Ah! Cut it out! Ow! God damn it! Ow! Thank you.  Vampire lovers.  Yeah, so, here\'s the thing.  This is it, rebel headquarters.  Now remember, let me do the talking.  Got it.  I\'m serious.  I got it.  Look at me.  I got it! Jesus! Okay.  Then here we go.  Ow! God damn it! You said you\'d let me do the Aw So You\'re saying this gigantic rocket is not only full of deadly nerve gas, but also aimed God knows where? Well, that statement presupposes the existence of God, but Krieger, I am about two seconds away from telling Pam to get a wooden stake.  Yay! I\'m not a vampire! Doesn\'t matter to the stake.  Then, yes.  It\'s full of nerve gas, and I don\'t know where it\'s aimed.  What? What\'s the range on this thing? I don\'t know, How far away is the Upper East Side? I don\'t know, 1,980 something miles? Okay, this is a presidential order from the president.  Shut it down.  I can\'t.  Can\'t? Or won\'t? Can\'t! Oh.  I didn\'t hear you.  Ray, can you override the launch sequence? Um Launch sequence accelerated.  No.  Minutes to launch, 90.  Cyril.  Uh It\'s actually Seor Presidente, but Shh! Hush.  Now I know you\'ve had a fun time as dictator, and we all enjoyed this little break from him.  But Cyril.  And if you tell him I said this, I\'ll break your friggin\' arms, it\'s Ugh Archer time.  Wha All right.  Krieger, I assume the whatever Doppelkriegers.  I assume they had a lab.  So take Ray and see if you can find some info on how to shut this damn thing down.  We\'ll go get Archer.  Ooh, and Cherlene! Ooh.  And no.  Because she isn\'t here.  Argh! Damn it, Archer! Damn you! He can\'t even let me pretend to be magnanimous while inwardly gloating.  Oh, shut up.  What does the note say? "Hey Cyril! You can suck it, because we have gone to join the rebels.  "Yes.  At the airport.  No, not the airport.  Somewhere else. " So, airport? But the note says not Well, I guess that settles that.  It\'s not like we can just waltz into enemy territory and Well, I certainly can\'t.  Can\'t, or Both, either, all.  They\'d shoot me on sight, Lana.  And if you want Archer so damn bad, you can go get him your Huh.  I didn\'t think she\'d actually do it.  Then you\'re an idiot.  Oh, I\'m the idiot? Yes.  Ugh.  What the Holly? Archer? Rando? Slater? Who the hell is Rando? Him.  That\'s Sterling Archer.  And I am Cherlene.  The Queen of Outlaw Country.  What the hell are you doing here? I could ask you the same question.  lam asking you the same question.  We came to join the rebels.  What? What\'s the FBI doing in San Marcos? With a cocaine smuggler.  I\'m not FBI, and he\'s not a Well, technically I am, but We\'re both CIA.  What? C I A.  And we\'re also the rebels.  And you are in a mundo of caca.  Okay! Listen, stop! Listen to me! Lana? Holly? What\'s the FBI doing These dickheads aren\'t FBI, Lana, they\'re CIA! And also the rebels.  Huh.  Thought that would get more of a reaction.  Yeah, no, that is, um, news.  Uh But my water just broke.  So Happy New Year 2015   New Year, New Color ; )What do you mean your water broke? What do you mean what do I mean, I mean that! I\'m going into labor! Wait, what? I\'m having a baby? Gross! But it\'s early, is that early? Like 10 days, but But that\'s bad, is that bad? Archer, none of this is ideal!   Hey!   What! What the hell are you people doing in San Marcos in the first place? Selling weapons to Calderon! That we got from him! What? What.  What "what," you didn\'t think that was something I\'d like to know about? I\'m positive we talked about this.  No, we didn\'t! When? When did we talk about this? Wait a minute, if the CIA is backing the rebels against Calder Lana! Was that a contraction? Yep.  God.  I hope so.  Yep.  Time! Start a clock, assholes! Okay Mark! Twain! No, that\'s barges! Shut up, but, hey, speaking of time What\'s your Bishop score? How should I Wait, how do you even know what a Bishop score is? I got certified as a doula.  Which, turns out, is not that hard.  Shut up, does the CIA know Calderon has a nerve gas missile at the palace? What the We didn\'t give him gas! Cool! Well he\'s got it, and we can\'t override the launch sequence, so Get that idiot, Calderon, on the phone! Oh, did I mention a tiger ate him? Well not ate, ate Well, no, but by now Jesus God.  Okay, Slater, I know it\'s a little sooner than we wanted, but Operation Dropkick, roger that.  What\'s Operation Dropkick? Well, the endgame has always been for us to invade San Marcos, so Hey, Donna, we got a carrier group in the Gulf, right? Wait, if you were going to invade San Marcos then why have you been selling weapons to Calderon? So he could fight the rebels.  Which is you.  Well, technically, they\'re mercenaries from Honduras and Guatemala, but, yes.  Okay, so am I just stupid, or Duh.  Pregnant.  Yeah, airstrike, naval bombardment, amphibious landing, whole megillah.  Calderon needed weapons to fight the rebels, but he didn\'t have money to buy weapons, he only had cocaine, but Iran was like "No way, cash only," so Iran? Ooh, sorry! Iraq.  Wait, no, Iran.  Doesn\'t matter who.  Anyway, to buy the weapons, we needed to Monetize the cocaine.  on, my God Join the club.  We\'ve been trying to monetize cocaine for like I mean You even came to the house, where we We\'ve been selling cocaine for the CIA so they could buy arms from Iran? Did we at least free some hostages? No, this was about our annual budget.  What? If we don\'t spend it this year We can\'t get an increase next year.  You son of a Oh, come on, Archer, drop the act! He was in on it from day one.  What? What? Lana! Happy New Year 2015   New Year, New Color ; ) You lying son of a bitch! Lana You knew about this the entire time? Hey, do you mind? I\'m trying to call in an airstrike here.  Ooh, hey, what\'s our ride situation? Hang on.  Thanks, doll.  Airstrike on the palace is a go, and I suggest we take Calderon\'s jet.  Good, yeah, we need plenty of room.  Until we dump them at a black site.  C\'mon, even if you people hadn\'t lost 50 million bucks\' worth of our cocaine, you know way too much.  Uh, I don\'t know anything! I believe that to be literally true.  Whoa! Whoa! Okay! Come on! We give up, don\'t shoot! Now, then.  Let\'s get this baby outta me.  Gross! Will you sh   Time?   Nine minutes! What? This is exciting.  Right? Minutes to launch, 60.  Yeah, Krieger, I guess trying to defuse a warhead tipped with deadly nerve gas is technically exciting.  Yeah, right? What is wrong with you? Nothin\', Roy.  Or Ray.  Eh.    Doesn\'t matter who.    Krieger!   Where are we on the missile?   Uh Kinda just like On it.  Oh! Do you mean where are we in the process of disarming it? Ooh! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Cut it out! Ow! Okay.  What happened? Did it explode? Uh, no, I think we would\'ve heard it .

You did good, kiddo.  Mmm.  Yeah Oh.  And, uh I quit.  What? Why? Because you lying to me I can handle.  I\'m used to that, but Not Archer.  Oh, for He didn\'t know that I made a deal to sell cocaine for the CIA.  Pff.  Whatever.  Lana Kane.  You have known me for a long, long time.  When have I ever been honest with Sterling? Huh.  Exactly.  Now, if you two will excuse me, I need to go threaten and/or bribe some federal agents.  Well at least put a seatbelt on it! See? What\'d I tell you! I thought it was just for takeoff and landing! Jesus Christ So, how\'s she doing? She\'s fine.  I told her you didn\'t know anything about the CIA deal.  Well, thanks for telling the truth, Mother, sure that was hard for you.  You keep it up, mister, and I\'ll walk right back in there and tell her the whole thing was your idea! Did you guys hear that? No.  Dicks.  All right, Holly, this is my offer and it is non negotiable You think she\'s buyin\' more coke? Ugh! You and your stupid, stupid cocaine! Can\'t you give her a brain chip? A what? A brain chip? Like you gave Cherlene so she could become a country singer? No, that wasn\'t a brain chip.  It was just the sticker off the backpack of a little LEGO spaceman.  What? A LEGO sticker? Woah.  So my whole life all I ever had to do was believe in myself? And inject a sticker into my brain? Are you out of your mind? Are you? Showing up at the mansion, pretending to search for the cocaine? While planting the seed in your idiot son\'s brain about selling it overseas.  Which I could have handled if the CIA had kept its fat nose out! And yet here we are, with a $50 million hole in our account! There\'s 40 of it.  An original Ivan Blitko we stole from Calderon.  What am I supposed to do with that? Gosh, I don\'t know, what am I supposed to do with a canister of nerve gas? No, uh uh, that is now CIA property.  Ooh, and won\'t that be a feather in your cap.  They might even make you director.  Hmm.  Or at least deputy ops Which, and I\'m just spitballing here, would mean you could outsource a good deal of business to a private firm.  Like ISIS.  So, you lose us $50 million and you wanna get on the CIA payroll? Right after you renovate my offices.  Ha! You really are out of your mind! Or right after I take this deal to your partner in the cockpit So what\'s your deal? What\'s my deal? Never mind.  because you suddenly decided to take up skydiving.  I think we may have a deal here.  Knock knock? Who\'s there? Shit, I had something for this.  Come see the baby, stupid.  Wow.  Yeah.  Wow.  Yeah.  I had black guy.  Yeah So, about that I don\'t think it\'s racist, it\'s just Archer, shut up.  You shut up.  Archer.  Okay, so, remember when you had cancer? Um, uh, vaguely.  Okay.  Well, we all thought you were gonna die, and one night you got really drunk and we almost had sex, and right before you passed out you told me Malory had convinced you to freeze a bunch of your sperm at Dr.  Feldman\'s office and I was, like, "Huh.  Weird," and then you didn\'t die and then a few years went by, and I starting thinking about having a baby but I was single, and all the other stuff aside, physically you\'re an amazing human being, and all the other, other stuff aside I do actually love you And so here\'s this viable sample just sitting there at Dr.  Feldman\'s whose security system is a joke, by the way, and so, I guess it maybe wasn\'t the most ethical thing I\'ve ever done in my entire life, but Archer? Archer.  Archer! What\'s that? Wait, wait.  Huh? What? You okay? Yeah, sorry, for a second I thought I was just now coming out of a coma from when I drowned saving your life eight months ago.  Lana? Am I just now coming out of a coma from when I drowned saving your life eight months ago? No.  Lana? Am I just now coming out of a coma from when I drowned saving your life eight months ago? No.  Then what are you Baby, what is she saying? Baby? Baby.  Baby! Sterling Archer, I\'d like you to meet your daughter Abbiejean.  Happy New Year 2015   New Year, New Color ; )Ow.  Khao lard gaeng.  Sawat Dee? Well, since I can only assume this is one of your idiot voicemails, I   Mother?! Well, I\'m not falling for it again.  Oh, for   mother, it\'s me, Sterling.  Then, what is the square root of nine? Uh negative nine? Sterling? Ha! Elaborate   God damn it! I\'m kidding, it\'s three, and also me.  Ass.  Now, how\'d the hell you find me? I didn\'t, the CIA did.  Oh, and how are your new overlords? Oh for the   they\'re not   look, think of it as more of a merger.  Ha! Organizations change.  They evolve.  They grow.  Unlike some people I know.  Hey, you know what? To wit, once again you\'re off on one of your usual self pitying benders.  It\'s not a usual one, mother.  In case you forget, I was forced into becoming a parent against my will.  Join the club.  But for God\'s sake, six weeks is long enough.  Really? It\'s been six weeks? Yes, so sober up and get a bunch of penicillin shots, because   Is that him? Is that Lana? Let me talk to him.  Let me talk to her.  So, why\'d you run away when you were so excited about being a father when A. J.  was born? Did reality set it? I   wait, was that rhetorical? Because the next time you use somebody\'s sperm to impregnate yourself, then maybe that decision should include that other somebody.  Who? That other somebody who runs away at the thought of responsibility and as we speak is up to his eyeballs in cobra whisky and ladyboy hookers? Oh, that is   you don\'t know me.  Ha! I believe there was some mention of the Central Intelligence Agency? They\'ve given us our first freelance mission, and if you screw it up, there won\'t be a second one, so listen up.  I\'m listening.  Two days ago, an American spy plane went down in the jungles of Borneo about 500 miles from you.  The pilot ejected, but without the onboard computer.  You\'re to secure it, then destroy the aircraft.  You should be receiving a mission dossier well, now.  Wow.  Read it on the way to the airport, and hurry.  All the equipment you\'ll need is on an air America cargo plane that is waiting for you as we speak.  Uh, mother, it sounded like you said, "cargo plane," when obviously you meant, "first class luxury commercial airliner. " Sterling, a commercial airline won\'t let you parachute into the jungle in the middle of a communist insurgency   A what? at night.  Now, don\'t screw this up! "Screw it up. " Yeah, like she\'s one to talk.  Look how I turned out.  Hey, freaky bigtime! You owe us a hundred thousand bhat! Oh, right, yeah, no problem.  Oh, and I\'ve got an extra twenty thousand if you\'re genetic females.  Super.  God, okay, final offer, ten thousand baht, some of which has blood on it.  For the millionth and last time, we do not have mini bottles! Well, then this isn\'t a real airline.  No, it\'s not.  It\'s a CIA front! Still, though.  Why don\'t you go read the damn dossier? Read about the communist insurgency.  I don\'t do dossiers.  Besides, I\'m not a CIA schoolgirl.  This is a cakewalk for a real spy.  I punch the coordinates in the GPS, get the computer, blow up the plane with C 4, and, uh So then do you guys pick me up, or? Read the dossier.  No.  Suit yourself.  Go, go, go, go, go! Wha   Assho   Woohoo! Halo! But mini bottles? That\'s not a bad   I\'m sorry, Hank.  I forget you were working the program.  Inappropes.  Oh, my God, oh, my God, oh my God! Are you guys so frickin\' excited? I would be, if you quit jumping around.  Seriously, honey, come on.  Baby on board.  And if you two dopes didn\'t screw up this $10 million renovation   Which, again, curious as to why you put Pam and Cheryl in charge.  Because I had a very specific vision, and it wasn\'t "Japanese whorehouse. " Well, Ms.  Archer, I think you\'ll find we were very true to your vision.  Oh, I\'ve dreamed of this day.  I know.  It\'s I mean I don\'t know what to say.  Can I even wear shoes in here? Oh, this is nothing.  Wait till you see Oh, my God! I I think I could use a drink.  Oh, shut up.  Hey.  Wha   Psych! No, bring it back.  It\'s exactly like it was! We redid everything exactly like it was before Jesus, God, I\'m having a stroke.  No, the other one was just a hologram.  What the  ? What, what? What just happened? Oh, man! The look on your dumb face.  No, it\'s a stroke.  I smell toast.  Oh, that\'s probably just Milton.  Okay, it\'s the one new thing.  It makes   lemme finish! toast.  You ruined it.  Agh, son of a   God, is one last non malarial hurrah before I go home too much to ask? Agh, thanks jungle.  Eat a buffet of dicks.  Okay, the plane should be just about a half click down this trail, and   Stop! Stop! Jesus, Kato, will you stop? I mean, is this a mugging, or? You are American.  Hey, English, good.  Yes, I\'m American.  Then we are at war! We we as in who, exactly? America, and the Empire of Japan.  The   wait a minute, do you mean, like, cool Honda scrambler Japan, or   super uncool Pearl Harbor Japan? What? How long have you been on this island? Since the tenth of May Oh, boy.  Uh, well, Kato   Sato! First lieutenant Sato Kentaro.  Well Ken, I\'ve got some bad news.  Oh, and also some worse news.  Liar.  Why would I lie about the war being over? Since 1945, I might add.  To trick me into surrendering! Um I do not surrender, nor consent to be your prisoner, so just kill me.  What? No.  Ken, will you relax or is your entire generation physically incapable of doing that? How can I relax while we are at war? We\'re not! Here, shut up, look.  Here\'s you guys signing the surrender on the USS Missouri.  Here\'s all the VJ day parades in America.  Here\'s  The Bad News Bears Go to Japan.  That\'s Lupus and Tanner.  Oh, and here\'s a link to an episode of  The Six Million Man about this exact thing we\'re doing right now.  The six million who? Oh, God, you\'ve got so much to catch up on.  Okay, so there\'s this guy, Steve Austin, and he was an astronaut, but   damn, wait.  Okay.  So, an astronaut   What is this thing? This device? It\'s a telephone, kinda, that talks to outer space, and also   shit! What? I\'m supposed to go find a computer.  Here? There are no building in the jungle big enough to hold a computer! No, they\'re really small, now.  I think you guys actually did that.  Anyway, I need to go get one out of a plane that crashed near here, so Yes, I know where this airplane is.  Duh.  Me, too.  So, if I just kinda leave, are you gonna be cool, or try to sneak up on me and slit my throat? Well, I hope you\'re happy because I feel like a total dick.  And also kinda racist.  And I resent you making me feel like that, so I\'m not a racist.  I just wanted it to be all white.  Jeezy Petes, this drawer squeaks exactly like the old one did! And is this Is this Brett\'s blood? Ugh, no, just the same type.  We had to fudge it a little on the stains, some of which actually were fudge.  And some of which merely resembled it.  But why would you do this? Okay, it should be right up here, and if you try any funny stuff   Please, be more quiet.  Many enemy soldiers patrol the jungle.  Guerillas, I think, Chinese and Malays.  Oh, that must be the insurgency they were talking about, the communists.  They are communists? So, America\'s allies? What? No.  Communists hate America.  No, American and Russian and Chinese are fighting together for communism.  No, against fascism! And that was   Ow! Ouch.  Ya think?! Ya think ouch, do ya? The guerillas! They will kill me, let me go! They\'ll kill me! Pull me up, or I will kill you! At least give me the gun.  I\'ll give you the bullets! You would rather we both die?! I\'m honestly kind of on the fence! Oh, shut up.  Hey.  And here\'s your office, Ms.  Archer And if the rest of you will follow me, we\'ve still got a lot to cover.  But it\'s all just the same as it was.  Exactly.  That\'s the whole point.  But it almost would\'ve been cheaper to build a time machine and go back to before the office got blown up.  We looked into that! But that technology doesn\'t exist! I\'ll catch up, I gotta run in here real quick and grab some urinal cakes.  Why the hell do you need urinal cakes? For my shower at home.  Oh, lord.  Gross.  Ms.  Archer looks like a mule kicked her in the face.  How\'s the water? Sweet baby James, it is perfect.  Um uh Pam.  Pam.  Yes, of course, I know you\'re   So I gained the weight back.  Sue me.  No, I was   Look, my therapist says everybody\'s got a hole that needs to be filled.  Some people fill it with drugs, some fill it with work, some fill it with between meal snacks and liquor and their therapist\'s cock.  Um, I was actually looking at your pubic hair.  Oh, yeah.  It\'s a lightning bolt, but I guess the letters could use a touch up.  It\'s supposed to say "TCB. " "Takin\' care of beaveness. " Super.  Kampai.  Kampai.  Is that medicine? Painkillers.  Mixed with candy.  I call \'em "Mike and Vikes. " Hm.  I\'m sorry about your foot.  Why? It\'s not your   Wait, you led me right into that damn tiger trap?! My orders were to defend this island from the enemy until I was relieved.  I\'m not   America\'s not your enemy! Japan has no enemies! You\'re like I wanna say a platypus, but I\'m not sure if that\'s an accurate analogy.  You were saying something before you fell in, about the communists? Huh? Oh, yeah.  Like, literally the day after the war ended, the U. S.  and Russia became mortal enemies.  China, too.  Called the Cold War.  Then we kinda became friends again.  So, now you are Now I\'m actually not sure where we stand.  We left it kinda weird.  Who is we? I do not understand.  So, I work with, and used to date, a woman named Lana, who got pregnant.  Well yes, but you can hardly blame Sterling for being upset, I mean   Ugh, even the ice is the same! That hint of bleach.  Anyway, you didn\'t ask if you could use his goop.  What?! Malory, the whole thing about me using his "goop" was your idea! Prove it.  So now let\'s talk about this name, Abbiejean.  Don\'t you think she\'d be better off if she were a Malory? Thoughts? You do not want to know my thoughts.  I do, Ken.  I much very do.  You\'re a major dickhole.  And you\'re kind of a mean drunk.  My wife, Hatsumi, and my daughter, Keiko.  Do you know what I would give to have seen her grow up? Yeah, but   And now you have the chance I never had, but you just throw it away.  I mean, ya know, I\'m going back, obviously, I\'m gonna parent the shit outta that kid, I just   I just needed some time or space or whatever, you know, to kinda Dickhole.  The March of News! The tide of war in the Pacific is finally changing, as U. S.  Marines attack the Japs on the island of Guadalcanal.  I dunno.  Some cereal.  It\'s supposed   supposed to be good for you.  What\'s that   what, what   What\'s that?! What the  ? Oh.  Morning, Ken.  So I know this a long shot, but do you know how to make eggs Woodhouse? Ken? Ken, what are you doing   Victory in the Pacific! Japan finally surrenders, brought to her knees by the explosion of two atomic bombs What? No, no, no! No, Ken.  Turn it off.  The first, dropped on Hiroshima, and the second, on Nagasaki.  I, uh, I   I\'m sorry.  Why? Why? Why are you sorry?! That you had to see that.  That it even happened in the f   Sneak attack.  Typical.  Aiyah! Hello? Goddammit.  Mother Mother, it\'s   Well, listen up, Vinny voicemail.  I hope you check your messages, because if you don\'t retrieve that computer and meet the extraction team within the next two hours, you can just get used to bananas! If you\'d like to make a call Even the damn phone is the same.  Everything is the same.  Jesus! Okay, so, Ken, we\'ve got a situation.  We don\'t have anything.  You have a situation.  I am going home to Japan! Well unless you wanna swim there   which, spoiler alert, you can\'t, it\'s too far   you\'re gonna need my help! Ha! Because you also need my help.  Only because you just broke two of my ribs, in addition to impaling me on a bamboo stake, on which, I think we both know, you smeared some poop! I   And if you did I don\'t wanna know! Because you\'d have no idea what you\'re supposed to be looking for! Not that I do, necessarily, but   Will you please hurry? Keep your raggedy bits of shirt on! That looks pretty computery to me.  So now all I have to do is   Shit.  Come.  We must go now.  Not yet.  I gotta blow this thing.  Then blow it, and then come.  I mean, really? It\'s like why even   I\'m sorry! No, no, no, no, no! Hey, remember that time you broke some of my ribs?! And then all the remaining ones? It\'s your own fault.  My fault   oh, shit, I didn\'t blow it! What?! I was supposed to blow up the plane! No, what\'re you   I\'ll just lie! You cannot shirk your duty! Yes, I can! I do it all the time! Goddammit.  Asshole! Which way to the extraction point? Uh I guess head for the beach? Well? Yeah, it\'s nice, although, I assumed there\'d be a bar.  You said this was the extraction point.  Uh, no, I merely implied that.  I have no idea where it is.  Although Ah, so you did know.  No, I totally didn\'t.  Swear to God.  Things just usually work out for me.  Which I kinda take for granted.  You Archer? Duh! So, ready to go home? I think no.  I have been gone far too long.  My family, even if they are still alive, surely by now they have moved on.  Uh huh.  It would not be fair to them, if I were to return after so many years.  Yeah, return to, uh Where did you and Hatsumi and Keiko used to live? Hm? Oh, Takamori.  A very small town, in Nagano prefecture, but   Moshi moshi.  Hatsumi? Sato Hatsumi? Hai.  Hatsumi Kentaro San? Hatsumi.  Hey, there\'s this new thing we have called a schedule.  We need a minute! Captain shit nuts! Tell her I said hi.  Nope.  No, no, huh uh, no.  You don\'t disappear for six weeks, and then just waltz in here like you never left, and casually say, "Hi"! First of all, Lana, I didn\'t waltz in here, not with nine broken ribs, a punctured lung, severe penetration trauma to my foot, and poop related septicemia!   And also crabs.    Ugh! I assume from the jungle.  Oh please, if   Not to mention that stupid computer, which is why you\'re upset, I mean jealous, because I aced the mission! What? And you did blow up the plane? The plane blew up! Yes! I don\'t   Jealous? Oh, shut up.  Hey! I\'m not jealous about the mission.  I\'m upset because no one knew where you were.  And if, huge if, you\'re gonna be involved, oh my God, in any sort of parental role for Abbiejean.  No, yeah, and I, ya know, I want to.  But are we married to Abbiejean, or? Believe me, I tried.  Zip it, gee baw! No! I will not be called gee baw.  It\'s grandmother Archer or nothing! Then hush.  Because we, you and I, are gonna have to establish some ground rules.  Lana, they\'re just gonna get broken.  I am now going to feed our child.  If you\'d like to talk while I do so, follow me.  I would! I would love to talk, Lana.  Just don\'t wanna have to listen.  And how about this renovation, huh? I can\'t believe they pulled it off.  What? You knew about this?! Yeah, I was on the planning committee.  I\'m not a huge fan of change.  Except for you, Milton!Wait.  What happened? I thought you were going to renovate this place.  As did I, but I was betrayed by a lying little country music wannabe.  Was that directed at me? Yes! Who else? I don\'t know who all lies to you! Also, there\'s a Mr.  Slater to see you.  Just "Slater. " It\'s a mononym, like   Jesus Christ! Nope.  He\'s in here, you ritzy ditz! What are you doing, Dave? So, uh, should I come back? No.  No, no, no, no, no.  Of course not.  Yeah, that\'s what I was thinking.  I mean, whatever the task, we are up to it.  We are professional and   There\'s a Mr.  Slater to see you.  I\'m gonna go.  Good.  Why are you here in the first place? Mr.  Slater   Just "Slater"! And hang on.  Excuse me, are you and I gonna have a problem? I mean, I\'m sure we will at some point, but   Sterling! Mr.    Just "Slater".  Has   Had   an important assignment for us, which I\'m sure we can kick right through the basket for a homerun.  I\'m gonna go.  Look, you\'re already here.  Why not just tell us what the mission is? I will, but only because I choose to.  One of our   well, I guess you could call him a freelancer   What do you call him? I call him a freelancer.  So shut up, please.  Anyway, he needs an extraction from Buenos Aires.  Ugh, it\'s just us.  You can say, "Bwaynos Air eez. " And   hush.  And what operation is the CIA conducting in Argentina? Oh, sorry.  It\'s called "Operation Nunya. " I   As in "beeswax," Lana.  Yes, I   Dr.  Kane, report to the burn unit.  To help a patient who\'s been burned? No.  Anyway   his cover\'s been blown.  Argentine intelligence is onto him, and he needs an extraction A. S. A. G. D. M. F. P.  So, why us? Why not keep it in house at CIA? Because, turns out, you actually know this operator.  Uh, do you mind? Hmm? Oh.  Conway Stern? Yes, Conway Stern.  Questions? Yeah, can I start? You guys mind if I start? I\'ll start.  Are you out of your shitting mind? Sterling! Excuse me? He literally stabbed me in the back! Because you jeopardized his mission.  What mission? To sell classified military technology to the Chinese? Phony technology we  wanted  China to have.  They\'ve been chasing their tails on the whisper drive for years.  Oh.  "Oh"? I knew it.  In my heart of hearts, I knew he was one of the good guys.  Literally! The back! Stabbed it! Well, then you people ripped off his hands, so After he literally stabbed me! In the back! Oh, give it a rest, Sterling.  I\'m sure you did something to deserve it.  What  ? But now you have a chance to right that wrong, which is a rare thing.  About as rare as getting called up to the majors from single a ball   Hey! Lana.  I assume that was a sports analogy meant to be cutting, but we will take the mission, won\'t we, Sterling? Huh? Yeah.  Oh, sorry.  It\'s just I\'m worried, my entire life, I\'ve been misusing the word "literally"! And certainly overusing.    You\'re not worried?   Why should I worry? Because I\'m the one that ripped of Conway\'s hand? No.  About   Or that he\'ll double cross us again? Which, a blowjob says he does.  And mother and Slater and the CIA are idiots for trusting him, but I\'m talking about us flying on the same plane, Lana.  What if it crashed? Then I wouldn\'t have had to watch you pound 20 drinks and then try to talk the stewardess into a handjob.  Where are you getting 20 drinks? Uh, from ten doubles.  "A", those were mini bottles, and two, I\'m talking about A. J. , Lana.  Who\'s going to take care of her if something happens to both of us? Well, me.  Obviously.  You think   Okay.  Wow.  You think, in the event of their deaths, that you would be A. J. \'s legal guardian? Who else would they possibly choose? You\'ve met yourself, right? If it\'s anybody around here, it\'s me.  Of course.  The one who smokes next to the baby.  Dukes! Ray! You know   All right, Virginia Slim.  You\'re   Nap time! I have a meeting.  Good bye.  Look, don\'t worry about A. J. , okay? Well, I think one of us should.  No, I   And I vote for mother and Woodhouse.  To raise my child? Our  child, Lana.  And yes.  And   Can we talk about this later? Oh, we\'re definitely gonna talk about it later, I can promise you that.  And   Can you promise that even though Conway   Literally     stabbed you in the back, that you won\'t do anything revenge y and stupid when he opens the door? Hmm.  I want to say No! Revenge rampage! A ya! A ya! You mother   How do you still have two hands? You cyborg son of a bi   You\'re outof sugar.  Oh, good.  You\'re making tea.  \'Cause I could use some with honey and lemon.  And bourbon.  But actually, without the honey and lemon and the tea.  So just bourbon.  Yeah, I doubt if   Oh, shut up.  Don\'t ruin it.  I had something for   Puke Skywalker? Mm.  God damn it! Anyway, I doubt the robot has any bourbon, and I\'m not really in the mood for a WD 40 and coke.  Unless that is, literally, the only thing to drink.  I think I might be concussed.  Hell hath no fury, huh? Meaning? As a woman scorned.  Lana, remember? I kinda scorned you last time we met? Yeah, you are definitely concussed.  Not to mention a decepticon! Where the hell did you get a bionic hand? Uh So what\'s new? How you been? Sharper image? Uh huh.  Sounds more like Krieger.  Jesus Christ! Will he not rest until we\'ve all been enslaved by Skynet? Hey, we are leaving in five, so   Right after I enjoy this mate  and  caa  smoothie with a WD 40 float.  Although "enjoy" is maybe a bit strong.  Ugh.  Conway, grab whatever you need, presumably some fresh nine volts, and let\'s get this extraction going.  I can\'t.  I don\'t have the intel yet.  What intel? Slater said, "extraction. " When he asked us to come rescue you.  From what? Your mom\'s antique vagina? You son of a   Hey! Enough, you two! Tell him that! Pretty sure I just did.  Now, what and where is this "intel"? It\'s a computer file with the real identity of every single CIA agent operating in central and South America.  Argentina\'s using it for leverage, threatening to trade it to the Soviets.  Wait.  Isn\'t Argentina our ally? You\'d think, right? After we threw them that lovely coup? So, the file is on the mainframe computer of the Argentine secret intelligence service.  Okay.  Here\'s what we do   How about maybe let him finish? Hmm.  Okay.  But then we go with my plan.  The mainframe is a standalone in a secure vault.  Hardened, keycard, and retinal scan entry.  On the top floor of the intelligence building itself, which is heavily guarded at all times, by Argentine special ops on standing orders to shoot to kill any and all unauthorized personnel.  You mentioned something about a plan? I mean, he obviously thinks he has a plan, so whatever.  Let\'s hear it.  Where is it? Where\'s what? What are you   I flushed it! I will kill you! Where you stand! Hey! Is it too much to ask, during the goddamn work day, for two separate sessions of 80 uninterrupted minutes each of quality dump time? I mean, I\'m not a labor attorney.  Yes, it is entirely too much to ask! I thought so, yeah.  So I\'ll pass that on to who or whomever asked.  And if you harmed one single hair on her little brown head, I will   Whose head? Wait, do what? Baby A. J. ! She\'s missing! Oh, my God! Oh, thank God! And since you are the only one around here who hates babies   Just baby people.  Whoa, whoa, whoa! Come on! I\'m sure   wait.  Did you murder the baby? Uh uh.  No, but like "swearsie realsies"? Swearsie realsies.  And that\'s pretty sacred to us, so we\'ll go help you look for baby A. J.  In, like, five teen, 40 minutes.  And so Conway\'s plan doesn\'t strike you as unnecessarily complicated? No, Lana, it doesn\'t.  And it doesn\'t strike you as "Brazilian minstrel show meets  Trading Places"? No, Lana, it doesn\'t.  And that\'s not just because you get to wear that ri dork ulous facerug.  No, Lana, it   look.  If I have to pull this car over, we\'re all gonna be murdered, so Just get us in the damn garage, man.  Hey! You\'re not the boss of me! Archer, just   Or you! I don\'t care if you are the president and first lady of Brazil on a pan American goodwill tour of intelligence headquarters es.  Coronel Lando Calrissiano, de Las Fuerzas Especiales, doesn\'t work for you! Although he has nailed his backstory.  Lando Cal  ? Por qu no te callas? Will you shut up? I need to think! Don\'t yell at me, I didn\'t lose her.  Now just try to retrace your steps.  Well, I wasn\'t in the sofa cushions.  Agh! Well, you could have said that! I did.  I thought you were being sarcastic! It is kinda hard to tell with you.  Okay, here we go.  Conway, shut up and try to look semi presidential.  And Lana, try to look   actually, yeah.  Matronly.  You nailed it.  You know So anyways   Ay! Coronel! Um, okay.  Su carat, Coronel, por favor.  Uh,  bueno.  Conmigo estan y su Esposa Grande.  Por supuesto, Coronel Cal Espere.  Lando? Calrissiano?! Okay, so here\'s the thing with that.  Boring conversation anyway.  God damn it, Archer! That\'s Coronel Calrissiano to you! Archer! Don\'t drive angry! What the hell are you doing? I\'m archer izing this plan! What? No, no! Uh uh.  You cannot make yourself a verb! I will not allow it.  I\'m a verb now, Lana.  Deal with it! And then, also, cover me, please.  Idiotas! Um Hijos de puta! Conmigo estan y su esposa! Y mira! Mira aqu! Sucia! Sucia! Todos! Todos las armas on the ground! Uh,  perdn? On the ground, Pyle! What are you   Oh.  Uh, see how I switched to English? Uh, I was testing him.  Good work, Pyle.  Su carta, Coronel, por favor.  How about a big hand for Pyle, gang? Lana! Archer! Lana! Lana! What are you, jealous I\'m a verb? Su carta, Coronel! Por favor.  Jesus Christ, Pyle! I heard you.  Archer! What are you doing? Shooting out the glass.  No, no, no! Don\'t! It\'s   Bulletproof.  Archer! So, uh, how come you and I didn\'t hook up last time we worked together? Well, "A", you were too busy banging Cheryl or Carol or Cristal   Oh, right.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  The crazy Jew Santa chick.  And "B" through "Z", because you\'re a large diameter dickhole.  Mm hmm.  Well, you\'re looking good, girl.  Lot curvier than I remember.  I had a baby.  Oh.  Sorry.  Never mind.  Never mind what? Like, name it.  You know Oh.  So, you done archer izing? Because, you jackass, to recap, you locked us in the stupid limo! Well, I still don\'t see why that means I\'m the one who has to carry Pyle.  Well, then slice out his retinas, okay? I can\'t.  It would kill Lou Ann.  Oh, and speaking of   God damn it! Ay! Speaking of what? If something happens to both of us, who\'s gonna take care of the baby? Her baby\'s yours? Can we please put a pin in this? No, Lana, we can\'t! I want to know why you don\'t want it to be mother.  Because, how did you lose a baby? She was right there in the pram.  I made a drink, my furrier called.  Spoiler alert, he\'s robbing me blind.  I called immigration, tried to get his father deported.  I made another drink, but I was out of ice, so I     What?   What is it? Krieger! He was skulking around out there while I went out to get ice.  Come on, to that Nazi freak\'s lab! Hey, whoa! Are guns really necessary? \'Cause I\'m seriously asking.    Seriously?   Yes, Lana, seriously.  Why isn\'t my mother good enough to raise A. J. ? No! Don\'t shoot! There\'s a baby! And why? Why do you have the baby? Oh, my God! Okay.  So, here\'s the thing with that.  That isa nightmare.    Seriously?   Goddamn, dude.  You were going to make her a robot? I wish.  I mean, no! No.  I was doing market research for the TB 800 A. K. A.  Cyberneddly Teddly.  Oh, please! That\'s a baby skeleton.  No, but   once I figure out how to grow actual bear tissue to cover it   Goddamn, dude! Dude! Damn! How creepy! Damn! No, wait! Teddly\'s heresomewhere.  Or was.  I swear! He   Teddly? Teddly?! Cyril, secure the child.  And the rest of you, I can\'t see any benefit in telling Lana what happened here today.  Understood? Yeah.  Aw! I\'m not saying nothing.  I\'m on board for that.  And Krieger I swear to God, if I catch you near this child again, But   and the implied threat here is that I will shoot you in the genitals, and then sit here sipping amontillado sherry while you bleed to death.  Mee beep.  Ta da! Oh.  Yeah, thanks, Mr.  Bear jangles.  Wait, you already knew the code? Of course he did.  He\'s a cyborg.  It was probably Gaius Baltar\'s   Archer? You double crossing son of a bitch! Called it.  Well, yeah.  Come on.  We all saw this coming.  Now, drop them.  I was gonna say "zip code," guys   Okay, idiots, thanks for helping me get the disk.  The Soviets are going to pay out the  zadnitsa for this thing.  But you could have gotten the disk yourself.  Why drag us into it? Well, I knew dick van head over there could pass for a Latino to get us in.  Nailed it.  But mostly for revenge.  Remember how you ripped off my hand, woman?! Yeah, vaguely, but if it\'s revenge you want, why don\'t you shoot me? I was going to, but come on.  I\'m not a monster.  You just had a kid.  Me too, though.  And what are you doing in the window? Base! Jumping.  This is a parachute.  Well, Conway you win this round.  Who are you? Wait.  Hang on.  Horatio Kane.  God damn it.  But "Kane" obviously spelled   I got it.  Oh, and hey, give me a call if things don\'t work out with the kid.  Wh   And you lose the baby weight.  Areyoukidding me? Yeah! Lose that weight, Conway Stern! Or whatever your real name is! I lied! That is my real name! Maw, they got ol\' Lando this time.  I\'m done for.  Archer, shut up.  You\'re gonna be okay.  You really think so? I mean, maybe.  Although that can\'t bode well.  You get the disk? Slater? Did you get the disk? Yes, idiot.  And, also, several bullets, so   Then come on, get in the back.  I got a plane waiting at an airstrip.  So, hey, about this blowjob   Shut up! Conway was a traitor.  He was gonna sell the disk to the Soviets.  Yeah, yeah.  We kinda suspected that.  "Kinda"? So you sent us into a   Wait.  So you followed us down here? Come on.  We\'re not gonna put a couple of untested rookies in the starting line up of game seven of the world   Seriously, okay, as I was saying   God damn it, Archer! I am not giving you a blowjob! Not that.  A. J.  If something happens to us.  I really don\'t think that this is the time to talk about that.  When then? Why don\'t you want to talk about it, Lana? Because I\'m afraid it\'ll hurt your feelings.  Because, if anything happens to me, and   just me, Archer   then A. J.  would live with my parents.  Oh.  Yeah.  Uh, I I I guess that makes sense.  They\'re probably pretty old, though, right? And if anything happened to them, then A. J.  would live with my sister.  You have a sister? Yes, Archer, I have a sister.  She younger?I dunno, it just feels weird.  That\'s just the altitude, dummy.  I\'m talking about the   Try popping your ears, go like this Mawp, mawp, mawp, mawwwwwwp! Goddammit, it\'s not my ears! What? Sorry, my ears won\'t pop.  Ray, did you bring gum? No.  Well great, trip\'s ruined.  Sorry, Ray forgot to bring gum   I\'m talking about the fact that we\'re about to climb a Swiss goddamn frickin Alp to assassinate somebody! The target\'s an assassin, Lana, not a king, or a pope, or a   vice pope.  So it\'s not assassination.  It\'s just a extrajudicial killing.  And that makes it better.  Yes, Lana, that\'s why they made up a whole different word for it.  And the CIA told mother the target has killed judges and prosecutors and bankers and generals all over the world, so God knows how many actual assassinations we\'ll be preventing.  And of course your mother would do anything to impress the CIA.    So   Oh my God! You have to try this! Hot cocoa, dark creme de cacao, hint of creme de menthe, and peppermint schnapps.  I call it a Peppermint Patty.  Here.  Wow, that is your major loss.  Ooh, can I try it? No.  How hard is it to remember gum? Okay, so tonight we infiltrate this swanky climbing party.  Then tomorrow we extra judicially kill this guy.  Yeah, or woman.  Wait, what? Excuse me? We kill whoever it is.  You don\'t know who the target is? I mean Ugh, God dammit.  And since you obviously didn\'t read the mission dossier   For your information, Lana I skimmed it.  And bully for you.  Give it here.  Ah.  God dammit! Where the hell is it? I assume on the back of my toilet.  What, Lana? Look at all the shit I had to pack.  I don\'t know what people are gonna be wearing for apres montee! S   And Ray didn\'t bring the gum! Ah.  Witch Just like every car trip I ever took with mom and daddy.  Only I\'m not getting whipped with a fan belt.  Lana, wait! I just remembered a crucial detail about the target.  I made a mental note of it at the time.  Oh! Oh, my And you must be our late reservations.  Good to see some fellow Americans.  I\'m your guide, Crash McCarran.  Is   um I thought there were three of you.  One of us is weeping in the car.  Oh.  Uh, okay, well, come on in and meet the rest of the climbing party.  That\'s Hans Hessler, from Germany.  Guten Abend.  Mario Savino, from Italy Buonasera.  And Michiko Ishikawa, from Japan.  Konbanwa.  We\'re just heading into the bar for some gluhwein.  Why don\'t you join us when you\'re ready? Well? What\'s this "crucial detail" you remembered about the target? The target was from a country that in World War Two, was an Axis power.  Ray forgot the gum.  So how\'d you get the name Crash? Oh, it\'s a long story about me saving the lives of eight other climbers right after an avalanche.  Sploosh.  Sploosh.  Sorry? Is I bet the sound an avalanche makes.  Uh, no, it\'s more like a freight train full of tornadoes, which are in turn full of smaller freight trains.  Which are in turn full of shit.  Sorry? She just had a baby.  Ya know I didn\'t.  Okay, well, we\'ve got an extremely difficult climb tomorrow, guys, so you might wanna take it easy on the C\'mon, if you\'ve climbed it how hard can it be? Die Totenspitz For those of you who don\'t speak German, that means Herr Hessler? Ze peak of death.  Fifteen thousand feet of some of the most dangerous climbing in all of Europe.  Unstable seracs, frequent avalanches, and hundreds of crevasses that can swallow entire climbing parties in a split second.  One in every seven climbers who has dared to climb die Totenspitz has paid with his life.  So yes, she\'s earned her name, alri    Okay people, I want a good alpine start tomorrow, so pack your gear and get some sleep.  We head out at dawn.  And that\'s A. M. ? As opposed to? P. M.  dawn? Set adrift on memory bliss.  Come on, buddy.  The mountain is dangerous Very dangerous So you should watch your step.  Okay, great climb, everybody! Yaaaaaaay So, instead of antagonizing the person responsible for our safety   What, shamelessly flirt with him? Was it obvious? Maybe call Malory on the sat phone, and find out who the damn target is! One step ahead of you! May I please have the sat phone? Rrrgh It\'s mother\'s fault anyway, Lana, you\'re obviously the one she should\'ve    What? Mother   Hey, it\'s me, quick question    Let me guess    Oh, how\'s A. J. ? Because if the rash came back, what she needs to    Shut up, please? Although actually yes, how is A. J. ? That\'s why you called? Uh, no, actually I\'m calling because    You haven\'t the foggiest idea what it is you\'re supposed to be doing.  Ugh, I know what, mother, I just don\'t know   Let me speak to Lana.    Who?   Lana! No, I meant    Sterling, let me speak to   No! Because you\'re gonna tell her she\'s agent in command, so that when she\'s not pathetically trying to make me jealous by hitting on this idiot beard face sweater model, she\'s gonna lord it over me and Ray, who, by the way, forgot to bring gum! Are you finished?   Yes.    Good, because The voice mailbox of Elaborate voicemail hoax is full.  Goodbye.  Huh.  I guess you had that coming.  Wh ? How so? Gimme that And if I wanted to make you jealous   What? Shut up.  Let me talk to Malory.  Make me, and also hang on.  What the stupid shit are you doing? You said you wanted watermelon! Watermelon\'s red? Wh ? Yes! How do you not know that? Who am I, Charles Fedric Adrus? She didn\'t come in today.  Well where is she? Well, I assume somewhere else.  It\'s like Yeah, right? Ya find it? No Find what? Nothing.  Just don\'t make any sudden movements.  Bowel or otherwise.  Wh ? Why would we make a sudden bowel movement? Don\'t worry about it.  Rrgh! No answer at home, no answer on her cell! So not only do we not know who the target is, now your mother has absconded with my child! Yes, but on the plus side, there are seven of us, so if one out of seven climbers dies on this mountain maybe we\'ll get lucky.  Yeah, maybe it\'ll be you.  No, not me, dummy, I meant   oh, I get it.  I see what you did there.  Really? Yes.  C\'mon, c\'mon Pick up, pick up, pick up   Mmblello? Oh thank God, you\'re still at the office.  I am? Aw, maaan Pam, I need you to find   Yaagh! Pam! What? Goddammit! I need you to   Shut up!   And listen! I need you to check Malory\'s apartment for me.  All right, pick it up, people! The weather\'s good now but it can change on a dime! Michiko, right there, that\'s your line.  Now, stay on it, and work across toward the ridge.  Hai, okay.  Looking good guys, looking real good! Oh, this old thing? It\'s just    Keep walking.  Uh huh.  Yep.  Sat phone? Yeah, sorry, I was just   Keep it handy.  I\'m getting a majorly weird vibe from um   from one of the other climbers.  Oh, yeah, no, just tell him you\'re not interested.  No, not him, one of the others.  Yeah what\'s up, what\'re we doing? Uh, besides jeopardizing the entire rope line by being out of position? Yes, obviously besides that.  Crash has a bad feeling about one of the other climbers.  Oh, he\'s harmless, just tell him   Not Ray.  One of the others.  Aha.  And also ah who? Well, look, maybe it\'s nothing, but   Get down! You\'re not my supervi  ! Oh, no! Hang on! Whoa whoa whoa whoa! Hang on! I got a key, ya skimpnuts.  Oh yeah, me, too.  Why do you have keys to her apartment? Ron gave them to us, when they were doing that weird open house thing.  Open marriage.  Oh.  Well that explains that You both had sex with hopefully Ron? Don\'t worry about it.  Don\'t worry about it.  But I just wanna say, breaking into Ms.  Archer\'s apartment to hopefully find a crying baby clinging to her dead and shriveled body is the best birthday present I\'ve ever gotten.  Except for that Formula One team.  Dibs on snacks.  Looks like Pam\'s lucky night because of the snacks, ya dickholes! Although Michiko! Michikooooo! I can\'t see her! There\'s a ledge! Hang on, I\'m coming! Do not move! Don\'t move! Everybody stay put, keep the weight spread out! I\'m gonna clip on, abseil down on a v thread, and try to reach her! I\'m gonna blip blorp, blobba do dob onna beep borp, check out mah beard! Little jealous? Little bit, yeah.  No no no, damn it! Guys, be ready to pull on my command! And we gotta hurry.  A storm\'s coming! Um, should somebody call the Ghostbusters? Okay, here goes! And pull on my command! So, will your feelings be super hurt if I bang him? Yes! No, nothing in the study.  Krieger, how about the other guest bedroom? No, nothing.  No sign of Ms.  Archer or the baby Pam, how about in the kitchen? Pam? No, nothing.  Wh ? You better be eating snacks! Ew! Wait, yeah, where is Carol? Growrrrf! Oh, God, somebody kill me.  We thought you threw up.  Ew.  Ew.  What\'re you   Is that a radish? And literally the most fattening thing in the entire goddamn fridge.  No wonder she\'s so frickin skinny.  Everything else is in plastic bags.  What was that? Don\'t worry about it.  Okay, ready? Ready! Pull! Okay, okay! Ease up, ease up Was?!  Wo ist Michiko?! She\'s dead.  Gott im Himmel Dio mio The fall must\'ve broken her neck.  Oh, my God Well, now, that could be very good for us.  Japan? Axis power? Okay people, listen up! We\'ve got a blizzard rolling in on us right now! There\'s no time to descend! We\'ve gotta bivouac right here, right now! C\'mon, people, let\'s move! B but, what about Michiko?! You mean her body.  But   She\'s dead, but we\'re alive! And you never let the dead jeopardize the entire party! Now, you would know that if you were an experienced climber like you said you were! You think it\'s Hessler? Axis power Germany Axis power Italy Then yeah, I dunno.  Goddammit.  Okay, listen up, people! Now, we\'ve only got two bivvy tents! Ta daaa! And two bivvy sacks! But that\'s okay, because it\'s gonna hit 70 below, so if we wanna live, we\'re gonna have to combine our body heat.  Wait, do huh? So what we\'re gonna do is strip down naked.  We\'re gonna go three to a tent, three to a bag! And I actually have some thoughts on that, who should go where wise! We go wiss him! Americans go zair! Well, now, let\'s just hear him out at least! As if No, she was totally in there.  Hurry up, dammit! Get in your tent, huddle up, and hang on tight! The wind\'s probably gonna hit a hundred miles    Shut the goddamn door! What\'re you    zip it up! I am, obviously! If you\'d shut up! Wh ?! Nooope! What? I am not ridin\' bitch in this tent! You have to! It\'s the only way to keep Ray\'s genitals away from mine! Oh, as if! Uh uh, no.  No.  Ray is the DMZ.  Goddammit Oh, please, I oughta be worried about your dirty old junk touching mine Ray, if I ever have sex with a man, it\'ll be a man who remembers the gum.  And, not that it matters, also black.  Eat a dick, blizzard.  Can you see anything? Besides snow? Yes, Archer, besides snow.  Hang on Hang on No.  Well, now nobody\'s answering their damn phones.  I tried Cyril, Pam, Cheryl, now I\'m even trying Krieger! Where the hell is everybody?  Teutonic butts   teutonic butts   white on white butts   white on white butts  Seriously, I swear to God, somebody please come in here and kill me I would if I had the strength, dick! What\'d I do? You poisoned us! With that stupid ceviche nobody asked you to bring! You asked me to bring it! I didn\'t know what ceviche was! Uh, hey guys? What do you want? What is it? I don\'t think it was the ceviche Huh.  What, can you see something? Uh yeah.  Well? You wanna share it with the rest of the   Jesus Christ! That\'s Hessler and Savino Who I think just did our job for us, because we are out of Axis powers.  Mornin\', gang! Who\'s ready for a piping hot cup of fair trade practices? What the hell happened to them? Hypothermia.  No shit, they\'re naked in the snow! It\'s called paradoxical undressing.  You see it sometimes with severe hypothermia.  The poor bastards rip off all their clothes and run out into the snow.  With belts on their necks? What\'s that? Oh.  Yeah, man, that hypothermia make ya do some pretty crazy shit.  But   Irish bastard! What? What\'s that? McCarran! That\'s an Irish name! Uh, yeah, Scotch Irish, but I\'m actually Canadian    Save the blarney for the Colleens, Paddy! What? Archer, what\'re you    He\'s the target! What? I just remembered, from the dossier! Patrick McCarran, mountain climbing enthusiast, slash assassin! Okay, first of all Lana! Lana! Yeah, that\'s true.  Although I prefer the term "cleaner" to "assassin. " Well that\'s just smart branding.  And I\'m actually Canadian, not Irish.  As is that.  Those jagoffs and the Japanese broad were from Interpol.  They\'ve been on me for months, but obviously didn\'t know I was on to them.  I sent her down into that crevasse, then went down in there and broke her neck for her.  Those two, well that\'s kinda self explanatory.  They died in your arms Hang on   Lana, hush.  Yeah, shut up.  I thought you three were just some idiot wannabe tourists, but now can I assume you\'re CIA? No! You know what, Patty? Hang on! Lana, I said shut up.  I said shut up.  And I said hang the frickin shit on! Okay, God So where did you get Axis power! Ireland? Again, I\'m actually Canadian.  And Ireland was not an Axis power! You sure? They were neutral! You asshole! Oh, that\'s right.  Gaping asshole.  Because I dunno what your plan was with that gun, but there\'s about four feet of new wet snow on top of the ice crust, so if you fire that thing, I guarantee you it\'s gonna trigger an avalanche.  Well Paddy, if there\'s one thing I\'ve learned Wait, wait, Archer? It\'s that there\'s no guarantees in this crazy world.  No, no, no   I   that   you   the   that   I believe the phrase you\'re searching for is "Thank you, Archer.  That was  " What\'s that sound? What was that? It\'s an avalanche! You you And I believe the phrase you\'re searching for is Holy shit, is that really an   Avalanche! Whoo hoo! And exactly what are you doing with those bags? I don\'t live on the sidewalk, you mope.  Take them upstairs.  Where the hell is A. J. ? With me, she\'s fine.  I was having my apartment bug bombed, so I took her to the Plaza.  I\'ll call you back.  And what fresh hell is this? Can you believe that shit? Absconds with my child and she\'ll call me back? No, seriously, I mean can you believe that shit? Can you believe this other shit? Peppermint patties! Still warm! Plenty more where that came fr   How could you possibly be that excited to be in a frickin avalanche? I have kind of a weird bucket list.  Number three, bang Joe Frazier.  Really regret sharing that with you So, you think Crash is dead, or? I mean, he\'d have to be, right? And either way I say we say he\'s dead.  Yeah, right? Seems like a win win.  Unless you\'re him or the other three.  But seriously, how in the hell did you think Ireland was an Axis power? Oh, my God, I think this whole time I was actually thinking of Romania but only as an inevitable consequence of the Molotov Ribbentrop pact and the Soviet invasion of Bessarabia.What\'s wrong? My my my my   Pam.  Pam! My my my my   sis sis sis sis   Hold this.  Ow! God dammit, dude.  Well, I\'m sorry, but I\'ve got other shit to do today.  Now, what the hell is wrong with you? My sister Edie is getting married to Don Ekblad, Jr.  of all people, and she asked me to be a bridesmaid.  Um I should be maid of honor, dicknuts, but no, guess who she asks instead? Uh Midge Olerud! No! Yes.  Midge "Hey Edie, "let\'s me and you blow Pam\'s boyfriend Arn behind the goddamn grain elevator" Olerud! You had a boyfriend named Arn? Well, he didn\'t know I liked him, but   Midge and Edie did.  Pam! Okay, Jesus.  Calm down, Ike Turner.  I don\'t want to show up with a black eye.  Not a real diverse crowd, huh? Eye, idiot, eye.  Although, no.  Not a lot of black guys in rural Wisconsin.  And, I don\'t want to sound racist, but   Power through it.  A black guy would be better than no date, which is what I\'m taking now.  When is it? Saturday.  Day after tomorrow.  Screw it, I\'ll go.  Really? Really, really, really? Yeah, why not? Oh, man.  Wait till they see   Wait, that\'s how you ask a woman out? Yes.  Wait, no, I don\'t need a back story.  Yes you do.  Shut up.  You\'re Gordon Shumway, and you own a 500 acre dairy farm in upstate New York, with 600 Holsteins and two Herringbone milking parlors.  Okay, A, that\'s Alf\'s name, and two, what\'s more impressive, a pathetic cheese farmer or the world\'s greatest secret agent, A. K. A. , me, Sterling Archer.  Oh, yeah.  Attention, now boarding flight 934, to Green Bay, Wisconsin.  Come on, Archer, that\'s us.  Flight 934, to Greenbay, Wisconsin.  Yeah, you\'re booked through to New York.  Will you be needing anything else? Huh? Oh, is there a place that sells down jackets and thermal underwear? I\'m, uh, what do you call it? Coldblooded.  Archer? Archer? Archer? Have you seen Archer? Did you look in here? I   that is what I\'m doing now.  Then, I guess go look everywhere else.  You know Starting with Dick cheese, Wisconsin.  Excuse me? Him and   He and Whomever, and Whoever, and If you wake this child, I will climb inside you with my shoes on.  He and Pam are at her sister\'s wedding.  In Wisconsin? Happy? No, no, no, he\'s got her all weekend.  I\'m going upstate for SERE school.  So take her with you.  To survival school? Big whoop, hang her in a bear bag.  So Mallory Nope.  Ron and I are going to our house in the Hamptons, and, trust me, it would be no place for a baby.  You\'re back together? Like, for real? And happier and stronger than ever.  Try not to burn the place down.  And you, my tweedy widdle   What, are your boobs full of corn syrup? Excuse me? Feel that, she feels chubby.  She\'s a baby.  A fat widdle baby, yes you are, yes you are.  You\'re fat widdle baby.  Fast forward to me buying her liposuction for graduation.  I hope you do burn this place down.  She said not to.  She said try not to.  You\'re kidding.  How either, in this universe, or any of it\'s infinite parallels, could I possibly embarrass you? By dressing like a maitre D\' on a dinner cruise for gay Republicans? That\'s a thing? I don\'t know, but you don\'t want Edie dogging you out in front of the entire school.  The entire what? Rehearsal dinner.  Shut up.  Come on, what happened? Did she dump pig\'s blood all over you at the prom? No, not pig\'s blood.  Wait, what? Hang on, did she really? Oh my God, Pam You look amazing.  Really? I mean, you know, relatively.  Shit ass.  But you\'ve got to pace me, I\'m sewn into this sumbitch.  So for every ounce that goes in, an ounce gotta go out.  So, diuretics? And watch this there\'s a sundae bar.  What could possibly go wrong? Who the shit is that? Is it Barry? Does that mean Barry possibly, literally froze his nuts off in the wheel well of a 747 so he could murder the shit eating Archer? Yes it does, other Barry.  Oh, yes.  Okay.  Jesus Christ.  Uh, wow.  You have got to be Edie.  Uh, I\'m Archer, uh, Pam\'s boyfriend.  Bullshit, my asshole.  Pam, hon? Edie\'s here.  And you will be civil and polite.  And you will not let her push your   Spamela! Get your fat ass out here.  Uh, she should be right out, she\'s   Yikes.  Guess I should get in there and break that up.  Wait, wait, wait, wait! Wait! Yeah, come on.  You coming? No, but hey, I know it\'s late notice, and I really hate to ask, but would you mind keeping A. J.  for the   What? I\'m hitting door open.  You can\'t see it, but I really am.  Oh, my God, it\'s just like maximum overdrive.  Ray! Lana! On Monday let\'s talk about how scary this was for me.  God dammit! Let me go! No, now just calm   Let me go! Shit, she\'s gonna   Jesus Christ, woman! Whoo! God dammit! Happy? Less than I was, to be honest.  When? When you were chugging balls behind whatever gay strip joint she hired you at? Whoa.  Told ya, it\'s that jacket.  First of all, Pam, shut up.  I\'m not the one who chugs balls behind buildings, and even if I were, they wouldn\'t belong to that dude Arn.  Oh God, you told him about Arn? Arn didn\'t even know she was alive.  Okay, you know what? Besides what Arn\'s balls taste like? I   Ah! I am out of here.  Pam, wait! Wow, and here I thought she was kidding about the pig\'s blood.  No It was   it was calf\'s blood.  Stupid, frickin\' Edie.  I\'ll show her what Arn\'s balls taste like.  Wait, what the? Barry? Hey You.  Hello? Krieger? You in here? Hey, you! What can I do you for? So, hey, um, Archer totally flaked on me.  Mallory and Ray are being lame, and Cheryl is   Cheryl.  So I was wondering if you could do me a favor.  Yep, yep, yep, but, first, who is this little person? Um, A. J. , my baby, who I\'ve had for, like, six months, who you\'ve met.  Mm kay.  Ooh, and who also has a poopy diaper.  Great Bacchus plateau, it works! What? What does? The k 9000 infrasonic pulse rifle.  What do you mean? What does it do? I assume you\'re familiar with the brown note? I am not.  What? The brown note, the frequency that makes humans shit their pants, or their onesie.  I\'m pretty sure that was a coincidence.  That\'s what they said about Tesla\'s death ray.  So, this favor Lana? Wait, Lana.  What\'s the favor? Just promise to use your powers for good! No.  Yes.  No.  Clean the jizz out of your ears, jizz ears.  I\'m getting married tomorrow, so tonight at my rehearsal dinner, I get all you can eat prime rib and bottomless vin rogue.  Gimme that.  Put it down.  We are going to go find Pam, and then you are gonna apologize for hurting her feelings.  Why do you care? You\'re just a   wait.  Are you really her boyfriend? Mm hm.  Oh, and a secret agent, so And, not only am I a secret agent, I am the world\'s greatest secret agent.  Mm hello? Jesus, Archer.  You\'re not even the greatest secret agent in that room.  Actually, Barry, that\'s where you\'re   Wait! Barry? Hey, dummy.  How did you get   where are you? How did you even know I was here? Uh, I followed you.  What do you mean, you followed me? Okay, that\'s obviously your abusive ex boyfriend, so I\'m just gonna tip on out.  I was on my way to New York to kill you, when I saw you in Chicago, idiot, and now you are gonna follow me.  That is, if you ever wanna see your buddy   uh   wait, what was your name? Your worst frickin\' nightmare.  Pam? Oh right, yeah, it\'s Pam.  Anyway, if you don\'t wanna spend the next year signing for packages full of her head and feet and shit, meet me out by the old grain elevator.  Pam says Edie knows where it is.  Now, you listen to me, Barry, you   Barry! God damn, son of a cyborg bitch! What, he give you anal warts? He kidnapped your sister, you jerk! What? Who\'d wanna kidnap Pam? I\'ll tell you in the car.  Come on! Look, I know you\'re bitter \'cause you people can\'t get married or whatever, but all you care to eat prime rib! Well, Edie, I was almost half way hoping it wouldn\'t come to this.  Come to what   Hello? Lana? No What are you still doing here? I thought you had Rambo sleepaway camp.  SERE school, and I did, but Archer hosed me, and I don\'t have a sitter.  Oh, well you should have asked   I asked everybody, even Krieger.  I   wow, so you\'d ask Krieger to watch your baby before you\'d ask me? I didn\'t, well   that would be weird.  Weirder than the guy trying to make some kind of ejaculation ray? No, it\'s a pants shitting ray.  Okay, well, then, that\'s new, but   Cyril, look   How about this? I\'ll drive you both upstate, and get us a motel room.  What? For A. J.  and me.  While you run around the woods eating snails and beetles.  That way if you get anxious about being away from her, we\'re right there.  This is weird.  Why is this weird? Because what kind of sick bastard travels with duct tape and rope? No, we actually made a couple of stops while you were knocked out.  Had to get more Tom for the Collins   Oh, and also rob a gun store.  Wait, what? Well, technically, burgle.  How long was I out? Mm 20 minutes? Dammit! Yeah, that is not good for you.  No, turn around dick nuts, I can still make the rehearsal dinner.  After we rescue Pam.  Now, shut up.  Oh, and un shut up for a second.  Is this the way to the grain elevator? Ah oh, yeah, right down that road.  Take a left.  Take a left! Even for me, that was pretty lucky.  Wa hoo! Rental car! There we go.  Looking good, Barry.  Well, thanks, other Barry.  Archer comes in to save her, and boosh! K k k kill zone! So you\'re just bug nuts crazy, huh? Crazy like a fox! Who\'s bionic! And, whose fiance dumped him, for literally the dumbest guy in Russia? Who want waffle? I forget to make waffle.  Oh, and just so you know, my worst nightmare, which is actually recurring, is me and Santa Claus getting chased through the snow by Lurch from the Adam\'s family.  Uh, why did you tell me that? Exactly.  Piece of shit rental.  You drive like aegg.  I   no, I don\'t, and also, shut up because right now I\'m going to explain what cyborgs are, and why they\'re a threat, to our entire way of life.  I mean, not now, obviously.  But, someday.  Someday soon I am gonna re hit that.  Huh? Hm? Hey, you.  Hello.  Wait.  Who\'s laws of what\'s its? Asimov\'s three laws of   look, never mind.  They don\'t even apply to Barry because he\'s a frickin\' cyborg.  Archer Come out and play.  Ugh, and also a gaping, prolapsed anus.  So, grain elevator.  Besides a place to blow farmers, what\'s the point? To store grain, dumbass.  Yeah, but you elevator it way the hell up there, then   wait, cows don\'t go up there to eat it, do they? Oh my God, no! It\'s gravity fed back down to trucks and trains and shit.  Which are on the ground.  Yes! See where I\'m going with this? Why not make it horizontal, so the cows can just walk up and eat whenever? So just a mile long trough of grain getting rained on all the damn time.  I, well, no, it\'d have a, like a a salad bar roof on it, you idiot.  Said the dumb waiter.  Get it, Archer? As in, you\'re dumb, and you dress like a waiter.  Told ya! God dammit, Pam, this is exactly what a man should wear to a   Holy shitsnacks! What the   Pam? Yeah, and just a heads up   Whoa! Dammit, Pam.  How about a   Oh, wait by heads up, did you mean  ? Seriously, Barry, why all the anger? Because Katya broke up with me! Too soon? Edie, cut me down! Oh, wow, where to start? Even in a new dress, you look like ten pounds of shit in a five pound bag.  The whole town thinks you\'re a giant asshole for moving to New York City.  You can just say New York.  Oh, and dad was right, you\'ll never find a husband unless you convince a blind man you\'re a seeing eye pig! I meant cut me down from here! Yeah.  Duh.  But you know you\'re no prize, right? Excuse me? He said   Archer! Do something! Flower box.  Shot gun.  Ow.  Hey, track suit, if anybody\'s gonna choke my sister\'s bitch neck, it\'s gonna be me.  What are you doing? What you got a little shot gun? Huh? Yeah, remember right now? When I\'m a frickin\' cyborg? Barry, just for you, I got explosive ammo.  You what now? Jesus Christ, you could have killed me! Shut up! Huh, I mean, I\'m not a doctor, or, a robotisist, but, uh, that can\'t be good.  So, hey, why don\'t we all do this   Oh, God.  Oh! Forgot what I was gonna say.  So, thank you For? Saving your life? I thought you were thanking me for dropping those truth bombs.  What? You\'ll never find a husband.  So, you really think he\'s dead? Only one way to be sure.  Hello? I\'m sorry, what? Shut up, no, uh uh.  No! What are you saying, Don? Sir, sir, over there.  Is that a man? Yeah, you\'re damn right it is.  Hey, but slow down, though, we\'re, hey  ! Jesus Christ, Arn.  Huh.  I think I got a blowjob out here once.  A what? I\'m sorry, did you say a blowjob? What? Yes! Of course it\'s off, Don! So, apparently, Don over served on vin rogue, and increasingly impatient for his bride to be\'s arrival at the rehearsal dinner, let Midge Olerud suck him off behind the sundae bar! Too soon? So thank you, Pamela, for ruining my wedding.  Oh, and also, my life.  You ruined my life! Are you happy? Yes.  All I wanted.Jeez, LaRue, can you believe this? A mandatory meeting at 7:00 A. M. ? Wonder what crawled up her butt.  Ugh, there\'s no telling.  Our bodies are aswarm with microscopic organisms, Pam.  Literally aswarm.  Wait.  What? What have you heard? About the staff meeting? Oh, right.  Yes.  Never mind.  Then may I suggest we get up there, so we don\'t have to find out what "grave consequences" means.  It means   In the context of her memo.  Jesus, what\'s up his butt? I think the important thing now is that we don\'t start any sort of panic.  Hurry up, ya ding dongs! Wait, wait, wait! I\'m coming! Hurry up.  Come on, come on, come on.  Oh, keep your panties on.  One step ahead of you.  Or am I? Wait.  Is Archer blowing this off? No.  Hold the door.  Hold the door! I am.  It\'s not doing anything.  Damn it, Ray, hold the frickin\' door! Oh, no! It\'s  maximum overdrive all over   Oh, good.  You made it.  Look, Ray, one is red and one is green.  What are you, color blind? I am, actually.  Typical.  Of what? So, does anybody have any idea what this meeting is about? Well, if I know Ms.  Archer, it\'s   Butt bugs.  What? Not what I was   Ugh! That was a figure of speech.  They all are! Hey, will you quit yelling? Will you? Yes! Hey! Remain calm.  Do not panic.  No one\'s panicking, Krieger.  Only because they haven\'t hatched yet.  Who? What hasn\'t hatched? What? Quit yelling! Krieger, what hasn\'t hatched? I\'ve said too much.  Krieger, I swear to   Oh, my God.  Remain calm.  Do not panic.  Krieger, shut up.  See? It\'s broken.  Ray? Archer? Hang on.  Ray, Cyril, give me a hand here.  Lana What? You   Should be doing this.  You know Oh, my God! We work in a coal mine? Carol, shut up.  You\'re not my coal mine supervisor! Yeah.  Hey, guys? Oh, damn it.  What? What is it? Well, thanks to Ray, who let\'s just all assume broke the elevator somehow, we\'re stuck at the top.  I hope.  Hello! Hello! Stop it.  No one else can hear you, because no one else is here yet.  Not that other people actually work here.  What do you mean? Where\'d they go? Remember when the office shut down, and we spent an entire year as coke dealers? What, so people just quit? And on the subject of things that don\'t work here anymore, my phone.  Uh, got nothing.  I am sans bars.  Yeah, you\'re not gonna get a signal.  I installed an R. F.  jammer on the roof.  Of the building? No, of the elevator.  Why? You did what? And for what possible reason? So people would quit staring at their phones and talk to each other.  Okay, well, then let\'s open the   One, two, three, go! Trap door! Ray, open the trap door.  He can\'t.  Wha   Oh, my God! Cyril, please.  I am way stronger than you.  That being said, this thing\'s stuck.  It\'s not stuck, it\'s locked from the outside.  Wait.  What? It\'s not for stranded passengers to get out, it\'s for rescue crews to get in.  The last thing they want is people crawling around on top of a malfunctioning elevator car.  Who is "they"? Big elevator.  Not a thing.  And why do you know so much about elevators? I don\'t know.  It\'s a hobby.  I guess I\'ve just always been fascinated by them.  I honestly have no response to that.  Anyway, I bet the top of the car smashed right into the motor, so   Yeesh.  Hope the radio jammer\'s okay.  Ow! Ow! Ow, ow! Ow! Thanks, Krieger.  I think we all needed that.  And besides, we don\'t need cell phones.  We have a   Elevator phone! Cyril, try that.  I am, if you\'d shut up.  Oh, gross! This phone is all sticky.  Yeah, mine at home gets bad sticky.  Ew.  Of course it does.  And since when are you elevator boss? Birth? And It\'s dead.  Typical.  Okay, Ray.  Interface.  I\'m sorry? With the controls.  Beep, boop, boop, boop! Come on, cyborg.  R2 D2 it.  "R2 D2 it. " Yeah, probe around in there and whatever.  Shut down the tractor beam.  With what, my dick? I   however you normally do it.  I don\'t normally do it! I know, but this is an emergency.  Hey! Hey! Damn it, Carol.  There\'s nobody   Shut up, stupid.  It\'s Milton! Go get help, boy.  There\'s no time! Go get help! Get help how? It\'s a toaster.  Well! Well, at the very least, maybe he\'ll bring back toast.  And speaking of toast, I don\'t know about you guys, but I didn\'t eat any Breakfast.  Hey, hey, wait a second.  Get your own goddamn bear claw! Cyril, what is that? Is that a bagel? No.  Get off.  Jeez, it\'s just napkins.  Guys, get the napkins! Okay, let\'s just take it down a n   Shut up! We\'re all gonna starve! Give me Get away! Guys, come on.  Knock it off, please.  Easy! Hey! Hey! Pam, stop that.  Everybody calm   Asshole! What the hell? I\'m sorry.  Seriously, I\'m sorry.  I sincerely apologize for doing that.  Archer, if you do that again   I swear to God I won\'t do it again.  Please don\'t.  You\'re listening for once.  That being said, I swear to God I will do it again.  Asshole.  Ray, shut up! Cyril, let\'s get that sweater vest off, buddy.  I\'m sorry? I know, but nobody makes you wear them.  I   why do you want it? As, like, a tablecloth or whatever.  We\'re all gonna put our food and drink in the middle, and then I\'ll be in charge of rationing it out.  No.  Why do you think you would be in charge? Because I\'ve been lost at sea.  What? I was lost at sea, Lana, and we had to ration the food and water.  Well, we should have.  I actually ate it all while the other guy was asleep.  Why would you tell us that story? If anything, that proves my point.  People like me are exactly why we have to ration our food and water.  People like you, who? The strong, like me and you and Pam, who will naturally prey on the weak, like the rest of them.  Maybe we should pool it together.  We don\'t know how long we\'re gonna be in here.  Yeah, give it up, weakie.  Pam, shut up.  I\'ll start.  Here\'smaybe six ounces of Bourbon.  If Cyril would hurry it up already! For the love of God, will you just   Okay.  Wait a minute.  How exactly is this supposed to work? It puts the vest on the floor! We put food and drink on the vest! Yeah, but where on the floor? There\'s no room.  It\'ll get kicked over.  Okay, so we tie the vest into, like, a pouch, and   For God\'s sake, man, it has no sleeves.  Plus the food\'ll just fall out the neckhole.  Well, then it\'s official.  The sweater vest is literally good for nothing.  Hey, you know what? Besides how to dress like an adult? Well, that\'s the only thing you do like an adult.  Burn! Yeah.  Total burn.  I hope I don\'t start crying later when I\'m driving an automobile to or from a bar! After having sex with a prostitute.  Which is the most adult thing a person could possibly do! I like him in vests.  Me too.  Yeah.  It works for him.  Well, thanks, ladies.  That\'s   No.  No.  Shut up.  I need to think.  About what? Look, this isn\'t that hard, people.  We\'ve got a bagel, four coffees, a quart of beer   A quart? This a fawty, shawty! Thanks, Omar.  And on top of that, we\'ve got, I\'m guessing, two flasks of bourbon.  I didn\'t know if I\'d have time for lunch.  And, Krieger? Coffee? Uh, no.  Tea? No.  What is it, soup? Define "soup. " Oh, good lord! Would it be safe to say nobody here wants to eat what\'s in your thermos? Sweet Jesus God, I would hope so! Okay, so how about we all agree to hold on to our food and drinks for now, if for no other reason than   Pam! Pam! Come on! Pam, stop it! Oh, God! That wasn\'t just bear claw.  What did you eat for breakfast? Linguine and clam sauce.  Oh, God! What, did you wake up on the docks? But I don\'t know about those clams, though.  As I was saying, before you, Pam, drank a third of a gallon of malt liquor, maybe we shouldn\'t eat or drink too much, because   Yes, Pam? I have to pee.  Come on! Of course you do.  You just drank a 40! That\'s what I was trying to say.  I\'m not a frickin\' mind reader.  Yeah.  In her defense, you didn\'t finish.  Yeah.  Pam, shut up.  I have an idea! Okay.  Wait.  Does it have anything to do with our current situation? Yes.  Okay, what is it? We are stuck in an elevator.  The idea, not our current situation.  Well, I\'m not a frickin\' mind reader! Oh, my God, what if I am? Then I guess you\'d know what we\'re all thinking right this very minute.  Okay.  You want a drink, you want to lecture us, you want more bear claws, you want to smoke, you want to masturbate, and you\'re scared that we\'ll figure out you\'re actually just a Krieger clone.  What? That\'s   That\'s all just common sense.  How is it common sense that she thinks I want to masturbate? Come on, Cyril.  For most of us, she just rattled off our obvious addictions.  I\'m not addicted to lecturing people.  Oh, come on.  That\'s All right.  And what are you laughing at, stroker ace? I\'m not addicted to masturbating! Cyril, come on.  Hand on the Bible, lie detector, gun to your head, you don\'t want to masturbate right now? Well, not in this elevator.  Well, I want to drink, so And I want to smoke, so So Cyril ought to be able to jack it.  Pam, shut up.  Well, we tried.  And just where, exactly, were you hoping to smoke that cigarette? Magnum P. I. \'s house.  But since I\'m stuck in here with you people Hey! What the shit, woman? The shit is that I am breastfeeding, so you will not smoke in this elevator! You want to bet? Do you? They\'re both addicted to gambling.  And you\'re just a regular Sylvia Browne.  I also have extreme claustrophobia.  Psst, Cyril.  Try to rub one out.  I do not want to masturbate! Oh, for   Not even watching that? Hey! Guys, come on! Hey! Get your hands o   Aah.  I\'m serious.  I cannot stress this enough.  You do not want tinnitus.  How about cirrhosis? Probably not that either.  Now, then.  Carol, you had an idea? Are you a mind reader, too? No.  You told us that you had one.  What? Oh, right.  Yes.  We all jump up and down at the same time to unjam this stupid thing, and then it plummets down into the basement, and we boing into that giant spring at the bottom of the elevator shaft, and then are safe.  So, suicide pact.  An oldie but a goodie.  Should we vote? Who\'s in? Uh uh.  No.  No.  Not doing that.  No.  That works.  I\'ve heard about people doing that.  You just want an excuse to wet your pants.  I don\'t need an excuse.  Yeah, what is this, Soviet Russia? It   wait.  Are you seriously asking? I mean Krieger, what\'s the deal? Would that really work? Wha   you\'re asking the guy with a thermos full of human being soup? It\'s   that\'s not even   if   What is this, Soviet Russia? Right? Oh, my God.  Cyril, shut up.  You shut up! Krieger, would that work? Huh.  Maybe? Maybe? What do you mean, maybe? Look, first of all, there\'s no giant spring at the bottom.  It\'s a hydraulic buffer, but you don\'t want to be in the elevator when it slams into it.  No, but at the last second, you just jump up in the air.  How would you know when to jump? Because you\'d give me a lecture on it.  Burn! Ray! She burned her.  I know, but   No.  Shut up, because here\'s the thing   safety brakes.  That\'s actually what Elisha Otis invented.  Not the elevator itself, but the safety brakes to stop it.  It was too bad they couldn\'t stop diphtheria.  So wait.  Would the brakes stop us? Maybe? Ugh! Oh, my God! Come on! Look, I don\'t know if they were damaged in the crash.  Okay, but what\'s the worst case? Worst case is we die.  Impaled on your boner.  I do not have an erection! Well, maybe not now, but say you get a severe head injury on impact.  Boom! Priapism! Meanwhile, your bodies are smashing around in here like crash dummies, until, one at a time, you are each impaled on my priapic erection.  Yeah.  Like meat at a Brazilian steakhouse! Ugh, please don\'t talk about food.  Yeah, I am figuratively starving.  For meat or Cyril\'s priapism? Both.  I can\'t take it! I am smoking! Ray! Ow! Get your foot off my lighter! Ray, I am serious.  God damn it! I\'ll put my mouth right up next to the hole and blow into it.  Err! Fine, but   Wait a minute.  Well, then I\'m peeing.  Where? I think I can get it all back in here.  No, you can\'t! Wait a minute.  Everybody stop now.  What? Two things.  One, I really think we need to have a serious talk about getting phrasing back in the mix.  Let it go.  Fine.  Whatever.  No more phrasing.  What was thing two? Oh, nothing.

I thought the hole was bigger.  I mean Ugh, it\'s soaking wet down here Get it, get it, get it before it gets on me! With what? There\'s nothing to wipe it up with.  A ha! Maybe it is good for something.  Are you crazy? That\'s cashmere! Wh   oh, my God.  Sorry.  What, so it\'s non absorbent? Lana, it\'s cashmere.  There are rules.  I\'m sorry, Cyril.  I didn\'t know.  Aw, son of a bitch! What\'s wrong? Guess we can go ahead and use my suit pants.  You can just say "pants. " Pam wet your pants.  It\'s still basically everywhere! And if it gets on my suede boots   Okay! Jeez! Why aren\'t you wearing underwear? What? Serious shit, did red dawn happen and nobody told me about it? Ne tak li? There! Happy? No.  No.  Yes.  Yeah.  Hey, and over here, too, because if it gets on these boots, I will not be responsible for my actions.  Right? Isn\'t it just so liberating? Hey, what\'s Milton doing? What do you   He\'s making toast! I want to see! Well, too bad, I\'m in the hole! Stop torturing me! Stop torturing  me! Oh, for   Ray, take a picture of him! Where\'s my stupid phone? In Soviet Russia   Pam?   Toaster take picture of you.  Doesn\'t even make sense.  It makes perfect sense.  You don\'t make sense.  It totally does.  The K. G. B.  bugs your apartment.  They put a camera in   All right! Jesus Christ! Holy shit! What? I\'ve got a signal! Yeah, I got, like, half a bar! Call 911! Call 911! In Soviet Russia   Pam, stop it! Ser\'yezno.  Yeah, seriously.  911 operator.  What is your emergency? Hello! Can you hear me? Hello? I can barely hear you.  I\'m trapped in an elevator! I\'m sorry? You said you are trapped in an elevator? Wh   yes! Ma\'am, you have no call to get snippy with me! "Ma\'am. " And for the record, being stuck in an elevator is not an emergency.  So I suggest you call your super.  No, no, no, no! Oh, call her back and tell her Carol\'s got crippling claustrophobia.  Wait.  What? Oh, Jesus! God damn it! 911 operator.  What is your emergency? I\'m stuck in an elevator   Ma\'am, pranking 911 is a felony! I   I am blocking this number! No, no, no, no! "Ma\'am"! Oh, my God.  We need this, too.  We do kind of.  "Ma\'am. " Plus plus, you\'re covered in piss.  Ray! Ray, call Malory! Yes, call that person.  Yes, do that.  Wait.  Call who? Malory! I bet she\'s downstairs! She can call an elevator repair guy! Oh, yeah.  Shit.  Hang on.  Yeah, hang on! Ray? Hang on! I\'m saying hang on! Hang on! What are you, deaf? What are you, color blind? Whoa! Too soon.  Yeah, inappropes! She said, flapping her wildly unkempt vagina at her coworkers! Oh, please.  You\'ve all seen it! Wait.  Oh, my God, we actually have.  And yours.  What? Krieger hasn\'t! Well, maybe not in person   Bu bu bu bu bup! Stoptalking.  Everybody stop talking! Trying to make a phone call! No, no, no, no! I\'m not here.  Are you tired of constantly getting stuck in elevators? Do you wish there was a way to not keep constantly getting stuck in elevators? Well, friend, wish and be tired no longer   Oh, come on.  Typical.  Hmm.  What, in the name of God, do you people think you\'re doing? Was there not a staff meeting? Well, there was I blocked out the entire morning for us all to do a team building exercise together.  Team building? Again? You got the elevator stuck on purpose! Wait, what? What? What are you talking about? Trapping us in here likelike Like piss covered animals? This was the team building exercise.  What are you No, it wasn\'t! We were going to watch Vision Quest.  Huh!So, that bag is clothes.  That bag is diapers.  The cooler is breast milk,   which obviously needs to go in the   Where do you buy breast milk? You don\'t, Archer.  You Oh, my god, will you relax? Here.  Have a cold Wow.    So no beer?   Why would I bring beer? Because you don\'t want me drinking liquor? I don\'t want you drinking anything!   What, that\'s all for her?   I\'ll find a sitter.  Lana, relax.  I won\'t drink while you\'re gone.    I take this very seriously.    Well, or at least Woodhouse does.    Yeah, and if he was here   Wait.  What? Where is he?   Rehab.    Oh, seriously? I know.  At his age, it\'s like, why even bother?   Well?   I\'m kidding.  It\'s his annual three days off.  It\'s normally two, but I let him roll over one from last year.  Your largesse knows no bounds.    Well, it\'s not paid.    Ugh! Have you at least baby proofed this place? I don\'t think a baby can hurt anything.  No, not Ugh! I mean, like firearms, for instance.    Are they stored securely?   Yes.    I\'ll find a sitter.    Lana, go.  A. J. \'s in good hands.  I know what I\'m doing.  I\'ve read ten Baby sitters Club books.    Really?   Yeah.  I\'m totally a Kristy,   with maybe, like, a dash of Claudia.    Because I won\'t have my phone.    So when you realize you can\'t handle it   I won\'t.  But when you do please shut up this is the main number at the zen center.    And a staff member will come and find me.    In your stupid What is it, a wigwam?   It\'s a yurt.    Wow.  Even stupider.    Archer, I\'m serious.    Me too.  Paying to spend 24 hours sweating in a yurt is literally the dumbest thing you\'ve ever done.    Oh, I can think of a few more.    You\'re right.  Maybe this will help you shed some of your negative energy.    My ?   Have fun.  Say hi to your spirit animal.  Ugh! Okay.  I\'ll see you tomorrow night.  But I bet you call before then! I bet I won\'t.  Holy shit, I gotta wash that down.  See that, A. J. ? That was a teachable moment about a little thing called confidence.  And contrary to what you may have heard, you can never have too much of it.  Or bourbon.  Where\'s the bourbon? Okay, I gotta have some irish, or at least some scotch, or blended, or Jesus Christ, Woodhouse, stock the bar! Okay, here we go.  So we have Ugh, tequila and coffee liqueur.  All right.  So we can make I guess this will be a Black Mexican? What? No, that\'s not racist.  That\'s what it is.  If you added milk, it would be a white Mexican, but all we have is breast milk Eww, which would make it a Rusty krieger.  Oh! Oh, god.  Wow.  That is mierda.  And also between us, okay? Because your mom likes to worry, A. J. , but she doesn\'t need to, because when you\'re with me, kid, you\'re as safe as a bug in a   Archer! Help!   Please help! He\'s been shot! Oh, good.  For a second, I thought you were Lana.  Where\'s the goddamn first aid kit? Behind the bar.  And quit yelling.   Ow!    Why did you hit me?   \'Cause! Get your shit together! Get your shit together, man.    You\'re the one who\'s bleeding to death.    Yeah.  From my ears.  So shut up! Everybody shut up, because, spoiler alert, this is a baby.  And why do you have a baby? Well, Slater.  When a mommy and a daddy   love each other very much   In your apartment!   Yeah.  Or a motel or a porta john, or   Are you trying to piss me off?   Not really.    Well, you are, so Why do you keep your first aid kit in the bar? Because that\'s where over   Wow.  Really?   They happen in the bathroom! Not in my home.  Speaking of which, why are you in it, and who is he?   Sterling Archer, this is Farooq Ashkani.    Yeah.  Hi.    Black Mexican?   What? Uh, hey, dick, I happen to be Pakistani.  _ I was offering you a drink, but all I have is tequila and coffee liqueur.  Sorry.  I thought you were being racist.  No.  If anything, you were, if you think black or Mexican is an insult.    My child is actually multiracial, so   Hang on.  Go back.  You speak Urdu? Huh? Oh.  No.  No, no.  Just that one phrase.  The only phrase you know in Urdu is, "no, shit, you goat raping pig devil"? What? I thought it mean, "I\'m sorry. " Huh.  Probably why that night in a Karachi whorehouse suddenly went from pretty bad to much worse.  I\'m gonna stop you there.  Somebody should.  I mean, this is a baby.  Because time\'s a bit of a factor.  Until yesterday, Farooq was a cyberspy for Pakistani intelligence.  But now he wants to come over to our side.  Are we not on the same side?   Eh   Eh Anyway, I was walking him into a CIA safe house, but a bunch of his former colleagues were waiting for us.  I had to shoot our way out of there.  But how did they know where the Oh, my god, could the CIA have a leak? That\'s what I said! Anyway, until I find the leak and plug it, I need you to babysit him.  And I object to the term "babysit," because clearly I am not a baby.  And I\'m already babysitting what clearly is an actual baby, so   She sure is.  Can I hold her?   Uh, yeah.  Okay.    But, you know, be careful.    I got her.  There we go.    Archer, come on.    No.    24 hours.    No!   And a hundred grand.    Yes! Okay, good.  I\'ll call you after I deal with the leak, then you\'ll bring him to the new safe house.    And payment will be   By wire transfer.  Is that a problem? No.  I just didn\'t know if I should bring my sack   with the big dollar sign on it.    Just bring him.  And I need to borrow a shirt.    Farooq?   Um Why do you Never mind.  There\'s a logic to all of it.  Aw, you\'re absolutely insane.  Crazy son of Is he gone?   Yeah, he\'s   Because he\'s kind of a dick, right?   Right.    And what\'s the deal with that safe house? Am I right? Come on.  They should call it a Misnomer house.  But this place is safe, though, right?   Yeah, I mean   Yeah, I mean, it\'s the penthouse.  And I assume that\'s the only door, so Well, except for the terrace, but Yeah, so maybe we should lock that? Hey.  Shh.  Sorry.  I was just kind of freaking out, man.    I just saw a guy get shot.    Well, if you get her started again,   you\'re gonna see you get shot, so   Yeah, okay.    So you have guns here, right?   Yes.  I literally have tons of them.    Yeah, but   Hang on.  Not literally, but a lot.  Yeah.  Okay.  But on you, I mean, like Are you strapped? Am I strapped? No, homie, I\'m not.  Okay, so you don\'t have a gun on you, is what I\'m saying.  And "no" is what I\'m saying.    Okay, good.    Wh That\'s just gonna make this next part a lot easier.  Well, for me.  Oh, my god.  Okay.  Good stuff.    You had me going there for a second.    I\'m sorry? I can\'t believe Lana set this up.  Just so I\'d call and ask for help.  And you got Slater in on it? With the fake blood? Oh, man.  She is pathetic.  What the shit? You shot me!   I wanted your full attention.    Well, you nailed it, asshole! Jesus Christ! Did Lana pay you extra too shoot me? Okay, I don\'t know this Lana, but   I\'m sorry?   Yeah.  Me too.  She sounds like a real practical joker.  But I assure you, Mr.  Archer, this is all very real.  Hey, hey, now, listen to me, all right? Listen.  I don\'t know what\'s going on,   but you\'re gonna hand me the baby.    No, Mr.  Archer, I am not.  Not until you take me to your headquarters so I can access the mainframe computer.  Yeah, I heard you, but I\'m not going anywhere   until you put it up there.    Fine.  Whatever.  Wow! You drive like a gaping dickhole.  So I guess there\'s no CIA leak.  Nope.  My follow team created a diversion so that Slater would bring me to you, so that you would bring me here.    Just don\'t hurt her.    Well, I hope it won\'t come to that.    You really, really should.    Just make sure there are no surpris God damn it!   What the   It\'s Friday night.    Why the hell are people still here?   I don\'t know.  I guess it\'s Jeezy petes! An inside straight? Got three on the hip, I need four for the weekend.    I\'m going to Hotlanta.    Have fun, I hope you get hate crimed.  Hey, whoa!   Goddamn, woman.    Seriously.  I\'ll hate crime your ass right here.    You know what?   Guys, come on.  Can\'t we have one poker night without a hate crime? Okay, A: the thing last month wasn\'t a hate crime Because I will straight flush your brains out the back of your skull!   It was just a regular crime.    And obviously now I put my gun in the time lock safe until the game\'s over.  And so basically, the only thing keeping you from murdering each other is a lack of access to firearms.    Works for Canada.    Nothing works for Canada.  Hey guys Is Are you playing strip poker? No.    It just gets hot as balls in here.    Literally.    Okay, well   Hang on! Yeah, literally.    Right, I just came by because, uh   Aha! Because you need help with the baby and you can\'t call Lana,   so you came to ask one of us for help.    For your information, Cyril, I don\'t need help with A. J.  because I, uh Hired a manny.  Hey, I\'m Manny.    Black Mexican?   No, thank you, I probably shouldn\'t.    Shouldn\'t what?   Uh, swarm across the Rio Grande?   From Pakistan?   Where\'s Woodhouse? My guess, Avenue D.  Anyhoo, we just, um, gotta grab Some baby stuff.  So, we\'re gonna go do that.  Manny? Good luck with your hate cards? Pff, go back to Canada, Guy Lafleur.  Okay, ante up, ya goat raping pig devils!   Nothing wild but the dealer.    Hang on a sec.  Did Archer seem a little, like scared to you guys? What? Ya know, now that you mention it, he did actually seem a little nervous.  I bet he\'s just on the C. D. L.    The what?   Canadian down low.  Please, like you all wouldn\'t bang Alan Thicke   if you had the chance.    I think we should go check it out.    Well, if we\'re not gonna play poker!   I thought this was ouija.  So, those guys Kinda dicks, right?   Right?   Totally.  Okay, now enter the command sequence string.  Okay good, now once you\'ve entered that wow, still working on it.  You also type like a gaping dickhole.  Sorry, I don\'t wanna mess up.  Man, you are nothing like your file.  All these stories about what a badass you are, but I gotta tell ya, Farooq\'s not seeing it.  Well, in those stories, I\'m probably not changing poopy diapers, so So do you seriously not even care   what I\'m doing with your mainframe?   I honestly don\'t.  Okay, I\'m going to tell you anyway.  I\'m using it to backdoor my state of the art spyware into the CIA network, so Pakistani intelligence will know everything they do in real time.  And why are you telling me this?   I\'m  Wait, what?   I mean, now I\'m just gonna tell the CIA,   and they\'ll find the spyware.    That was only one of many, many   possible things I could be doing.    Okay.  No, no, and the very fact that I told you that\'s what I\'m doing, I mean that was   clearly misdirection, right?   Okay.  Plus, I doubt you\'ll be talking very much after I shoot you in the face.  Take it easy, I Shit! I don\'t have a will!   I\'m a notary!   Wha? What the shit, Manny? Pam! Baby! What the heck\'s going on in   Well, ya don\'t see that everyday.    I didn\'t even see it today Wait, wait, wait, wait! So, here\'s the thing, Farooq.  I don\'t know about any stories, but whatever badass shit that you heard I did, you really need some context, because pretty much my whole life, pretty much right up until this minute, my default setting has been "half ass. " But that was before I had a child, a child you threatened to harm.  A child, I just realized, who\'s probably on her way up to the roof so Aunt Pam can swat at biplanes.  Wait, what the hell am I doing? The roof\'s the first place they\'ll look.  So imagine, as I literally beat you to death Hang on.  Yeah, literally, that a giant hand has turned my dial from "half ass" to "quadruple ass. "   Wow.  That is a lot of ass.    Yeah, basically eight times the ass.  Can I just say one thing, before we get into all   the beating to death?   What? I still have a gun? Oh, right.   Well? What\'s going on in there?  Okay, so that lesbian au pair has a gun.  I think she\'s robbing Mr.  Archer.    Wait, what?   What au pair?   The black Mexican.    Oh for So what should we do? Nothing! Until we consult the ouija.  God I love poker night.  So, before you shoot me, can I just say one thing? What? What the shit, Cyril? Really? Take cover! C\'mon, Cyril.  There\'s other desks.    This one\'s good.    Ow.  Damn it! This is exactly how Brett died.  Man, I wish he was still with us.  He could soak up some of these bullets.  God, finally.  Okay, that\'s eight rounds, including the one in my shoulder, so he\'s   Reloading!   God dammit.  Oh! Ray, gun.    It\'s in a time lock safe.    What? Why? Because Cheryl.  I\'m calling for backup! _   What\'d he say?   Well, my Urdu isn\'t as strong as I thought.  _ Meh.  But I\'m gonna assume he just called for backup.  So we gotta get to the armory.    It\'s empty.    It\'s What do you mean, it\'s empty?   When we got shut down, that guy   Kevin.  Kyle? Keith? Kenny? Kieran.    Rodney?   Rodney! Why was I thinking Kev He stole everything! He set himself up in Europe as some kind of arms dealer.  Gentlemen, I\'m afraid you mistake my hospitality for weakness.  The price is the price.  If you wish to negotiate, you may do so with my associates.  And apparently he\'s doing quite well.   Reloading! Remind me, if this asshole doesn\'t kill all of you,   to do it for him.    Uh, no.    And take that ridiculous thing off.    Make me.    Ow, stop it, cut it out, stop, ow!   Wait a minute.    Ow!   Gimme that.  Okay, on my signal, I\'m gonna draw his fire.  You idiots make make a run for it, find Pam and A. J. , and get them to safety before the rest of these jerk dicks get here.    What about Cheryl?   Who cares? No, I\'m genuinely asking.  So while we\'re getting A. J.  out of here, what\'re you gonna be doing? Krieger, the HVAC ducts are still chock full of nerve gas, right?   Wait, what?   Yeah, but But shut up, just get A. J.  outta here, I\'ll take care of the rest.    Archer, that\'s   Pretty heroic, I know.    I was gonna say overkill, but   What\'re you, on their side? That asshole threatened to hurt A. J. ! Although now that I think about it, this whole thing is totally her fault.  What? As far as field operations are concerned, she\'s a huge liability! Now shut up and wait for my signal.  Reloading.  I should probably stop saying that out loud.    Should we just go now?   I mean, yeah you should have, but it\'s probably too late now, so Now! _ Quit saying that! We should\'ve gone then, I bet.  _ Where do you think you\'re going? Must protect baby.  What the? Not bad.  I\'m gonna give you a seven.    Wait, what?   Me, or him?   No him, Slater said you were great.    Aww, he\'s sweet.  You, I took off a point because Pam was feeding A. J.  Vienna sausages.  Idiot! She\'s not on solid food yet.    They weren\'t solid.    The fact that you were pre chewing them and spitting them into her mouth What the hell is going on? Shhhh.  What is wrong with you?   Well for starters, I got shot.  Twice.    Where did you get a real gun? My cousin.  The one you gave me looked like, so fake, and I thought a real one would help me get into the character better.  Oh, give it a rest, James Lipton.    He\'s an actor?!   Well, mostly improv, but You set this whole thing up? You had me shot?   You had Slater shot?   No, the CIA guys did his make up.  Looked pretty real though, huh?   So cool.    Were you assholes in on this? Oh, please, you can\'t tell them anything.  Why would you do this?! I wanted to see if I could trust you to take care of A. J.  by yourself.  Oh! Yeah, let\'s talk about trust! Oh, let\'s talk about drinking a gallon of black Mexicans before driving around in a car with your infant daughter!   Good point   I was at gunpoint!   Also good.    Well you still lied when you said you weren\'t gonna drink.  You knew I was lying.  That doesn\'t ex Wait, that\'s your excuse? Yes! Lana.  Now, if you\'ll excuse me, I am in fairly desperate need of medical attention.  All your fault! God damn it! Why are you going up? All right, I\'d call this a qualified success.    Yeah, I really feel like I nailed it.    So you do improv, huh? Yeah, at Dream the improovable dream, down on Twenty third and Lex.  You guys gotta come down, ya know, maybe take a class, it\'s good for confidence, or just, at least come out to a show Here\'s some flyers.  Our upcoming shows are on there, plus there\'s a coupon for a free drink if you\'re a lady, so Wait, is it not the Imprahv able dream? Huh.  That makes way more sense.What? Ugh, yes I\'ll accept the charges.  Goddamn, who is it? Cancer? I think it\'s Mr.  Archer.  Hello? Carol, hey, shut up.  I need your help.  And that\'s how you ask? Wait, Pam? Is that you?   Yes.     Great, shut up, because I\'m talking to Carol, and Carol, here\'s the deal   let me guess.  You\'re all butt hurt because Lana hired some Pakistani dude to shoot you, so you went to Vegas, and now you\'re drunk and broke outside a casino, and you want me to wire a thousand dollars to buy you a plane ticket and a pre flight whore.  Okay, I\'m gonna list everything you just said that\'s totally wrong.  A Not outside a casino, so Okay, it\'s gonna sound like I\'m hanging up? But   No.  No.  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait! C\'mon, I really need your help.  Okay, where do I send the   Hang on! Make him beg! Pam, goddamn it, I said shut up! You shut up! Jesus, I\'m sending you the money for your stupid plane ticket! Which would be great If I were not on the no fly list.  How did you get on the no fly list? Uh Help! Get it off! I wanna fly the plane! You know, who knows? It\'s the government.  That\'s not important   What is important is getting me home.  Ugh, fine, then I\'ll send money for a stupid train ticket.  Which would also be great I wanna fly the train! Wow, I had no idea there was a "no train" list.  Well, neither did I, but apparently there is, and before you ask, the answer is no, Carol.  A thousand times no.  I will not   I cannot ride the bus.  Wh  ? Stop! Goddamn it, I said no! Simone, I swear to God, I will rub your own remaining teeth in your eyes! You ain\'t got So.  I don\'t care what it costs me, financially or self respectfully, but I need you to do me a big favor.  Oh, thank you! Thank you, God! Yay! Right? Archer, you look like shit.  And   And obviously thank you, too.  Asmodeus, destroyer of men.  All I needed was an airplane! So why is it full of you idiots? I wasn\'t going to sit around the office all by myself! Because one of us needed some multi engine time for his pilot\'s license   And one of us would go pretty much anywhere to piss off your mother.  Hello.  Hello? Son of a Fine! Then I\'ll just get my own ice! No.  I\'ll drink it neat.  And me and Krieger are all about going to Branson! Booyah! And I assume Branson is some sort of all one cares to eat establishment? You\'re kidding, right? Say what? It\'s only the biggest country music tourist destination in the world! Wait a minute, is this about Cherlene? Who? She has no memory of any of that.  Wait, what? You don\'t remember being the number one country singer in America? Pfff, okay Besides, Branson isn\'t just country music! There\'s Tony Orlando, Charo   the comedy stylings of Yakov Smirnoff! How do you not know about Branson? I guess the same reason I don\'t know what grits are, or hush puppies! Are you serious? Oh, my God.  Hush puppies are little balls of fried cornmeal batter.  Mm.  Not really, though.  Well, and also shoes.  Well thank you, Cyril.  I was just angry, now I\'m confused and angry.  Good morning, ladies and gentlemen.  This is captain Ray Gillette, welcoming you aboard from the flight deck.  Flight time to Branson is about three hours.  No it isn\'t! Shut up! And in the meantime, if you look out the left side of the cabin   you can just make out Nellis Air Force base, home to Area 51! Wait, what? Seriously? Hey, watch it! Ow! Man, I can\'t see it! See what? What\'s Area 51? What\'s Area   Are you shitting me? Everybody knows about Area 51! Yeah, even me, and I didn\'t even know they made shoes out of cornbread.  It\'s where the government keeps all the aliens that have crashed on earth.  Well, allegedly, but   Oh, my God.  Cyril, shut up.  Oh, so you believe the United States government is actually harboring extra terrestrial life forms at an air force base in the Nevada desert.  No.  Ray! Get in closer, I can\'t see jack dick! No, this is good.  That airspace is all extremely restricted, so     Oh come on, you pussy!   For the love of God, man! Well, maybe a little closer.  Whoa, hang on, what\'re you doing? And what are you wearing? It was in the crew locker.  I think it looks pretty sharp.    Really?   Ray, get closer!   Pam, shut up!   Make her!   Look, Ray, I know you don\'t do well with peer pressure     Wha a a aa? Teacup pig.  Oh.  Yeah.  And how big was Li\'l Hamlet when you finally had to get rid of him? He was up there.  Yeah.  Like three hundred shit covered pounds.  But seriously, Ray.  Don\'t dick around with the air force.  That\'s a top secret base down there and they\'ve got surface to air missiles, so    Ray! Pam! Ray? Krieger! Ra ay! What? God   Damn it! What? That.  Goddamn it.  Everybody hang on! God damn it! I said, hang on.  Ya know Jesus Christ, Ray, do something! Besides fly the goddamn plane? Oh, you\'re already   sorry, I didn\'t know what the deal was, if you   I think I can land it! But I gotta put it down at Nellis! Where the missiles are coming from? It\'s either that or frickin\' crash! Okay, sorry, just making sure there\'s not a third option we haven\'t   Get out! Are we gonna die? Not today, gorgeous, not today.  I mean, probably today, but   Krieger! Everybody! Calm down! Ray says he can land us at Nellis! You mean right at Area 51? Yes, Pam! Happy? I mean yes? But who needs ice? It\'s perfectly fine without ice.  Just ask Europe.  Lana? No? Come in dear, what\'re you doing? Come in here.  Hello! Hello dear, drink? Uh, no? Well, you\'re not missing much.  No ice.  Not a cube.  And I can\'t wait to hear her flimsy excuse this time.  Get out the plane! Put your hands up! Get out of the plane now! Let\'s go, let\'s move! Wow, those guys look furious.  Yeah, no shit! So thank you, Ray! For what, safely landing the plane? What, like that cancels out getting it shot down in the first place? You were the one yapping your damn head off about my damn teacup pig! Who I hope to see on my next BLT! Well too bad, because he went to live on a A farm! Exactly! So unless that farm had a magical talking spider   Yeah, they don\'t keep \'em around for their milk.  And I don\'t know that we\'re accomplishing as much as we could be right now.  Hmm.  How about now? Oh my God, I bet it\'s nerve gas! Just like they sprayed on Duddy Kravitz in "Close Encounters"! Wait, what? It\'s not nerve gas, you idiots, it\'s   You think the CIA\'s above nerve gas? I   holy shit, that\'s right, it\'s the CIA! I\'ve got Q clearance! Wait, what? What does that even mean? It means get naked.  C\'mon, let\'s go.  Gun\'s out, buns out.  Don\'t shoot! Hands up, everybody! We\'re coming out! Don\'t shoot! Do not shoot! Guys, it\'s okay, I   He\'s got a weapon! He\'s got a weapon! Gun! Q clearance! I\'ve got Q clearance! Seriously, is that even a real thing? Q clearance? We\'ll see about that.  What\'s your authentication phrase? Sweet dash forty four, tender dash nine, hot dash juicy pork chops! I didn\'t pick it.  Authentication checks out, sir.  Says here he\'s Agent Slater.  Hmph! Well, Agent Slater! What? Who? Agent Slater.  Shut up.  How\'d you get Slater\'s codeword? You mind telling me why in God\'s green dick you were in my airspace? Well, our airspace, for starters, right? Since I have CIA clearance and all.  And not that it\'s any of your business, lieutenant Colonel.  Lieutenant Colonel, but during transport of these prisoners   black site, pretty icky stuff.  They attempted to overpower me, forcing my pilot to make an emergency landing, but before he could radio your tower for permission to land, boom! And then   well, you know the rest.  Is this true? Uh   He\'s Israeli! So, just Hebrew.  Unless Reds Yiddish? Nisht? So no, just Hebrew.  Then how was he gonna radio the tower? Which, I mean   yeah, exactly, and if I spoke Hebrew I would ask him.    Well     R right after I ask your wife and kids about you, but they don\'t know, they haven\'t seen you in a year.  They think you ran off with a stripper, when in reality you are literally climbing the walls of a farmhouse in Virginia somewhere, out of your mind on LSD, compliments of the CIA and MK Ultra.  Jesus Christ So while you\'re finding me a new airplane, Air Force guy, we\'re gonna need some sort of shuttle to I assume you have an officer\'s club? Yep.  Jeeps! Gimme two jeeps up here, on the double! Jeeps, goddamn it, jeeps! Shisn tsvey hozn mit eyn shos.  I\'m sorry? You\'re sure you don\'t want a drink? Yeah, in the low nineties on that.  Suit yourself.  So.  And how is our little Abbiejean? Oh, yeah she\'s good, great actually, and I\'m really liking her nanny.  Mm.  Hispanic? She\'s actually Polish.  Is that supposed to be better? What? No.  They\'re both   Abbiejean.  That\'s from where, again? Again, it was my grandmother\'s name.  Hmm.  You know what I think would be wonderful? A border moat? Is if she had her grandmother\'s name.  Well yeah, and obviously I talked to my mother of god, you mean you.  Thoughts? Because they don\'t have my brands, I don\'t even recognize most of these.  Well, maybe instead of worrying about what cocktails to make   That\'s what I\'m saying, Cyril.  I don\'t even know if I can make cocktails! What the hell\'s the air force spending all those kajillions of dollars on? O\'Dublin tequila? I mean vodka, maybe.  They obviously know their way around a potato, but   My point is maybe you should worry about what\'s gonna happen to us when they find out you\'re not Slater! Cyril, I should worry about all kinds of shit.  But you know what they say about stress.  C\'mon, anybody? Exactly, the silent killer.  What? What is wrong with you? Jesus, use your talking words! Just slap her.  Ho, ho, ho, holy shitsnacks! Did you guys see that? What are you talking about? It was, it it it   Just slap him.  C\'mon! Uhh! Where are you going? Oh! Goddamn it.  Ya think? Yeah, it\'s worse than I thought.  We might even have to use sour mix.  I am talking about Pam and Krieger running around a top secret military installation in their underwear! When they\'re supposed to be prisoners! Yeah that\'s no good, huh? They\'ll probably shoot them on sight.  Well? Well what, Cyril? Yes, obviously I\'m gonna go after them So just calm down, do something with your hands.  Cut some limes.  Security breach, sector nine.  No, but seriously, Cyril.  Cut some limes.  Like, six.  Security breach.  Sector nine.  You think that\'s for us? I don\'t know.  What sector is this? What am I, this map? Oh wait.  Aw crap, this is totally nine! Eh, could be a coincidence.  Yeah, like just a fire drill.  Although it\'s probably because they found that poor kid you clobbered.  You don\'t think I killed him, do ya? What am I, a doctor? Ouch.  So, guess Pam came through here.  Jesus, it\'s like tracking a bear.  Wait, you\'re breathing though, right? Attaboy, shake it off.  Bet you probably just have brain   Freeze! Hey, guys.  Drop it! I said drop it! It was empty anyway.  The weapon! Drop the weapon! What, on the floor? Are you serious? So hey, you may not know this, since I assume you get yours for free, but guns are actually pretty expensive   I\'m gonna count to three! Look, count to whatever you want.  A hundred thousand.  Mm hm.  Dollars.  Mm.  To name my kid after you? I think it\'s quite generous.  I think it\'s quite batshit insane! Well, I   and Ron can afford it and   I\'m not selling you the naming rights, Malory! She\'s not a frickin\' bowl game! Oh now I mean, if it means that much to you   I guess maybe Malory could be her middle name? Really? Yes.  Well, obviously that\'s not worth a hundred thousand dollars, but   Fifty? Pff! of the revised birth certificate on my desk by Friday.  I   Oh, and christen her in a white church, and I\'ll kick in five more.  Wow.  Real life E. T. \'s! My God, I hope we find them.  I have so many questions! Pff, like what, how to build a better anal probe? Right? I bet their anal technology is light years ahead of mine.  A light year\'s a unit of length, dipshit.  Well, whatever then Parsecs.  Length.  I   hey ya know what? I know how far light travels in vacuum in a Julian year.  Ooooh! Very good, Pamela.  I, that, my, I   you know my name? Yes, Pamela.  And yours, Algernop.  But, but, but but but but   English? Yeah, head.  Head.  Pam! I think he means telepathy.  Holy shit, like in scanners? No.  No no no, wait! I have Q clearance! Bullshit.  Firing in three! Two! No! Stop it! Look, I\'m serious.  Just radio Lieutenant Colonel.  He can straighten this whole thing out! Lieutenant Colonel who? What? Lieutenant Colonel who.  Oh, my God! Wow, all right, this is pretty embarrassing.  I thought that guy was a lieutenant, and that his last name was Colonel.  In three! Two! Wait! Goddamn it, look, I was just trying to get home from Vegas.  So okay, here, you can have my weapon.  But I do have some conditions.  Uh, what conditions? Well you\'re not gonna like \'em.  Whew! And not to knock the air force, but good thing you guys have airplanes.  I got a cousin in the Air Force.  Brian.  I should give him a call.  Should we, uh Guys, I really feel like we should be doing something.    Ugh, we are   C\'mon, nothing by the drifters? The tams? The dominoes? The embers? They call this "Classic Rock. " Pff, what is this, Myrtle Beach? Ray.  Is this Myrtle Beach? No.  And that, my dear earthlings, is the key to understanding the entire universe.  Well, at least as we understand it.  Yes.  Ta take us with you! I will, if you shut up! What the hell, Krieger, did you shove your dick in a socket? Did did   ow! Krieger, I am in no mood.  Now, get dressed.  Ugh, seriously? Yes, seriously.  We\'re gonna walk out of this building, into a hangar, and steal an Air Force plane! And while we\'re doing that, I could do with a whole lot less shit from you, Since all I wanted was a ride home! On my private jet.  Wh  ? Yes! Can, can can we talk for a second? About what happened? Uh, is that before or after Krieger sexually assaulted a two twenty outlet? "Area 51".  No! You guys! I swear, they were   Pam! Seriously, get your shit together.  We have to go steal a plane from the United States Air Force.  Which not as hard as I would\'ve thought.  Ray!  Wie geht\'s? Pff, darf min gehn in kolledj? Yeah? You guys good? If you want a drink, just   wh  ? Because it\'s just de icing fluid and Tang.  Tell me! Tell me you saw them! I   Pam, I saw a blinding white flash, that\'s it.  No E. T. , no Alf B but you believe me, don\'t you? You believe I\'m telling the truth! Pam, the truth is out there.  So you do believe me? No! You stupid idiot! Alrighty then! I think I\'m sufficiently drunk enough, so so who\'s up for Branson? Realsies, realsies? Yeah! This thing have bombs on it?No, I just wanna make sure we\'re both totally clear about this.  Yes, Lana, you\'ve made it totally, very nearly insultingly, clear.  Because this is only my parents meeting their grandchild.  And oh, by the way this is her father.  Yeah, it\'s   It\'s not "meet my boyfriend," it\'s not, "meet my future husband. " Nobody\'s guessing who\'s coming to dinner.  Totally clearly insulting.  So, just to be clear, we\'re clear? Oh, my God.  Oh, my God! Hey! Shut up! Sir, is there a problem here? Yes! Where the hell have you been? Here.  And if you want to save yourself some trips, let\'s uh, make it a pitcher.  Uh, we don\'t even have pitchers.  Well, then, I don\'t know what to tell you.  Maybe rinse out a little trash can.  Also, my parents aren\'t big drinkers? Yeah, they\'re like huge nerds, right? Uh, no.  They\'re academics! "Tomato, Tomato. " My mom, Claudette, is a professor of public policy at U. C.  Berkeley, with a focus on feminist issues.  Yikes.  Glad I didn\'t waste suitcase space on that barrel of monkeys.  Shut up.  And my father, Lemuel, is a microbiologist   who might be up for the Nobel Prize.  Holy shit.  Yeah, right? Right! What happened to you? Oh, and one more, like, "tiny thing. " Swear to God.  Last one till dinner.  Not that.  Although what the shit? I\'m actually kinda nervous.  Ugh.  Me too, actually, because my parents think I\'m still working on my PhD at Columbia.  In environmental science.  What? They don\'t know you\'re a spy? No! And if you tell them I am, I will literally murder you   wait   in front of our very own infant child.  So, serious up, because they\'re not crazy about this whole arrangement, so   Serious up.  Lana, once I meet them, I\'m sure they\'ll find me utterly charming.  You  have  met them.  Yes, he\'s getting his master\'s, too, and he\'s nice   and I said that already, and I\'m sure he\'s just caught in traffic.  Hmm.  He could have walked here by now.  If it\'s gonna be that  kind of party, etcetera, etcetera   mashed potatoes! Oh, whoo! Oh, did they find me utterly charming? Hey! Hi! Oh.  Look who\'s here! Let me have my grandbaby! Uh   and, um, you remember Archer? Yes, of course.  We\'ve got the mashed potatoes just the way you like \'em   Oh, Lana.  You have made a beautiful baby.  Well, we sort of both   would agree with that statement.  Lana can speak for herself.  Yup.  So? Any news? Um I had a baby? Oh, honey, I\'m talking about your studies.  Yes, Lana.  When on Earth are you planning to finish your dissertation? Yeah, Lana.  Don\'t do that Nope.  because you\'re taking your time as well.  What is it you\'re studying? Umm Medieval Slavic History.  Really? Well, that must be fascinating! Well, everybody thinks that, but   So, tell me: what are your thoughts on the Battle of Kosovo of 1389? No opinion.  Well, not even as it applies to the rise of modern Serbian nationalism? Mm nope.  Also, that\'s a bit reductionist.  But enough about you.  Am I right? Daddy, tell us about your research.  Well, algae is always challenging! Yeah.  Just ask a flip flop.  Don\'t do that.  Nope.  His research is going extremely well.  And, in the near future, you may be spending a lot less time and money at gas stations.  You\'re buying us motorcycles? No! Daddy\'s been working on   Lana.  Mom, it\'s fine.  Archer is, um   Lana, it\'s okay, you can say "family. " I   Well, I thought I could, but I honestly don\'t know if I can.  Wow! Great, now you\'ve made the baby cry.  That was you! Lana, here, take the child.  I\'m not sure which end needs attention, but while you check on that, your father and I will check on dinner.  And I will check on that hot tub.  Seriously? Are you frickin\' serious? Um yes.    Oh, my God!   Dammit, Krieger! So, now we gotta forfeit league night? How the hell did you run out of gas? Yeah, especially in   where even are we? Mm Brownsville? Hey, whoa.  It may be a bit rundown, but there\'s no need to be racist.  No, not because of African Americans.  Brownsville\'s just the name, dip nuts.  Yeah, which doesn\'t really make sense because this all used to be Jewtown.  Whoa, not cool, dude.  Oh, please, you people invented racism.  Also you\'re just a reconstructed light field, produced by firing a laser through a beam splitter.  Whoa! Yeah, dude, not cool.  Hot! Hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot How is it? Oh, it is hot, Lem.  Can I call you Lem? Of course you may, absolutely, but it\'s actually pronounced Doctor Kane.  Ah.  Ah   Mm Ah Hm.  Well, Lana\'s feeding the baby.  How is it? Hot.  Actually almost too hot, now that you, um   I\'m actually gonna hop out, so   Nonsense.  You stay right there.  Uh huh   Mm Isn\'t this just so relaxing? Is it? Well, nudity is our natural state.  He\'s not nude.  What? Then why are you in here? I was just asking myself the same   That\'s ridiculous, you have to be naked.  Otherwise it\'s pointless.  Is it? Trunks, young man, trunks.  Um \'kay There, now that\'s not so hard, is it? So, do you guys do phrasing, or? And now that we\'re all skyclad, as they say, we have something very special we\'d like to share with you.  Wait, what? But just between us three, there\'s no reason to tell Lana about it.  No, she might not approve.  Oh, God Okay, but just so you know, I\'ve never worn a condom, ever, and Lem, obviously the implicit agreement between you and I, is that at no time will our penises touch, but I\'d also appreciate it if you didn\'t make eye contact, you know with me during Did I misread th   I   No.  No.  You do not talk.  In fact, first thing tomorrow, you\'re going to the vet to have your vocal chords clipped.  How about just put to sleep? Because who gets in a hot tub naked with an almost complete stranger? Because everybody! Because Berkeley! That\'s   how does an entire city get a pass on acceptable behavior? Acceptable behavior? This, from the man who just tried to have a threesome with me and my wife? I was being polite! Wh  ? How is that polite? Because I thought that\'s what they wanted! They said they wanted to share a special secret with me, so   Wait, what special secret? What? Why is he even still here? Daddy Look, the man\'s an ass bucket.  What the  ? Hey don\'t look at me, I\'m not   The baby! Oh, shit!   Oh, dear God   Mom? Claudette? I\'m in here, in the study! Where\'s A. J. ? She\'s fine, she\'s upstairs, but   What the hell happened? Oh, my God my research! All my research my data, my notes! All my samples! All my years of work! It\'s all gone! Why would anybody want mildew? Algae! Oh, my God, are you shitting me? With a baby in the house? Why do you have a gun? What, seriously? For this.  Great.  Lana, what is the meaning of this? Why does he have a gun? Okay, so   Whoa, whoa, whoa   C\'mon, are we not even gonna address how amazing that shot was? Not now, Archer, I\'m   Shit.  Yeah, so listen, if you wanna catch those guys and get your mildew back   It\'s algae.  Yeah, take that tone.  You got a car? What? Yes, but, but, but   Get your shit together, Lem! Be a lamb and watch the baby? Lana, this is all just crazy, why does he have a gun? And why is he driving? I should be driving! No, Daddy, Archer should drive.  He\'s actually pretty great at it.  When he\'s not busy ejaculating.  Not in my Mustang, you don\'t! But, seriously, what\'s wrong with him? Guys, this is, this is the   the car from   Bullitt,  we know, and if you\'d go already, maybe later I\'ll dress up like Steve McQueen for you! Ew, that\'s not even what it\'s about.  Plus your hands are too big.  Go! But speaking of McQueen, if there was ever a time to wear the Tactleneck   Go! Okay! Hang on! Easy, easy! Easy Easy Easy   Will you shut up? We\'re only going one mile an hour! If that! Jesus Aw, shush and push! You guys all better be pushing back there!   We are!   I am pushing.  Swearsies, realsies.  I push.  Son of a bitch then I dunno why this heap of shit\'s not going faster.  Well, first of all, I think you mean heap of bitchin\', and second of all, hang on.  Wh  ? the frickin\' brake was on? God   Dammit, Archer!   Whoo!   Archer! You\'re going too fast, you idiot.  Idiot? Who kept his life\'s work in his frickin\' house, apparently without any kind of backup whatsoever? Uh, yeah, that\'s actually a good point.  I couldn\'t keep my work at the lab.  It\'s potentially worth billions! People would literally kill for it! Whoa, Whoa.  Case in point.  Well, even if I\'m not family Oh, my God, okay What\'s the deal with this algae? I found a way to use it as bio fuel! Am I supposed to know what that means, or? As a replacement for fossil fuels! Oh.  Oh, my God   Duh hoi.  Under the right conditions, the algae reproduce infinitely, and the only by product of burning it, is water.  Holy shit, I\'m surprised nobody\'s killed you already.  That\'s why I had to keep my research a secret.  Can you imagine what this will mean to Big Oil? Or OPEC? Well, there\'s no need to be racist.  How is the acronym for the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries racist? Oh, that\'s what that means? Oh! Goddammit.  This is an American icon! You Philistines! Hey, I know, let\'s, um   uh   teabag Dr.  Seuss.  Yeah, great idea.  I\'ll hold him down.  Huh? Look here, Archer, I\'ve told you about my research.  How about telling me why the hell you carry a gun? Yeah speaking of, I\'m out.  Lemme hold yours while you reload me.  Hold your what? Uh   Lana, come on! Zona peligrosa! What is he talking about? What in the  ? Lana Anthony Kane! Okay, so   Anthony? After Susan B. ! Oh, right, our ugliest president.  Lana, why the hell do you have a gun? That\'s not how we raised you! I know, Daddy.  I know.  So, about my PhD How is this funny? What, seriously? Um, in every possible way.  You\'re a spy? Yes, but I can explain! Oh, you\'re going to explain lying to me and your mother all these years.  and could you please not drive my Mustang like a complete ass bucket! Okay, Lem, I think maybe you\'re transferring a little.  You\'re not angry at me.  You\'re angry at Lana.  I\'m well aware of at whom I\'m angry! But thank you for reminding him.  Yeah, think of me as a mediator.  And spying for whom, exactly? I hope to God it\'s at least for America! Who else would I be spying for? How should I know? All of a sudden I\'m talking to a total stranger! Lana? How does that make you feel? Like I\'m gonna shoot you? Yeah, get in line.  Daddy, of course it\'s America.  Long story short, these days we\'re sort of, contractors for the CIA.  The CIA? Did you just drop in on your way to overthrow a democratically elected government somewhere? Lem, let\'s try to avoid using sarcasm.  I wasn\'t.  You see? This is why I never told you! I knew you wouldn\'t understand! Because you could\'ve been a great scientist, Lana! How could you just throw away your God given talent? But it wasn\'t my talent, Daddy You and Mom just wanted it to be.  Oh, come on, now.  You used to love going to all those science fairs! I used to hate it! Remember, I always threw up in the car on the way there? I\'m sorry Oh, goddammit   Lemuel! From excitement! From terror, but I was always so afraid of letting you and Mom down, that I   I couldn\'t ever tell you how I felt.  Hey.  C\'mon, now.  You could never let us down, honey.  I   I hope you know that.  Really? Oh, Lana, we\'ll always be proud of you, and we\'ll always love you, even when you make stupid, stupid, stupid choices, like him.  Aww.  Well, I think we\'ve made some real progress here, and I\'d say, we\'ve got about the engine locks up, so does anyone have a plan? Anyone? Guys, c\'mon, there\'s no dumb ideas.  What if we grease the tires? How would that possibly help? Hey, yeah, toss out all your empties, that will get rid of some weight, huh? Toss out everything! We\'ve gotta get rid of some of this weight! Well, the speakers are obviously the   No! For the love of God, man, are you quite literally insane? Sorry.  Shut up.  What about all these bowling balls? What? Yes, you ding dongs! Throw out the goddamn bowling balls! Okay! Jesus! And that\'s how they all died.  That\'s your plan? To ram it? Yeah, it\'s called a pit maneuver, I\'ve done it, like, a million times.  Like, three times.  And Daddy, when they crash, they\'re probably gonna come out firing, so get down on the floor, and stay there! What about you? Don\'t worry about me.  This is what I do, and I\'m actually pretty great at it.  Ehh.  Shut up.  Daddy, floor.  Okay, hang on! Actually wait, hang on.  What? Lem, what was the special thing?   What?   In the hot tub! Archer, I think the less said about the hot tub incident, the better! Shut up.  what\'s the special thing you two wanted to share with me? The Kane family reunion! Wait, what? Yeah, we do it every year, it\'s huge, and we told her to invite you, but   Daddy! Lana, the man may be a total idiot, but he is the father of your child.  Yeah, Lana! So are we talking like, a barbecue, or  ? Archer! Okay! Lana! And if it\'s a barbecue, are the Kanes a brisket crowd, or pulled pork? Brisket.  Lame.  Don\'t shoot! Don\'t shoot! Please, don\'t   Darryl? Pam? Oh, my God, I used to beat this bitch\'s ass at fight club, like, all the time!   Sup?   Hey, guys.  Pff, like, three times.  Now, what\'re you doin\' bowling bowlin\' balls in the damn street? Long story, funny story, and I\'ll tell you guys all about it over beers at the nearest titty bar, my treat.  Titties ain\'t gonna fix my car, poovee.  No, but Beard McBoggeyes over there will and he\'ll install a nitrous tank, so you don\'t have to drive around town like a giant pussy.  Won\'t ya, Krieger? Yep! Yep, yep, yep! So c\'mon, let\'s go make it rain Pammy.  What about them? Honestly don\'t care.  Reloading! Archer, cover me! Wait, what? Archer? What the  ? Slater? Ta daa.  With a baby in the house? We didn\'t know you were there, which was obviously an operational failure on our end.    Ethan!   Yeah, Ethan! And don\'t be shitty, Archer, you dick.  You killed one of my guys.  Yeah, was that shot not insane? What is insane is the CIA stealing my father\'s research, Slater! Why? Because, Dr.  Kane, your research has jeopardized our national security.  What? What do you mean? How? Because if you think the Middle East is messed up now, just wait until nobody needs their oil.  Man, you guys are so big picture No, wait, you can\'t   that was a lifetime of work for my father! Yeah, yeah.  Dr.  Kane, do you have online banking? I   yes, but   So, if you wanna go ahead and check your account balance? Huh.  Well, I can tell you right now, this doesn\'t come anywhere close   That amount, direct deposited every month, for the rest of your life.  Every month? Well, Mr.  Slater, I   I think we\'ve got ourselves a deal.  Daddy, no! What about the algae, so we don\'t have to burn fossil fuels? Honey, forget about fossil fuels.  We\'re gonna be able to burn money.  Happy? What, like in general? Because yes.  So, listen I wanna thank you, for trying to save my dad\'s research, and even though I\'m obviously still furious about the hot tub incident, and will be, probably, for years to come, I can see how you   you, Archer, could have misconstrued the situation, and even though it\'s kinda hard for me to admit it, you are family to me, and not just because of A. J.  and I realize now that I should have invited you to the family reunion, so I\'m sorry.  Sorry that I hurt your feelings.  Well, thanks.  I accept your apology.  Sorry I tried to spit roast your mom.I am dead serious.  From now on, no eggs, no pigs\' feet, nothing pickled, or, so help me God, I will put that refrigerator out by the curb.  What? Oh, come on! Those weren\'t pigs\' feet.  Whatever feet, idiot! Now then, we have an assignment, but I won\'t be joining you, so if you\'ll direct your goldfish like attention spans to Mr.  Slater Just Slater, for the "infinitieth" time.  Watch it.  Shut up.  Burn.  Shut up.  Burn.  Okay The young man in the monitor is Crown prince Fawad Fawaz, heir to the throne of the Kingdom of Durhan.  He just got a summer internship on Wall Street Ugh, affirmative action And so he\'s in the city looking for suitable accommodations, something befitting the world\'s richest prince.  Oh, money.  Holy shit.  And so what, he needs bodyguards? Mm, no, I think he\'s all set there Which brings us to my problem, which, coincidentally, is also your problem.  Without the prince or his security team\'s knowledge, I need to scan any and all of his mobile phones, any and all flash drives, both of his handprints, and both of his retinas.  And why? Oh, sorry, let me back up.  This is part of operation because I said so.  Ya know what? I\'m sure I do.  For example, this is a tranquilizer gun, with which I will dart the prince, and then we\'ll have 60 seconds to do all the scans before he wakes up with no side effects and no memory at all of the previous few minutes.  Bullshit, the CIA doesn\'t have that technolo   But before I can tranquilize him, I need access to the prince, so   Uh, and just so we\'re clear, he\'s the prince of Durhan, an allied country.  Yeah, I\'m gonna refer you back to operation said so.  Everybody else, these are your mission dossiers.  Read them on the way to Tunt Manor.  Tunt Manor? That\'s my house! I know! And the prince is on his way there.  So we\'re going there, and because you know the property, you\'ll be posing as the listing agent! Shut up! Burn! Well, just in case I don\'t read this What are the rest of us gonna be doing? Some of you will be assisting me and/or Miss Tunt.  The rest of you will be distracting the prince\'s security team and/or his mother Her Majesty, Queen Yasmin Fawaz.  Whoa, shit.  Damn.  Seriously? What? I just heard you get hard.  Ew.  They were goat feet, and you threw \'em out! Ah, damn you! God damn you all to hell! So the van\'s downstairs.  Turn around.  Now spread your arms.  I do apologize for this necessary precaution, Miss Oh, uh   what do I always tell you? Never apologize.  It is a sign of weakness.  Yes, mother.  So, Miss Uh Escrow.  My last name is Escrow.  Really? Yes, and trust me, I\'ve heard all the jokes.  Oh, boy.  Okay, chinstrap, let me see what we got on the other cameras.  Bathroom one, bathroom two, bathroom three, bathroom four, bathroom five   Are all the cameras in bathrooms? No.  Just my faves.  Bathroom six, bathroom seven, bathr   Shoulda gotten some poison ones.  Okay, people, I want you in position in five minutes.  You should\'ve thought of that before you picked these ridiculous costumes, and why are your plans always so complicated? You\'re like Wile E.  Coyote with access to predator drones.  Out.  I think these uniforms are awesome! Here, let me get some pics of you! To masturbate to? Pfff, please.  Please? Can somebody explain to me why the CIA is spying on American allies? Well, Ray, there were these things called dinosaurs, and when they died, they turned into oil, somehow, and that\'s what your car uses for food.  Thanks, Al.  Al? Jazeera! Look, for all we know, Slater wants all that stuff because the CIA is trying to protect the royal family.  From what? Cabals.  What? Yes, sinister cabals! I bet the royal palace is lousy with them.  So instead of trying to undermine the mission Don\'t undermine it! What the heck got into him? More like what he wants to get into, which, obviously, the queen\'s vagina.  Seriously? Or wherever else.  Although she didn\'t look like a Back Dorothy.  Well we\'ll just see about that The part about Archer having sex with the queen, not the part about the queen being into anal sex.  Who knows? Wow.  This is eerily similar to my spec script for Masterpiece Theater.  Your what? Well, I guess technically it\'s fanfic.  Bringing us to the formal dining room, which seats 80, with plenty of room for servants to skulk around, Ladling turtle soup into sterling silver bowls, their sullen eyes downcast as grandmam makes a joke about chopping off their hands if they spill even a single drop, like we used to do in the Belgian Congo.  Hm.  And how about that chandelier, huh? But I wouldn\'t wanna dust it! An opinion apparently shared by the staff about the rest the furnishings.  If this were my palace, I\'d   What did I tell you, wench? Ow! Stop right there! Who are you? I am Butler.  The butler.  Wait, your name is Butler, or  ? Both! And I\'ve heard every joke! My sincere apologies, Your Majesty, for the deplorable state of the house.  Good help is difficult to find, as I\'m sure Your Majesty well knows.  What I know, you impudent toad, is that if a servant dared speak to me in my palace, I would have him sewn into a burlap sack filled with rats, and the sack thrown into the river.  Burn! Well slapped, Your Majesty.  Come! Let\'s get this over with so I can bathe off all this filth and grime.  Oh, my God, can you believe this? What? What? My commission is gonna be huge! Come, you foolish woman! Coming, My Majesty! Now, is anyone allergic to ocelots? Oh, that\'s right, Babou! Ow, man, what a hate slappin\' bitch.  Yeah, I gotta have sex with her.  Wait, what? But I thought you and Lana were kinda, you know Kinda, you know, what? What\'d she say? Well, nothing, but   See? Classic Lana! So what, you\'re gonna try to bang the queen just to make Lana jealous? No.  That\'ll just be icing   on what I assume will be an extremely moist cake   Blorp.  Because I\'ve had sex with a baroness, a marquise, a vicomtesse, the two princess sisters, um, a duchess   Your mom\'s dog? No.  The wife of a duke? Yes, but I\'ve never had sex with a queen.  Yasmin would be my greatest masterpiece, Pam, my   hang on Moaning Lisa.  Dammit, I was gonna say that.  Girl with a pearl necklace.  The potato eaters.  Stop it! But wait.  Why are you telling me your plan to not make Lana jealous? I dunno, I   Oh, my god, Pam, I think you might be my best friend.  You\'re my best friend! What about Cheryl? You\'re my second best friend! Oh, my God What? Eh, I thought by now I\'d be doing a lot better in the old friend department.  I thought by now I\'d be dead.  Well, day\'s not over Right? He what? I mean   so what? Well, I just figured you\'d wanna know.  No, you just figured it would make me jealous, but, spoiler alert, I don\'t give a shit who Archer bangs.  Well, yeah, no, but if you did, and you wanted to make Archer jealous Then I\'d go break my pussy off on that hot little prince\'s merguez.  Exactly, that\'s what I\'m   Wait, what? Which, come to think of it, would be what my vagina refers to as a "win win. " But wait a minute! Love to, can\'t, got a pussy to break.  Well, that backfired.  Or did it? Yes, yes, it most certainly did.  Okay, people, listen up.  If you\'re not in position, you\'d better get there A. S. A. P.  because   Uh, what\'s that? Because right about now, Cheryl should be leading the Durhanis into The world renowned conservatory! Where Gillette should be ready with a transdermal solution of the most powerful laxative known to man.  I   dammit, I had something for this   Wait, was it something about Dukes? The Tunt Conservatory is home to the world\'s second largest collection of carnivorous plants, the shame of which drove the current owners\' eccentric great uncle, Theophilus Tunt, to commit suicide.  Or maybe it was just the syphilis.  We may never know, and, frankly, it\'s none of our b   Bathroom? What? I\'m sorry, Your Majesty, I don\'t know what\'s wrong, but I need to   Mother! Silence! How dare you? Indeed.  Well slapped, His Majesty.  Now, if you will follow me, into the   Bathroom! Please, Your Majesty! I cannot wait! I told you idiots that wasn\'t the real famous Ray\'s! A thousand pardons.  Foolish woman! Where is a bathroom? Where isn\'t a bathroom? Am I right? All kidding aside, though, the house does have and 18 half baths, all boasting priceless grueby faience tilework, as well as   cucumber water bidets! Now, if your assorted majesties and highnesses will please follow me To elevator number three, where whats her face should be standing by come back.  Stop it! She will bring the prince upstairs, where Archer and Lana are waiting to bring him to me   What? Wait, what? What? What\'s that? Are you in position? Yes? Yeah, I am So I\'m not really sure why you\'re using that pissy tone with me   I   Unless I sound like Lana, who is   hang on   looking around the position, and she is not in position.  Well, where the hell is she? Yeah.  Stand by? Jeez! Ow! Ow! What\'s that? Hey, speaking of Lana and positions Cyril, I either can\'t or merely don\'t want to talk right now, so   Cowgirl? Wheelbarrow? Butter churn? Okay, Gollum, you have won the game of riddles.  The gold ring is yours! Lana and the prince, you idiot! I   wait, what about Lana and the prince? Bow chicka dow dow Ow! Ow! So, that backfired Maybe I should work on my timing.  Please someone Just kill me Be careful what you wish for! Especially if it\'s claustrophobic, manually operated elevators! Because this is what you would get.  And I am embarrassed to say that I have room for only one passenger.  Where, in your belly? Burn.  What? Return! I shall take His Highness, and then I shall speedily return for   Your Majesty.  Whoa.  Oh, my God.  Damn, Gina.  If it please Your Majesty, take the elevator.  I will escort His Highness upstairs via a more scenic route.  Out of the question! I don\'t want him alone without   Mother, this sounds like a win win.  Pardon, but I\'m supposed to   Mother! Woman, I will kill you where you stand! Which, by law I\'m required to tell you, if there\'s been a murder in the house   oh, but if you were the murderer That\'s what I love about this job! You learn something new every   Mother, please! Fawad, habibi, I shall meet you upstairs momentarily.  Mind you, do not tarry.  Well? Blorp.  What the hell? Where is everybody? Here! Present! Hey, where\'s Lana? What the   Well, she\'s not in here, which is where you also shouldn\'t be! What? What? Why aren\'t you in position? Because, Slater, there\'s a   a problem with your tranquilizer gun.  What problem? It goes off for, like, no reason.  Where\'s Lana? I\'m not even a hundred percent sure where I am right now, so   You are hands down my new favorite thing.  Hello? Anybody? What the   Ray? Is that you? Yeah, I need   Good, get off, keep this channel open.  No, I need you guys to   Keep this channel open! God, these people.  Always "me, me, me. " Hey, pretty girl Or boy, or gender fluid, or however you self identify, it\'s all good.  Although that being said Hyahh! Blorp.  Okay, let\'s do this! Whats yer face, Pam, what\'s your   What the shit? What\'s that? Hey, you.  What the hell are you people doing? Thinking about some breakfast, am I right? Oh, my God, chilaquiles? What the  ? Where the hell is my tranquilizer gun? Your what? Your Highness? Could you help me in here, please? And so, beckoned by the servant, a powerful negress giant, Fawad entered the boudoir and soon became a man I seem to have fallen.  I   I seem to see that Can you help me up or vice versa? I think perhaps both? Ideally? Or rather, both, ideally, would be   Hello? Prince? Kid, c\'mon, I mean, I know I\'ve been crushing the post natal yoga, but   Seriously, did you have a stroke? Seriously? You honestly thought you were so physically attractive that you caused a healthy young man to literally   to literally have a, um uh Stroke? Seriously? Well, you better hope I get all this shit scanned before he wakes   What\'s that? I couldn\'t hear you over the sound of   Seriously, just yoga? He said, jealously.  Oh, my God, if anybody\'s jealous, it\'s you.  Hang on, shut up, I have something for this Lana Cougar Mellencamp! What? Look at him! He\'s a child! He\'s 21! I think! Which is more than I can say for most of your sexual partners! What? I   that   I mean, even if that were technically true, it\'s   It\'s what, painfully obvious that the reason you try to drag your dick through every attractive woman you meet is because you\'re not over me? Oh, my God! And just when their anger reaches a fever pitch, in walks Figgis.  I can\'t even formulate a response to that! Because you can\'t argue with the truth! I can! And if anybody\'s not over anybody, it\'s you! With your   your   your   your   your   Timing.  Um, excuse me? Hello? Jesus, my ear balls! Um Oh.  So, here\'s the thing with that I\'ll be seein\' you two later Guards! Gua  ! So not great.  Uh, could be worse.  Coming, Your Majesty! Case in point.  Yeah, they are gonna kill everybody.  Well, dammit! I\'ll have to disclose that! Will somebody do something? Yeah, Lana, get his pants off.  Inappropes, honey.  Wait, were they screwing? Hey! If anybody tells mother about this, I\'ll   Wait, what? What the shit? You idiots! What did you do? Hey, whoa! First of all, your plan was way too complicated.  Maybe for you people! It had everything but a sign for free bird seed, and second of all What the  ? Huh.  I was wondering how many rounds this little guy held Oh, my God, we\'re gonna die.  I gotta get outta here! If they find out the CIA was behind this, it\'ll be an international incident! Yeah, God forbid you guys get caught.  Hello, front desk? Watergate Hotel? This is the Bay of Pigs, in room 61.  Could you send up 1,500 poorly trained Cuban exiles? Ooh, and ice! You done? Yes, that\'s right, and a bucket of ice.  Hmm? What\'s that? No, we won\'t be needing any air cover.  Click.  Now I\'m done.  Then can we   Carol, I\'m assuming all the bedrooms are connected to secret passages? Yeah, so that at night grandfather could look in on the children.  Ew.  Okay, everybody in, and make sure you swing by and get Krieger and Ray on your way out.  Yeah, where is Ray? Well, I gotta hand it to you Wait, what about you guys? Uh, we\'re going to Um uh Beat \'em off   hold them off, so you guys can get away, to   Safety or wherever.  Uh huh.  Okay, so obviously we\'ll need to talk about what just happened, so um Shitter? Or wherever.  Your Majesty! What in the Mother? Your Highness! Your Majesty! You\'re alive! Tear this place apart! And when we find these American pigs, they will eat their own eyes before we kill them! Oh, my God Lana! It\'s like   it\'s like the danger makes it that much hotter! Yeah, yeah, that, plus your dick! Right? Totally.  Oh, my God Well, I hope you\'re all pleased with yourselves because thanks to your latest fiasco, after he makes a formal protest at the U. N.  tomorrow, the Durhani ambassador is being recalled.  Whichit was all Slater\'s fault.  Sterling, I swear to God Malory it was, he   And why are you taking Sterling\'s side? Because Shut up! Burn! Slater\'s plan was just   Fakakta! And I was counting on that commission, and now the homeowners are taking the house off the market.  You do realize you\'re the homeowner.  Still though.  Oh, shut up, and unless there\'s anything else, you can all get out.  Actually, there is one other thing.  What? I think Ray deserves a hand.  God dammit! Oh, come on, we were all thinking it Cause you got no freaking hand, stupid!Come on, you know you want it.    You don\'t know what I want.  Oh, yes, I do.  Come on, just the tip.  I don\'t know.  It\'s pretty big.  I think it\'s just the standard breakfast burrito size.  Here, first take a bite of mine.  No, first you take a bite of mine.  Let\'s do it together.    Is that crazy? Oh, my God, okay.    Mmm.    Oh, my, God.    Men\'s room?   Broom closet.  It\'s dirtier.  No, bring the burrito.  Oh, my, God! Well, we were all thinkin\' it.  That and how chili\'s not breakfast.  Well, technically anything\'s breakfast, if it\'s your first meal of the day.  Oh, then Ray\'s right.  And also, duh.  Well, hooray.  Give yourself a hand.  You know what? I know you better sit your ass down before I slam an Easy Spirit up it.  Oooh! Whoa, hey, Pam, Ray, come on you two.  You\'re not mad at each other.  You\'re mad at the unspeakably revolting symbiotic mass of bodily fluids that is now Archer and Lana.  They make me sick! Rub it in our faces how we\'re doomed to be alone.  Well, your face.  And Ray\'s, I guess.  Wait, nobody\'s rubbin\' off in my face.  Yeah, that\'s her point.  And think how hard watching them must be for Cyril.  No! It\'s   That\'s not   I mean, come on! I\'m totally over Lana, so Cyril! You can lie to yourself   Obviously, look at your sweater.    but don\'t lie to Team Breakup.    Uh what?   Guys, it\'s obvious what we gotta do.  Throw acid in their kissy faces.  No! Wait! You want to try to break them up? I mean, it\'s either that or Ssss No! The solution to every problem isn\'t throwing frickin\' acid on it! Unless the problem is a solution with an overly alkaline pH balance.  Krieger, hush! Pam? You have a plan? I don\'t know.  Maybe we could do something like one of those bait cars? But obviously, the car would be a vagina.  Hmm.  Okay, so we get a woman that Archer would find irresistible.  Maybe by having her fog a mirror.  Then put her in Archer\'s path, and his pathological need to sleep with every woman he meets does the rest.  Or, you know, a lot of couples break up if their kid dies.  Really? Whoa! Yeah.  Easy peasy.  We hire somebody to kidnap their fat, gross baby.  There\'s this huge man slash baby hunt.  It\'s in all the newspapers.  On the wireless.  America\'s going apeshit.  Then, we double cross the kidnapper, who obviously we paid with easily traceable gold certificates.  We plant a shitload of dicey evidence in his garage.  Tip off the cops   he\'s basically convicted of being German, and then, bzz zap! Dirtnap for the kraut! Compliments of old Sparky.  God damn! Wireless? But wait.  If it\'s a kidnapping   Uhh! The child is sent to Bhutan, where for the next 20 years, she\'s raised and trained as an assassin by Ra\'s al Ghul before returning to destroy those who once betrayed her.  Us.  Yes! But it buys us time.  Oh, my God, Lana.  That was insane! It\'s insane, like, every time now.  What is going on with you?   Go going on with me how? What do you mean?   I mean   and uh, don\'t take this the wrong way, but   did your dick get bigger? I don\'t think so.  Is that a thing? I think I would have heard of it! Wait, in Le Retour de Martin Guerre, didn\'t his get bigger? Nope.  His feet got smaller.  Oh.  Well, I know my feet are the same.  His wife fell in love with him when he came back because he was caring and loving, which he wasn\'t before.  Larger penis probably didn\'t hurt.  And I\'m sure my feet are the same, Lana.  My cordwainer would have said something.  Well, whatever it is, for some reason I don\'t have to suppress my gag reflex now whenever you mention your cordwainer.  Well, what should I call him? A shoemaker? What I\'m trying to say is, you were different than you were when you dated the first time.  More mature, maybe? And definitely more focused on me.    Well?   As opposed to every single woman you meet in a bar or at a party or just merely walking down the street.  I   yeah.  Uh.  I\'m sorry for that time.  Zzz.  Times, yes.  Plural.  And I promise you, that won\'t ever happen again.  It better not.  Because this time   It\'s really kinda good, right? No, Archer, it\'s great! Somehow.  I can\'t remember when I was this happy! You recently gave birth to a child.  Shit, right! But besides that, this is the happiest I\'ve been in a while! Which, obviously, is why we can\'t tell mother we\'re dating again.  Obvious? Because she\'d try to break us up somehow.  She can\'t stand for me to be in a relationship.  I think it actually causes her physical pain.  You realize your relationship with Malory isn\'t a huge selling point? Y yeah.  So, to make up for it, what say I bend you back over the mop sink? Bring it, Sommersby.  Because, you ding dong, our bait car hooker has to be hotter than Lana.    Pfft, that won\'t be hard!   What? Did you suddenly go blind? No, phew! But Pam, come on.  The prostitutes on this website are like   jeezy petes! Some of them are 10,000 a night! Yeah.  So two grand apiece! Are you   I wouldn\'t even pay $2,000 to get myself laid.  Well, maybe now, but a few more weeks without that hand That\'s not even the hand   I don\'t see how that\'s any of your beeswax! Speaking of, do I smell beeswax?   Probably.    Maybe you can pay one of these high class hookers with it.    Really?   No! Damn.  Because I\'m not chipping in 2,000 bucks.  Or even 1,000.  Because I just found out our shitty insurance doesn\'t cover prosthetic limbs! Really? How do you not   you\'re head of H. R. ! Probably because I got two frickin\' hands! Earballs.  If I wanted to hear you people scream, I\'d have you flown to a CIA black site in Morocco and listen to your torture session on speakerphone! Speaking of, any word from Slater? No.  Not a word from the CIA since you idiots ruined the mission with the Durhani royal family.  So I have no idea what our status is.  For all I know, we\'re wanted for treason again.  Well, no news is good news.  You do realize this is an intelligence agency? Ostensibly.  What? Nothing.  Yeesh.  Why don\'t we just tell her they\'re dating? She\'ll make them so crazy they\'ll break up on their own.  Because then she would tell them we told her, and then even if I did want Lana back   which I don\'t   It wouldn\'t matter! Because Mr.  Archer would feed you your own bones! Well, I don\'t know about that! Please.  You\'d die of marrow poisoning.  So come on! Let\'s pick a hooker! One that Archer\'s never had sex with.  Is there one? You\'re forgetting what the largest sex organ on the human body is.  The penis? Well, I was gonna say vagina.  I was gonna say Pam\'s vagina.  Me too.  The brain! Eww! Eww! Not like that   what is wrong with you people? Ray\'s missing a hand.  Archer won\'t risk his relationship with Lana for a previous conquest   especially a prostitute! For a man like him, it\'s all about the hunt.  They\'re all gonna have   I said hunt.  Oh.  Still, though So we have to pay a hooker up front to bump into Archer somewhere and just hope he\'s never banged her? Come on, it\'s New York.  I bet it\'s 20,000 hookers here.  What are the odds Mr.  Archer already banged whichever one we pick? I was gonna say 50/50.  Me too.  I was gonna say "Pam\'s vagina. " So, we have to find a beautiful woman who Archer\'s never had sex with.  Or   Well, that counts me out.  Me too.  Which part? Keep it up, Stumplestiltskin.  Or, both of you shut up.  Better yet, a woman who has a powerful psychological hold over Archer.  Please, tell me you don\'t mean his mother.  What? Yeah, because even for us   I\'m not talking about Miss Archer! The only woman Archer ever really cared about besides Lana is What? Who? Seriously? Yeah.  Who is it? Hang on, before we call her, are we sure we want to do this? No, you\'re my smoochy boochy.  No, you\'re my smoochy boochy.  Eww.  Ugh.  So.  Is there a country code, or   Da? Yes.  This is Colonel Kazanova.  Yes.  Oh, really? Yes? Yes? I understand.  Yeah.  Yes.  Good bye.  Who was that? Who was who? What are you talking about? Uh   you were   Did you just now have telephone call? No! Don\'t be an idiot.  Also, I must go to America.  Unrelated to the telephone call that I just did not receive.  Cyril! Archer.  How are you holding up, buddy? With regard to   Me and Lana? Oh ho.  Right.  Gotta be tough, huh? Yeah, I\'m barely muddling through.  I\'m sensing a little sarcasm.  Really? Yes, Cyril, I am.  Maybe that\'s because I don\'t care that you\'re dating Lana, because you\'ll never have what she and I had.  Like what? Like uh I don\'t know, Archer.  The little things.  Like Stir Friday.  You\'re right, Cyril.  Nothing I could do could ever compare to the sensual pleasures to be found in a greasy wok full of tiny ears of corn and meat the exact size and shape of dice.  Which   You just realized is why that method of chopping food is called "dicing. " Maybe.  And maybe since it\'s Friday, Cyril, tonight, I\'m gonna make Lana stir fry! You   what? No! Yes! So, soy you later! "Soy!" Operation Stir Cry day is go, over.  Copy that, Figgis Newton.  What? And also, shitty operation name.  Why can\'t you use the women\'s? And why\'d you give me a walkie talkie? Why do you care?   About either?   Wait.  What? Dinner? Tonight? My place? I\'ll cook.  What is this, like a word scramble? No, it\'s like me cooking you dinner.  You, as in, Woodhouse? No, me as in me, Lana.  I don\'t even know where Woodhouse is.  I actually haven\'t seen him in, like, weeks.  Uh huh.  I\'m cooking.  Me, Lana.  Me.  Me! You two and your constant bickering.  What is it this time? Lana\'s hogging the copier.  I swear to sweet Jesus Okay, Julia Childish.  I\'ll get a sitter for A. J.  So, what time is dinner? And can I bring anything? Let\'s say sevenish, and yes, you can bring Wait.  What? Come on! Sorry, I had to get stakeout supplies, and   What happened to your van? We can\'t stake out Archer\'s apartment in the rush van, it\'s way too iconic.  Wait, this is actual ice cream.  Plus, I\'ve been moonlighting.  Shut up! Okay, little help here, nerm nerts.  Think you got enough beer? No.  But I brought a couple joints.  No, it\'s cool.  I got it, Woodhouse.  Unless you came home? You little scamp! Woodhouse? Woodhouse! Seriously, I hope he didn\'t die.  Meemo.  Check obituaries.  Meemo.  Tell Woodhouse to buy newspap   damn! No, that\'s just a feedback loop.  Wha   God damn it, Woodhouse, you stack of bones, if you\'re using my bathroom, you\'re gonna need an obitu   What the   Woodhouse? No, my darling.  It is I! Katya? Well, you sound surprised, darling.  Well, wh   Why are you in my bathroom? Oh, I was just preparing.  In my apartment.  In America! Oh, I just had to see you, darling.  I have been longing for your tender touch.  Well   but just, like, out of the blue? Was Barry\'s touch not tender? Or   I   how you say, uh   "dump" Barry.  All right! You knew this? I assumed it was bound to happen, since Barry was such a douche.  And still is.  Presumably.  And also alive, and not crushed and then burned to death in a grain silo.  Presumably.  What is the matter, darling? Are you not excited to see your Katya? Mm no, "excited" is actually the exact word I would have cho   ho ho haw   oh.  Oh, my God! This is, like, the perfect day.  Ahh! The day Archer finally gets what\'s been coming to him all these years.  So, wait.  When did you put all those cameras in his apartment? The same time I did the rest of   you know what\'s good? Hochschiebens! Yeah, let\'s all have a hochschieben! Mmm! Das ist lecker, no? Yes! I mean, no.  I mean, my neck\'s all sweaty.  It can\'t possibly taste good, so   I love, is   is salty.  It\'s like caviar.  Which, boy! Talk about an acquired taste, huh? And a little known fact   Uh, darling, you\'re on fire! Oh, my God.  Yeah.    So are you.    No.    Literally.    You mean figuratively.  Oh, God, there\'s so much we never had time to Uh, darling, there.  The champagne.  Oh, ho.  Very high in cholesterol.  Caviar.  Darling, are you all right? Yeah.  I\'m fine.  Messrs.  Kilgour, French, Stanbury, Turnbull and Asser not so much.  Oh, well, then let\'s get you out of these wet clothes, and into something Dry? Oh, I can promise you, it is not dry.  Blorp.  Well, in the immortal words of Wendell Stamps, that\'s going in the slide show! No offense.  Why would I be offen   Oh, baby, it is all over everything.  So is Cheryl.  Will you get off? That\'s what she said, right? More like what he said.  Katya, please.  Please, I have to tell you something.  I\'m listening.  Go ahead, baby.  They\'re jingling, baby.  I didn\'t know you were a fan of early crossover mainstream hip hop.  Oh! Or that you were that strong.  Oh, my God.  I\'m glad I\'m not a woman.  Da, baby, ya tozhe.  No, in a general sense.  Look! Look, look, look, look! Here comes Lana! Oh, man, I don\'t want to sound greedy, but a threesome and then a break up? Or a foursome, and I\'m the pizza guy? You have pizza? Dahlink, I do not understand.  I know, and me neither.  This is all uncharted territory for me.  But I\'ve changed, Katya.  I\'ve changed.  Well, I have also changed.  My new operating system includes the entire kama sutra Wow! Okay.  The first edition of the old Mr.  Boston Official Bartender\'s Guide Eep! And a deep, hard wired understanding and appreciation of men\'s lacrosse.  What did I   darling, wait! What? Out o\' order.  Yes, thank you.  I can see that.  Why you ask? Out of order? I\'ll show you out of order.  Lana Kane? The giant negress? Hey! Now come on.  She\'s not   What? A negress? Gigantic.  I mean, she\'s tall, but a lot of that\'s the boots, and the hair   and those hands aren\'t doing her any favors, human size wise.  She\'s basically Groot.  I mean, in the dark it\'s like Eubie Blake\'s reaching out for you, but   But you prefer her to me? I mean, no, but wait.  You slept with Barry at our wedding! Da ah! At second wedding.  Oh.  Right.  At our first wedding   I saved your life from Barry, and in process, I lose my own life! But then again, you slept with him at our second wedding, which kinda   You were the one who could not deal with the fact that I am now cyborg! You were the one who banged Barry!  Bozhe moy! You have not changed a bit! Ha! Shows what you know! You Barry banger! I have changed! I have a kid! Chto? Yeah.  A little baby girl, Abbiejean.  With Lana.  And then we started going out again, and somehow it\'s Kind of amazing, really.  We\'re, like, connecting, you know? And I realize that all this time, even though we fought like cats and a very tall dog, we\'ve always been best friends.  And then to realize you might actually be in love with your best friend who also happens to be the mother of your child   That\'s, like, a miracle.  And so even though I\'ll always have a special place for you in my heart, and obviously in my slide show, I   Your what? It doesn\'t matter.  I   I feel like I just found Lana after all these years, and I can\'t risk losing her again.  I   Don\'t know what to say, Sterling.  I feel   I feel like   A great big, jerky giant asshole.  Right! Well? Are we just gonna sit here? Lazy, lazy, fatty fatty gaijin! Whee! I mean, how do you not murder her every day? I do.  No, please, I feel like the asshole.  I mean, look at you.  I literally cannot believe I\'m asking you to go.  But you must.  Yeah.  I\'ve seen her crush a cue ball.  Oh, I forgot something in bathroom.  I\'ll mail it to you.  But you got to go now! She\'ll be here any second.  Whoo! Suck it, you dick stairs.  Is a bit awkward, to leave from balcony.  I know, sorry, but the elevator\'s out, and I can just see you two running into each other on the stairs.  Uh, no, I mean because the last time I leave your apartment from balcony   Oh, right! You died.  But the last time, I did not have this.    Wow.    Da.  It is also very good for bondage, mild BDSM, things of this nature.  I bet.  May I kiss you good bye, Sterling? Yes.  Yes, pleas   I will miss you.  Very much.  Me too.  But if it\'s any consolation, I\'ll be thinking of you the next several times I have sex with Lana.  Well, good bye Sterling.  Oh, holy shit, I got to make stir fry.  Why is the door open? That\'s weird.  Lana! What? What the shit? There\'s   Oh, I got a stitch.  What are you idiots doing here? What am I even doing here? Well, Archer, the first thing you\'re doing is making a very stiff drink.  Well? Cyril? You gotta What? Cyril\'s gotta tell you something.  No I don\'t! Yeah, you do.  Yeah, Cyril! That is just Cyril! What? Lana, please don\'t go in there because I still love you.  There.  I said it.  Wow.  Yeah! Ha! So.  How\'s all that going? Not great.  Jesus, Woodhouse really is gone, huh? Which   here are your flyers.  Yeah, I actually don\'t need them.  What? After I made all these copies? Well, who\'s gonna put \'em up, Lana? Hey! Whoa.  I did not just schlep my ass up your jillion idiot stairs   to eat your shitty attitude for dinner, mister.    I   I might as well go eat with Cyril.  At least he can cook stir fry.  And, he\'s still totally in love with me.  Wha\'? Yeah.  Right outside, just dumped his purse all over the welcome mat.  Ugh! So pathetic.  Seriously.  Maybe try growing a pair.  But here I am with the old Archer.  Wha\'   I\'m not the old Archer.  I\'m the new Archer! I\'ve changed, Lana.  Please, you\'re halfway to half in the bag.  As usual, walkin\' around in your   Why are you in your spreefs? They compliment my active lifestyle? Archer Um Uh huh.  Oh, what, what, Lana! Wait! No, there\'s nothing in there.  You call this nothing? Yeah, so Because I call it smoochy boochy town.  Uh   hmm? Smooth jazz, rose petals, candles   not sure what happened there, but oh, my gosh! And Dom Prignon? Which, I assume, was delicious.  Uh, expensive fire extinguisher.  Well, then go get a few more bottles out of the fridge just to be safe, because I am gonna burn you down! Back in a sec, new Archer Yeah.  I I am new! I am, Lana.  I mean, I feel like a brand new man! I\'ve really changed! Really? Ee yah! Then why is there a vagina in the sink! Um, so Funny story.I don\'t know but I think we\'re pretty close.  What? Well blame these road signs.  They don\'t have any vowels.  Yes, and thanks for watching AJ.  I   No, as a matter of fact I don\'t think it\'s a good opportunity to quote "work some of that fat off her", unquote.  I   Mother, she\'s a goddamn baby! No, I have to go so   I will! And if I find out you gave her diet pills, Mother, no kidding,   I will have you arrested!   Hmm? Do what?   Who\'s having a rest?   I heard you, now I gotta go.  Goodbye.    Hey, sleepyhead.    Hey you.    Mmm, man, I was out.    Yeah you were.  Where are we? Seriously, what is this, the Shire?   No, uh   it\'s     Wait, wait, wait.  What the shit? Where are we? Where is AJ?   She\'s with Mother.  Calm down, I     Why am I in a car, in a trench coat, and lingerie? Why am I in   Oh my God, there was a vagina in your sink!   Okay, technically yes, but     I caught you cheating on me.    No you didn\'t because no I wasn\'t.    Stop the car, let me out.    You stop it now! Calm down?   Lana, calm down.    Yes! I can explain if you     Yeah, explain how I just woke up in weird clothes in a weird car, in   Archer, where are we?   Wales.    Wales?   Yeah, surprise is ruined.    No it\'s not! I am extremely surprised!   Really?   Because the last thing I remember, we were arguing in   your bedroom!   Yeah, I wanted to explain everything but you were totally freaking out, so I thought let\'s go somewhere neutral, you know? Talk things out.  So we\'re going to this little farm right on the coast.  It\'s remote but it\'s got this real, kinda rugged beauty, you know? It\'s actually very romantic.  Oh.  So just curious, what happened between your bedroom and right now? Well you were hysterical, Lana, so I thought the best thing to do would be inject you with a tranquilizer, drive you to a private airfield, put you on a CIA plane, fly you overnight to Wales and then that brings us to now.    Huh.    And I know drugging women isn\'t cool at all, ever, and obviously I would never, ever do that for any sort of sexual assaulty reason.  I mean for one thing, I\'d never need to.  That\'s what the whole fight was about in the first place, right? Women throwing themselves at   Stop the car.    Choking     Sorry, maybe you can\'t hear me over the sound of all the blood vessels bursting in your eyes.  I said stop.  Ahh! Ahh! Well, I hate to say it, but you were right.    It is kind of romantic.    Yeah, right? I\'m pretty sure there\'s a fireplace.  There, see? Quaint little farmhouse, a cozy little fire going.  I mean this place is right out of a fairytale.  Yeah, a fairytale in which the heroine is drugged and kidnapped.  You realize that\'s like every fairytale.    I do now that you mention it!   Don\'t yell at me.    I\'m not the one advocating rape and child cannibalism.    No! You\'re the one whose ex girlfriend left her robot vagina in your sink.  Unbeknownst to me, Lana! Jesus, we\'ve been through this like ten times already.  Well, sorry I\'m hazy on the details of what happened right before I was drugged   and stuffed in a cargo hold.    It wasn\'t the c   You were in a seat.    Is that supposed to make it better?   That is better! Like, empirically.    I am leaving.    No no, wait, wait, wait.    Let me explain.    If you don\'t let go of me, you\'re gonna have to explain how   those tampons got driven into your brain.    Thanks for these, by the way.  And Lana, I swear I didn\'t call Katya.  I just came home and there she was.  And why would she just show up?   I think the idiots called her.    What idiots?   Alrighty, can someone give me a hand?   But, Doctor, I thought the   patient was getting the hand.    Speaking of hands, Nurse, I\'m     Overplaying yours?   Well I was gonna say "putty in yours",   my dear, but I\'ll have to hand it to ya.    Hm, keep your hands to yourself, Doctor.  Can we have a show of hands? Who thinks this is getting out of hand? Goddamn it! Can you please shut up and sew on my robot hand?   Hand job.    So they call Katya because they\'re jealous we\'re dating.    She shows up     Unbeknownst.    And nothing happens, even though all your clothes get burned off, champagne gets jizzed everywhere and her vag   winds up in the sink.    Yes.    So, you\'re saying it was     Literally a farce.  Exactly, yes!   Ah.  Lana, come on.  Whose life through no, or sometimes maybe moderate fault   of his own, is as farcical as mine?   Hmm.    You still shouldn\'t have drugged me.    No, I know, that was   Extremely uncool.  Mmm, that\'s not though.  Holy shit.  Right? Glengoolie: for the best of times.  And after we\'re done here, well we\'ll have to rent a new car, but we can drive up to the distillery and   Done here, at our romantic fairytale getaway where you make up for all the idiot Archer shit you pulled over the past 24 hours? Yes, and   Here\'s the thing.  What the   Freeze!   Whoa, whoa, steady on.    Freeze or I\'ll   I have no weapon.  Archer!   Ah, so you\'re Archer.    Uh, yes.    And are those tampons?   Also yes.  Right, so if he\'s Archer,   I suppose that makes you Lana Kane.    I   Yes, actually.  And I suppose that makes you   Who the hell are you? Lloyd Llewellyn.  This is my brother, David.  Say hello to the lady, David.  Hello, lady.  Hello, human giant.  And follow up question: why the hell are you here?   Ah.  Have you not told her?   Yeah, so, even though it\'s a romantic fairytale getaway, there\'s also kind of a work component to it.    Lana?   What? Come on, it\'s like 30 bucks a glass.  So if I understand the situation correctly, we\'re supposed to help these terrorists who   Well you obviously don\'t understand the situation, because we\'re not terrorists.  We\'re freedom fighters.  They\'re the Free Wales Army, Lana.    "Fe godwn ni eto. "   Oh yeah, that\'s   that\'s right, David.  Good lad.  Leg hurts.    Yes, it will do, Dav.  You\'ve been shot.    So we\'re supposed to help George and Lennie here out of the country because they\'re wanted by MI5?   Yeah, that\'s what Mother said.    MI5, from England.    Our ally.    Well they\'re no ally to Wales.  What are you   It\'s the same country, Lloyd!   Tell that to Dyffryn Thebwys.    Duffer who? Dyffryn Thebwys.  It was a town in Wales that had stood proudly for a thousand years until the Saesnig   the English, deliberately flooded it.    Oh my God, to drown everybody?   No, to make a reservoir.  They needed water! So they built a dam and that flooded Dyffryn Thebwys, and   all the people lost their homes.    My God, countless thousands of them!   Well, 48.    Thousand!   No, just 48.  You know, four dozen.    Are you   Still though! So now they\'re all homeless? Well, no.  They were compensated, so they got new houses somewhere else and well, in many cases, much nicer ones.    Then what\'s the problem?   Who are you, Josephine Stalin?   That shit wouldn\'t happen in America.    Yes it would, and does, all the time.  The TVA has flooded thousands of Americans out of their homes.    The what?   Tennessee Valley Authority? Remember Deliverance? How the whole valley was gonna   be flooded?   Lana, I hate to break it to you   I even hate to say it out loud, but Deliverance was just a movie.  Oh, my God.  So what exactly are you wanted by MI5 for?   Uh, we tried to blow up a dam.    A dam? What, to flood a bunch of other people out of their homes?   Well not real people.  Just English ones.    Excuse me.  Christ, is she always this angry?   She\'s not mad at you, Lloyd.  She\'s mad at me.    For what? Um, okay.  So I was engaged to this smoking hot Russian woman.    Lieutenant Ginger Bayliss.    Clamp.  Played by Odessa Cleveland.  Who later had a guest spot as a nurse on Trapper John, M. D.  What? Starring Pernell Roberts as the titular Trapper John, somehow.    In a drama, which was totally weird.    But not as weird as Ed Asner.  Mary Tyler Moore\'s Lou Grant.  Playing Lou Grant in the show Lou Grant,which was also a drama.  Okay, yeah, but besides one nurse, M*A S*H didn\'t have any black characters.    Actually it did have one.    And his name was Spearchucker.    What?   Spearchucker Jones.    I mean     Okay yeah, maybe in the book or that crazy football movie, but I\'m talking about   Yeah, the show!   On network television!   In America, and not that long ago.    But how is this even possible?   Well I know it may seem strange.  What, aiding our ally\'s enemies? Well it makes sense! When you\'re the biggest kid in the schoolyard, if your little   friends have a bully     You want them to come running to you.    Exactly.  And Slater says     Wait, you talked to Slater? Yes, Lana.  Obviously I\'ve spoken to Slater, and he says the CIA does this sort of thing all the time, so   So, did he say why he keeps giving us these assignments that   always seem to blow up in our faces?   No.    Although speaking of blowing up     Malory, she\'s a baby, and she weighs exactly as much as she\'s supposed to, so you better be feeding her! I am, it\'s just  Hello? Please.  As if I wouldn\'t feed you.  Now who wants a wittle ice chip? No? I suppose you\'d prefer a nice big bottle of that liquid butter fat.  Goat, swear to Christ, I\'ll have your hide as boots and the rest of you as a curry! Go on, shoo! Shoo! Sh   hit.  Shit, shit!   Ah, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit.    No shit, I\'m telling you guys, Katya looked absolutely amazing.  The tiniest, laciest lingerie you\'ve ever seen.  Sexy stiletto heels.    And a good body, huh?   Good? I mean, you\'re from the UK, so you don\'t have anything to compare it to, but no Lloyd.  Not good.    Insane.    David! And she was just like rubbing all over me.  But nothing happened? No, nothing.  Well, except for the goodbye kiss which was definitely NSF Wales, if you know what I mean.  Oh, you little   I say, pardon me.  Madam.  Hello?   Lana, hey.  We were just   not talking.    Shut up.  Already was, so   So, is it possible you two were followed here by MI5?   Ummmmmm Yeah.    What?!   Yeah, they\'re quite good.    Son of a   Archer, passport.    What, why do you  ?   Give me your passport! Here.    Ah, for the love of   "Randy Randalman"?   Yeah.  Randy grew up on the wrong side of the tracks, ran with a bad crowd, got into some trouble, went to juvie.  Uh, he worked in the mess hall there, fell in love with cooking, and so when he got out he went to culinary school and now he\'s got two restaurants, Lana, one Michelin star and a marriage that\'s on the rocks.  He\'s here to go balls deep on farm to table, you know.  Trying to get back to basics.  Archer   Like that time Rocky went to Russia.  Just get in that closet over there and take Lurch with you.  David.  Wait, he\'s the one they\'re looking for.  Why am I getting in the closet? Because I said so! How is your American accent? Um, I guess it\'s okay, I mean like, you know, like, people are always like, you know.    Like, you know, it\'s crap?   No dude, people really dig it.  People from where, dude? Quebec? He\'s the one who should be in the closet! No, wait.  Oh, hang on.    Lana, why am I in the closet?   Because I said so! I think this\'ll really help sell it.  What? Randy doesn\'t wear nerd goggles! He\'s a culinary bad boy! Open the door, please.    Get in the closet!   I am getting in the closet because I choose to get in the closet.  Come on, Gort.  David.  Okay, Randy.  Follow my lead.    Yes?   Good afternoon.  My name is Bardsley.  I\'m with MI5.    MI5, my goodness! Please, do come in.    Uh, what\'s the problem here?   Well the problem, Mister um     Randalman, Randy Randalman.  I\'m an American.  Right.  Uh     Uh yeah, I\'m here to learn about farm tables.    I beg your pardon?   I thought it was dams.    Shh! Come on, buddy.    David.  Farm to table, he meant to say.  He\'s a chef.    An American chef.    He knows you\'re American, honey.  Uh, the reason I\'m here.  We\'re searching for Welsh terrorists.  Welsh terrorists? Is there even such a thing? Yes, I\'m afraid so.  The self styled Free Wales Army.  "Fe godwn ni  " Shh! If you stay really, really quiet, I will buy you a puppy that you will probably accidentally strangle.  And we\'ve reason to believe they\'re in the area, and that one of them is wounded.  So we\'re canvassing all the farms, and when we saw the damaged vehicle   A bee flew in it and I crashed.  A bee flew into aconvertible? Look, our marriage is on the rocks, and also I have two Michelin tires, so   Right.  May I just see your passport again, please? Oh good heavens.  Wow.    What the   Shit!   Mmm, whoa.  This is actually why we\'re here in Wales.  To try to save our marriage.  Oh, my God, baby.  I think it\'s working.  Are you joking or insane? Do you really expect me to believe you came to Wales for a romantic getaway? Easy, bro.  Wales is kickass! Honey! I do, because we did.  I mean if this weren\'t a romantic getaway, would I be doing this? Mmm!   What the shit?   Or this? Closet rampage! Right, then obviously I\'ve made an extremely embarrassing mistake.  So uh     What the shit, Lana?   Aha! "Aha", what?   Who is this man?   I   Wait, shit.  Who am I? You\'re Lloyd Llewellyn, if I don\'t miss my guess, which means   your brother David can\'t be too far off.    Uh, in the closet, jacking off in a hat.    David!   No I\'m not.  Yes you are! And I\'m not Lloyd Llewellyn.  He is!   Oh, Archer.    Archer? As in Sterling Archer?   Yes, you idiot!   As in Sterling Archer of the CIA?   I mean no, you idiot.  I mean     My God.    Then you must be Lana   Ugh!   Way to go, Randy.    Ugh, how is this Randy\'s fault?   Oh, I\'m sorry.  Did someone else just barge in here yelling their idiot head off about being with the CIA? Oh, I don\'t know.  Was someone else making out with Frodo P.  Gryffindor here,   just to make someone else jealous?   Well, maybe now you know how I feel.  Actually I don\'t know how you feel Lana, because I didn\'t make out with Katya! Oh no? You didn\'t jam your fat tongue down her throat on that goodbye kiss? You were eavesdropping!   Uh yeah, I\'m a spy.    Oh, right.  And I also heard you raving about how insane Katya\'s body was! Is! But not as insane as your mind! And her stilettos, and her lingerie, and her big, fat,   vibrating robot vagina!   And you\'re making my point for me! And   how? It\'s easy not to bang your ex if she\'s gone all frump a dump.  The fact that Katya\'s still crazy hot makes it all the more commendable I didn\'t bang her! I\'m sorry, I think one of us must have just suffered a massive stroke.    Oh, sorry.  That\'s me, just making toast.    Tooooast!   Yes, come and have some toast, David.    Ugh, make him wash his hands first.  Okay so, what do we do about this? Well, since apparently we\'re seeing other people now     Oh?   Not you.  Not us, I meant sleepy Floyd here.  Right, shit.  He knows we\'re with the CIA, thanks to your fat mouth.  Well it was your fat mouth all over him that started this whole thing.  Here, both of you.  Get your fat mouths around some hot, crispy toast.    Toooast!   Damn it, David! Come and have some toast! It\'s obvious what we have to do with him.  Shoot him.    What?   We\'re not shooting an MI5 agent.  That\'s like shooting   a cow.    How is that like     Lana, cows are our friends!   They may even be our best friends.    We have to shoot him! If we don\'t, Downing Street will know the CIA\'s bankrolling the Free Wales Army! "Fe godwn ni eto. " David, come and have the bloody toast or I\'m throwing it in the bloody bin.    He does have a point, Lana.    Yeah, I hate to waste good toast.  We are not murdering an MI5 agent.    End of sentence, end of discussion.    Are you sure there\'s nothing I can do   or say to change your mind, Lana?   Very.    Well then could you hold the toast?   Damn it!   Lloyd?   Yeah, grabbed it while you were arguing.  You never read Rosenberg\'s writings on nonviolent communication?   Uh, no.    Ah it really helped me and David.    Well, maybe we\'ll check that out.    Uh, don\'t bother.  Because before I shoot this MI5 asshole, I\'m gonna have to shoot the both of you.    Wait, what?   Ah, don\'t worry.  We\'ll always have   You think he was gonna say "table"?   I think probably "Wales".    Lloyd! Uh, so, that\'s a problem.    Nope, that is your problem.    Uh, then may I have the gun please?   No.    Oh my God, you are so immature.  And you are so big.  This is gonna be all Daniel Boone.  Alrighty, I think that\'s got it.  Nurse, would you close for me?   Uh, you already did that, Doctor.    Oh right.  Well then would you open for me? Goddamn it! Stop sexually harassing me!   Sorry.    Jesus.  Seriously.  Come on, Tinker Toy, let\'s go pound some homemade gin! So wait, how did we get to talking about African American characters on M*A S*H? Well the M*A S*H connection is obvious, perhaps even painfully so, but the African American thing? Nope, no idea.  But all things considered, that went about as well as could be expected.  Oh yeah? Which part? Leaving two Welsh terrorists basically at large, or kidnapping an MI5 agent?   Well first of all, both.    How   And second of all I was talking about our argument and how now you realize   you overreacted about Katya.    I   Oh my God.    Admit it, Lana.    I admit nothing.  Although, I do think we both learned that trust is important and   I don\'t know, whatever! Trust!   Is that the best I\'m gonna get out of you?   Yup.  By far.  Well then I accept your non apology.  And? Oh my God, and I promise to try not to get into compromising situations with other women.  Best I can do.  Well then let\'s just get this limey bastard on that CIA plane and let Slater worry about the blowback.  You don\'t think they\'ll kill him, do you? No, then they\'d have to kill us.  But, before we go back to the States   Archer, I am not driving to Scotland with a kidnapped MI5 agent in the back   just to visit a stupid distillery.    It\'s not stupid, Lana, it\'s   Glengoolie: for the best of times.  Although you\'re right.  It\'s probably not the smartest idea I\'ve ever had.  Hmm.  What is? Oh my God, I\'m glad you asked.  Okay, so you put giant magnets in the bumpers of all the cars so that every car repels every other car so there would never be any accidents! Except every single time you\'re at a red light and a car comes and bounces you out into the intersection and you get the shit T boned out of ya.  Thanks for the tampons.Before we begin, I want to make one thing perfectly clear to all of you.  The information you\'re about to hear is top secret.  Unauthorized publication or "leaking" of this information would be an act of high treason, for which you would be tried and convicted by a secret military tribunal and summarily executed.  So no, Miss Poovey, I don\'t think a selfie would be appropriate.    Okay I\'m not.  Jesus.    Why is she even in this briefing? She\'s not allowed to go on missions.  Because she always stows away somehow, as do Figgis and Dr.  Krieger, and Julia gluey Dreyfus over there.  So this time they\'re going on the mission, so we can contain them.  Well, unless the mission is a softball game   against Gary\'s olde town tavern   No, it\'s in which case I nominate Ray Pitcher.    You know what?   Not because it\'s black.  You know what? Lana, he\'s the one ashamed of his hand\'s heritage, not me.  I\'m not ashamed.  Pssst, Ray.  C C Call me.    Ooh, little "handingo" action.    Ahem.  Time is a bit of a factor here, so as much as I\'d like to spend the day murdering all of you, I\'m afraid we need to press on.  To wit, this is Dr.  Zoltan Kovacs.  Last night in Paris, someone we suspect the Russians attempted to abduct him.  A high speed chase ended in a crash, which left him in a coma with a blood clot in his brain.  Which matters because? Because since defecting to the West 20 years ago, Dr.  Kovacs has been developing a top secret process for molecular miniaturization.  Aren\'t they already pretty small? It doesn\'t miniaturize molecules.  The process can miniaturize anything down to sub microscopic size robotics, computers, video cameras, vehicles, Even human beings.    But   You maniacs! You stole it! You stole my idea! I\'ve been working on miniaturization for years,   damn you, years!   Krieger, those were shrinky dinks.  It\'s the same principle! It is absolutely not the same principle.  Well then I\'ve wasted my life.  And all of my good markers.  But how does it work, this process? You\'ll be given a cursory explanation   at the CIA laboratory in New Mexico.    Why? Well, I assume they needed a large building in a remote location with plenty of parking, and real estate is a lot cheaper out in the desert.    No, not why is the lab in New Mexico.    Why are you going to tell us how this super top secret shrink ray works? Because in less than 14 hours, you\'re all going to be miniaturized down to the size of bacteria and injected into Dr.  Kovacs.    Wait, what?!   Is that possible? What if we don\'t consent to be Dr.  Shrinkered? Well there\'s a carrot and a stick here, the carrot being an one time payment of $1,000,000 each.    And the stick?   The stick is this is your last chance.  You people have bungled every assignment the CIA has given you, so if you refuse or fail this mission, I will personally ensure that none of you ever works in espionage again.    Ohh!   I\'m just an assistant.    No likey.    Well it\'s normally the other way around, but this time, I think I definitely prefer the carrot.  Not dick, Pam, stick.  Carrot and stick! Yeah I know.  6x12   Drastic Voyage, part 1 Okay people, listen up.   We\'ve got an enormous amount of information to cover in a very short time in which to do it, so your undivided attention is of the utmost   Mr.  Figgis, may I help you?   Yeah, is there any reason why you can\'t just do regular brain surgery without a shrink ray? Yes, there is.  And, Mr.  Archer, may I help you? Yeah, why the hell would this guy   have an oil can in his   Elbow grease.  Wow, it\'s pun for the whole family.  That\'s racist!   You know what I don\'t have time for?   Mm, shopping for clothes? Your particular brand of bullshit.  I was trying to familiarize myself with the human body, Slater.    Yeah, you know what this is?   Your best gal?   You son of a   Slater! We do not have time for this.    After this is over, you and me.    Poop.  Why do you constantly antagonize him? I Oh my God! Cyril, are you jealous?   No, I\'m   I\'m gonna make it up to you, buddy.    Oh please don\'t.    Archer! If you\'re done trying to win votes for class clown More like most handsome.    I was voted best milker.    Me too.  Ew.  Please direct your attention to Dr.  Kovacs\' assistant, Dr.  Sklodowska.    It\'s Sk wuh doh fska.    I\'m sorry.  What\'d I say? I don\'t know.  Something else.  Welcome, all of you, and thank you for volunteering for this mission.    Albeit under threat of death.    Due to boredom.  Come on! Let\'s get shrunked up already! First we need to cover some basics.  Now as you may or may not know, Dr.  Kovacs and I are lovers.  If that is shocking to you, so be it.  That\'s not shocking at all.  This is Dr.  Kovacs\' brain, home to the greatest mind in the history of mankind, if not the universe.  This is the blood clot that threatens to destroy that brain.  But we will destroy the clot with the Nereus.  Dibs on captain.  Dibs on driving! You have dibs on neither.  Mr.  Gillette, who is a licensed pilot, will be piloting the Nereus.  Oh so I\'m good enough to drive y\'all around? Great.  Maybe on the way, we can stop off down the piggly wiggly.  When this is over, I really think you and I should have a nice, long talk.    I\'m sorry.  Am I forgetting my place?   Little bit.  After being miniaturized, the Nereus and its crew will Yes, Mr.  Archer? Yeah, I think I should at least be co captain.  I\'ve had astronaut training.    So what? So did I.    So did most of us.  Yeah, but you sucked at it.  You kept puking your guts out on the   the   Don\'t say it.  the vomit comet.  But I kicked total ass in zero gravity, so I think I should be in charge.  What the hell are you talking about? I know how to do it be weightless.    So?   So when we\'re floating around in this Kovacs guy, in the submarine Have you ever seen a submarine movie? Oh my god, "Operation Petticoat," "Das Boot," "The enemy below," "Run silent, run deep", uh "Gray lady down"   Ooh, "Yellow sub"   "Yellow submarine," yes! Wow, there\'s so many submarine movies.  And in any of them was anyone on board any submarine weightless? fat joke? Yeah, plus that time we were all on a submarine   and were not weightless?   Oh, right.  Uh, but this time we\'re gonna be tiny.  After being miniaturized the Nereus with the mission team onboard will be injected into Dr.  Kovacs here, as close to the blood clot as possible.  This is because we only have exactly 60 minutes before the process wears off and we revert to normal size.  Sixty minutes exactly? Yes, I feel like I was very clear on that.  Our progress will be tracked in real time   on a 3 D map of the human body   Ta da! Oh my god, Slim Goodbody.  No! No, this is absolutely not that trademark character.    This is   Michael? Oh my god.  Just a unitard with the systems of the human body on it.    On a guy.    On a guy named TV\'s Michael Gray.    What?   Earballs! Jesus! I see I have some fans in the audience.    Are you kidding?   Are you? Lana, it\'s TV\'s Michael Gray.  Billy Batson, from "the Shazam/Isis hour?" Well, and "the Brian Keith show. " Obviously in "the Brian Keith show. "   Who is Brian Keith?   Now you\'re just trying to piss me off.  So what\'s up? W What have you been doing?   As you see, my good sir.    Uh CIA puppet shows?   Act ting, you philistine.    Michael, what are you doing here?   I   How did he even get on the base?   He said he knew you.    You let an unauthorized civilian onto a CIA black site just because he said he knew me? Well plus, he is TV\'s Michael Gray.  And as you may or may not know, TV\'s Michael Gray and I were lovers.  If that is shocking to you, so be it.  No.  I get it.  I think maybe you\'re confusing   the word, "shocking" with the word   This!   This is shocking!   No, that\'s just gross.  Which is also the word I think you\'re looking for   with your old man fetish.    Aw come on, they\'re not so That one doesn\'t even have skin! Okay if everyone will follow me into the miniaturization chamber, we will now begin boarding the Nereus.  Whoa.  Wait.  Already? Yeah.  Shouldn\'t we learn a little more about   the mission parameters?   Oh you absolutely should! But we\'re behind schedule, thanks to   TV\'s Michael Gray.    Whoo!   And   Scene! Yes.  We get it, Michael.  Scene! No, you ruined it.  Miniaturization will begin in 60 minutes.   Okay people, you heard the lady.  We\'ve got no time to lose, so here are your mission assignments.    Archer   Captain! No you\'re not.  Gillette is the pilot, and Cyril is the co pilot.  Well we\'ll see about that.  Go see about that.  Okay.  Pam and crazy glue, your job is to stay out of everybody\'s way, so maybe go do that in the rear.  What, like, butt sex?   Of the ship.    Well let\'s keep an open mind.  And a closed mouth.  How about that?   Mmm.    Just go.  Okay.  Lana, you think you can help Dr.  Sklodowska   with the navigation?   Well I did get an "A" in college biology.  Oh wow, great.  So when we\'re traversing the occipital lobe, you\'ll know what to do if the ship is in imminent danger of phagocytosis by polymorphonuclear leukocytes? It actually might\'ve been an A minus.  Okay maybe just help Archer with the laser   if he ever gets out here.    Ow! You two head up to the laser turret and get acquainted with that bad boy.  Jesus H.  Christ, Ray! Speaking of "H", do you see me in a sort of Leonard H.  Bones McCoy type of role, or   Meaning?   Irascible on board medical officer.    Mm yeah, I wouldn\'t say on board.    Oh man! So not only am I not going to tiny town, now I have to execute a guy?   What are you talking about?   This big, meaty bastard right here.    What are we doing, lethal injection?   Are you this is Dr.  Kovacs.    This is? Are you sure?   Yes.  Because even a first year phrenology student could see that this man is a cold blooded murderer.  Phrenology? Who are you, George Combe? Man, I wish.  Because now I probably have nerve damage.  I\'ve decided to let Ray drive.  With his racist robot monster hand! Hand, legs, feet.  I am a monster! Oh now come on.  You\'re not a monster, you\'re just different.  Come on.  It could be a lot worse.    How?!   Well I guess the hand, or the tissue covering the bionic part, it would be, I guess.  You know, could\'ve come from a serial killer.  And then one day soon, maybe you\'re shaving, and you find out it has a mind of its own.  It\'s a force of pure evil, and it starts dragging you out into the city at night.  Just cats at first.  But once the hand gets a taste for killing, it\'s only a matter of time before you\'re out there strangling male prostitutes, and then posing them in grotesque and horrific parodies of Mentos ads.  You know, the freshmaker.  In which case, I guess try to remember   I was always kind to you.    Not always.  Miniaturization will begin in 30 minutes.  And besides, I don\'t think Ray\'s hand is the one that\'s racist.    Shock.  Nothing.    What? So, listen.    I can\'t.  I\'m swiveling.    Yes you can, Archer.  I need to talk to you about something important.  Lana, what\'s more important than blasting imaginary womp rats in my imaginary T 16 back home?   Your infant daughter.    Oh right.  Sorry.  What\'s up? Well A: this mission feels fairly dangerous and totally half cocked.  That\'s normally cock aplenty.  Shut up.  And what if Kovacs dies, and the CIA disavows us, and we\'re blacklisted   from intelligence work?   I\'d have a lot more free time? So your entire career, your entire personal identity as a spy gone.    Maybe I finally learn to fly fish.    That\'s great, Archer.    What if we die?   I\'d have a lot more free time? Well if we do die, I just want to reiterate that my parents are gonna be A. J. \'s legal guardians, not Malory.  Okay.  A: you\'ve made that hurtfully clear about a jillion times.  B: Ava Jean could do a lot worse for a guardian.  Really? Jesus Christ! I I\'m sorry.  I didn\'t see the child.  Hmm? Oh she\'s fine.  She\'s used to it.    Really?   "Then the mama bear said, "\'well somebody\'s been eating my porridge. \'   And then the baby bear said "   Are you out of your goddamn mind?   What?   What?   I just had the drapes cleaned!   And then papa bear said, "Yeah? You just keep it up because this town is crawling with goldilockses with hot, young bodies and daddy issues. " Exactly.  Like what\'s her face at work.  Debbie, yeah.  And as far as I\'m concerned, the sooner she learns about cigarettes, the better.  This little pudge pop\'s going to need all the help she can get in the battle of the Bulge.  And C: even if, god forbid something happens to you,   I\'m gonna be fine.    So if, say, there\'s a malfunction with the shrink ray and the ship, and everything in it   gets vaporized?   I\'d just jump out at the last second.  While every single atom and molecule in your body is being destroyed? Uh, no.  I already jumped out.  It\'s this new thing called cat like reflexes? So can you seriously not even grasp the concept of your own mortality?   Lana, nobody can.    Really? Except maybe bears.  So will you do everyone a favor and relax for once? Nothing bad\'s gonna  Sorry, gang! My bad.  That was on me.  Hey, somebody roll that guy around.  He\'s smoldering.  Miniaturization in   You were saying?   I don\'t know.  ten minutes.  Probably something about Paris.  Miniaturization in five minutes.   Roger that, mission control.  Navigation systems are online.  We are ready for miniaturization process.  Copy that, navigation.  Bridge is online and we are ready for miniaturization process, over.    Said your dick.    That would mean it\'s too big, dummy, and so it\'s ready to be made smaller.  Damn it.  Turret, are you ready to begin miniaturization? Over.  Yes, if Lana, you good?   Yes.    We\'ll be fine, all right?   A. J.  will be fine.    Just remember what we talked about.  You already forgot.  Bears.  Turret ready.  Roger that, stupid.  You guys ready to make history? I\'m ready to make a million dollars.  Close enough.  Okay, let\'s light this candle.  What are you doing?   He said light the candle.    Not an ear candle! Well you won\'t bleed him, you won\'t cup him, you won\'t divine his humors.  For all you charlatans know, this poor man is both phlegmatic and bilious.    Get out.    Gladly! So, hey, do I need to swipe a keycard, or Ow! Paging Dr.  Dickwads.  All clear.  Commence initialization sequence.  All clear.  Mission control, this is Nereus.  We are ready for miniaturization, over.    Speak for yourself, holy shrink snacks.    Yeah, this is kind of terrifying.  So why are you messing around with this crazy shrink ray?   It\'s not like you need a million bucks.    Wh Are you kidding? It\'s not about the money.  Pam, we are going on a voyage of medical discovery unparalleled in not only the history of mankind but also perhaps its future.  Hippocrates, Galen, Percival, Sharpe.  For thousands of years, physicians have dreamed of having the power to see what we\'ve been given the chance to through this truly awe inspiring process of miniaturization, which I think you\'ll agree, is the very embodiment of Arthur C.  Clarke\'s third law, which states that any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.  Or, if you like, a miracle.    I   Plus I\'m going to use the money to buy an orphanage, and then bulldoze it.    Why?   Shits and grins and screams.  Wah, porridge, wah Well maybe she\'ll die.  Commence miniaturization in ten   Nine Eight   Lana?   Seven Six   Lana, calm down.    Five Four   You\'re making me really hard.    Three Two   Goddamn, dude.  One.  Wait.  What happened?   It It\'s gone.  Hang on.  Mission control to Nereus, over.   This is Nereus, control.  How wonderful.  Miniaturization complete, over.    Whoo!   Oh my god.  Time.  Okay, people, we have one hour to save Dr.  Kovacs.  And then hopefully a lifetime to be with him.  Once he leaves Hilda.  Control, I think we\'re ready to start   transport and injection, over.    Roger that, Nereus.    So, should we be steering, or   Shh! Okay.  Now the submarine is in a saline solution in the syringe, which the robot will now gently transport into the surgical theater, where it will prepare to inject the solution into the cerebrospinal fluid at the base of Dr.  Kovacs\' skull.    We\'re not weightless!   Why not? And since we only have 59 minutes ish until the Nereus reverts to normal size.  It is crucial that the injection be as close to the blood clot as humanly  well, robotically possible, I guess.  We\'re looking good down here, control.  All lined up on the injection site.  Roger that.  Nereus, are you ready? Ugh! Yes! Let\'s get this over with! You are a go for injection, doctor.  Preparing to inject.  So should there be screaming? Shh! Control, we\'re hearing some screaming.  Which what\'s the story on that? What in the name of sweet jiminy Christ do you think you\'re doing? Standing up for myself! Because maybe I didn\'t go to some fancy pantsy Ivy League med school, and maybe I didn\'t go to some other med school, even the one down in Grenada, which was my fallback, but whatever.  That doesn\'t give you the right to bully me.  I have had it! Oh, and by the way, if I was a clone of Adolf goddamn Hitler, wouldn\'t I look like Adolf goddamn Hitler?   Huh.  I never thought about that.    Doctor?   What?   Not you.  Doctor, please tell me that Nereus was injected into Kovacs?   It was.    Whew, okay.  So we\'re still okay.  I\'m sorry.  I should\'ve finished that thought.  It was injected into Dr.  Kovacs, but not at the injection site.    What? Well then, where is it?   His foot.  Wow.  Now I feel like Dr.  Dickwads.  Krieger, shut up! And you, get them out of there.  We can\'t.  They\'re way too small.  They\'ll just have to make it to his tear duct like we planned.  Is there enough time to make it to the clot,   laser it, and still escape?   I mean, it will be close, but maybe.  Damn it! So do we tell them? Well they\'ll find out soon enough.  And in the meantime, I\'m sure Sterling has everything well in hand.  Goddamn it.Nereus to Mission Control, over! Because look around! Does this look like the brain to you? No! Oh.  I was gonna say "yes. " We are clearly not in the brain! Look around, we are surrounded by   Whoa!   What the shit?   What the hell?   Ooh!   Sorry! Surrounded by muscle fiber Just think if I ever worked out.  Ya done? Hm? Oh! Well, I was saying that look at all that muscle fiber, out there, so we\'re obviously not in the brain, so   so where are we, and follow up   Nereus to mission control     What is with the rubbing alcohol?   Uh, I\'m making room for Tang.    Nereus to   What? What Tang? The Tang on which I\'ve got dibs, so   Why would there be Tang? Goofy Grape then, whatever! Lefty Lemon? Lana, this is serious.  If our electrolytes get out of balance   Archer, we\'ve only got 57 minutes until the sub reverts back to normal size   Killing Dr.  Kovacs   and permanently ending your checkered careers as intelligence agents.  We get it.  So your electrolytes can wait.  Well, you say that So tell us what to do, how can we help you find out where we are? Well for starters, he can quit futzing around with the radio and get   This is Mission Control, over.  You were saying? Goosebumps Really wish you\'d quit dicking around.  I know.  Mission Control, what is our twenty? The injection was botched Krieger asshole Ew! Shh! No! Ew! Say again, Control, what is our twenty? It appears you\'re in Kovacs\' left foot.  His left foot? Oh, well that\'s good, right? How is that possibly good? Well, relative to Krieger\'s asshole.  And to this.  Seriously, where do you keep the fruity drink powder? I\'d even take Rootin\' Tootin\' Raspberry.  How noble.  Well, no, I\'d still bitch about it.  And I think I\'ve earned that right.  What\'s wrong, why aren\'t they moving? Who knows? Their radio\'s damaged.  Maybe the propulsion system is, too.  Nereus, this is Mission Control   Oh, for the   they know who it is! If I were to make a list of things I\'m not in the mood for right now   That would be second on said list.  What is it, does she need to be fed? Wants, maybe.  I wouldn\'t say "need. " She\'s about to pop out of that onesie.  She seems like a normal baby weight.  Oh, yes, and everyone deserves a trophy just for showing up, and everyone\'s Kickstarter has merit.  Pff.  Okay people, listen up! We\'re bailing! What\'re you   Archer, if you bail on this mission, your career is over! Oh, eat several dicks, Slater! Your people shot us in this guy\'s foot, not us! Well? Are we bailing or not?   Yes!   No! Oh, my God Seriously, shit or get off the pot.  Ya know, on the farm it was actually a pot, likeit was literally a pot.  I have absolutely no response to that.  Because forgetting, for the moment, that Dr.  Kovacs will die if we don\'t laser that blood clot, how   With the laser, we cut a hole in his foot, zrrp, and slide on out, flrrp.  It\'s basically the old zrrp and flrrp.  Archer, we\'re the size of a bacteria   Bacterium.  Thanks, Jill Nye   Zrrp.  So no one could see us   until 48 minutes from now, when the sub reverts back to normal   Killing not only Dr.  Kovacs, but everybody else in the room.  And we can reach the clot in time! How? To get from his foot all the way to his brain would take, like   literally one minute.  I\'m sorry, I think you mean figur   Literally.  That\'s how long it takes blood to cycle through the body, so     Seriously?   What? Yeah, that doesn\'t sound right.  Well, we could ask Wikipedia Good luck, I\'ve got negative one bars.  Or we could just ask me, the woman who graduated from Harvard Medical School summa cum laude.  With a minor in Spanish bragging A   that was Latin.  He knows.  And B   we just have to laser our way into one of these veins here.  Flurp! Wait, no; zurp! Then the blood flow will take us into the inferior vena cava, then up through the right atrium, tricuspid valve, right ventricle, pulmonic valve, pulmonary artery, into the lungs, pulmonary veins, left atrium, mitral valve, left ventricle, aortic valve, aorta, common carotid artery Internal carotid artery, and then I can probably find it from there.  So if the blood flow will take us right to the clot, what\'s the catch? The catch is that we\'ll be going between three and four miles an hour.  Big whoop? No? Nobody? Oh, shit If we\'re the size of a tiny germ Yes, to us it will seem like   Making the jump to hyperspace? If by "hyperspace" you\'re referring to the film "Star Wars" and not bosonic string theory, then   Shh.  There\'s enough room in the world for science and miracles.  Okay people, listen up! When we go into that vein we\'re gonna get hit with about ten G\'s.    Buckle up!   No! Just kidding.    That\'s a lot of G\'s.    Oh, so suddenly you don\'t have a death wish? Lana, I\'ve never had a death wish.  It\'s just that I don\'t believe that I personally even can die.  Wow Although I do believe in ghosts.  Not sure if that\'s related, or Guess I better put these away since they\'re tungsten, and insanely sharp.  Yeah Should you even have those? I shouldn\'t even have yarn.  And I should not have volunteered for this.  So, I saw you coming on to Archer   Look, I\'m a sexual being.  If that is shocking to you, then so be it.  It\'s not, I was just gonna tell you he\'s had the clap so many times it\'s more like applause.  Uh, what was that? I said, ready on that laser? Duh.  Then fire at   will.  Great.  Okay, Gillette, now just slip it in nice and easy I mean what about "That\'s what she said"? Can we at least do that? Hush! Here we go, people! God, I will be glad when this is over.  Yeah, and when it is, I think you really should apologize to Lana.  For what? For being so racist about your hand! Wh  ? Racist? Yeah, all that Driving Miss Daisy stuff, and the piggly wiggly, and the   Oh, my God! I was mad because it\'s a robot hand, not because it\'s black! Hang on! Oh.  Because it totally seemed like     I gotta go tell her!   No, no, no! Waa! Ugh, are you crippled again? Yep.  Well, cheer up, buddy.  Maybe Krieger can get you some black bionic legs.  Just like Jesse Owens! Who may or may not have been a robot.  Although I might be thinking of the Jetsons\' maid.  Wait, was she black? What do you mean, he\'s crippled? Differently abled, whatever! No, we can just go with crippled Then who\'s steering the ship? I am! Now\'s the perfect time Not like you haven\'t dreamed about it Just crash the sub and kill them, Cyril.  Okay, Cyril? Hm? Yes? Over? We\'re through the heart now, and we need to get to the carotid artery, so on my mark, turn hard to starboard.  And refresh my memory, starboard is   Mark! Now on my mark, hard to port! And that\'s  ? Mark! Ah! Okay, this is it Wow, guess it does just take a minute.  So they\'re in the brain now? Well, we\'re assuming they are.  We have to wait for them to tell us their location.  The sub is too small to track with our current technology.  Maybe the CIA should do a Kickstarter.  Can someone please get that child some food! Oh, all right, she can have One cocktail onion.  Okay, there\'s the blood clot.  Fascinating.  Ugh! People\'s bodies are so gross.  Well, some people can\'t help it! Wh  ? Not you, Pam.  I was talking about Ray.  Seriously, you\'re like filet o\' man.    Ya know   Time to deminiaturization   40 minutes.  So hey, if you\'ve got this I\'ve always got everything.  Then I\'m gonna go check on Ray.  Oh, tell him   no, never mind.  No? You don\'t have a pun based little zinger about walking, or   No, I\'m actually kinda worried he\'s gonna kill himself.  Laser turret, prepare for thrombolysis.  Uh is there a knob for that, or   It means destruction of the thrombus.  Uh The thrombus is the blood clot! Oh, duh Yes, obviously you\'ve got this.  All right, Archer, you have to be sure not to let the laser detach the thrombus from the artery wall.  The last thing we want is an embolism.  No shit, that\'s my third biggest fear.  That\'s an aneurysm.  Okay, fourth biggest, whatever.  Archer, focus.  We\'ve got less than Oh, shit.  And even less than that until we\'re out of oxygen.  Wait, what? O2 consumption\'s about 12 percent higher than it should be That\'s like an entire Extra person.    A person called   What the  ? God damn it, Michael! TV\'s Michael Gray.  You ruined it.  And also please let me out.  No!   Uh, what\'s going on?   Well, TV\'s Michael Gray is on board, for some reason.  What? Mikey Mike! And where are you two going? Up there, to gawk at TV\'s Michael Gray.  And, we\'re taking these razor sharp tungsten knitting needles with us.  What about Ray? He can\'t come, he\'s crippled.  Lana! And also physically.  What the  ? Wh  ? Cyril! Can you see where we\'re going with your head up your ass? That wasn\'t me, we\'re not even moving! It\'s leukocytes! White blood cells! Agh, they must think we\'re bacterium! Well, let\'s see how they like having a laser beam blasted up whichever part of the leukocyte is the asshole.  Um, Alex, I think my buzzer\'s broken.  Goddammit! The laser capacitors are damaged! Is that bad? What do you think? That you\'d better watch your tone? I\'m so sah hah hah hah reee And I accept your apology, but, honey, I need to go see what\'s going on It\'s God\'s wrath! For lettin\' my self loathing about my ever increasing bionics make you think I\'m a racist! Well, I don\'t know about God\'s wrath, but   Oh but you will, Miss Unwed Mother.  Okay.  Ow! Hey, one of those leukocyte things just blobbed all over the windshield   Cyril, shut up.  What\'re we doing? Suffocating! Oh, sorry, Mikey Mike No no no, don\'t let him   Ta da! I think sometimes you oversell it, buddy.  Great, now we can all suffocate.    Excuse me?   We only had enough oxygen for eight crew, not nine, so thanks to TV\'s Michael Gray, we\'re low on oxygen.  Why is he here? What? Are you kidding me? Dammit, Michael Gray, it\'s bad enough we\'re getting devoured by leukocytes! Well, what do you want me to do, transform into Captain Marvel and save the day? I\'d be happy if you could transform into Jackson Bostwick! S sorry.  I guess I had that coming, huh? Will you explain that to me later? I was gonna ask you to.  Time until miniaturization   Okay, so we\'ve got   30 minutes.  Thanks, and since the laser\'s all jibbered up Someone will just have to go out there in scuba gear and use this portable laser to destroy the clot and fend off attacking leukocytes.  And I guess that someone is me.  Us.  I\'m going with you.  Oh my God, Michael, it\'s over.  Stop trying to impress me! And also no offense, but you\'re tiny.  But, Archer, somebody has to watch your back.  Well that somebody\'s not gonna be A. J. \'s mother, so Slater.  No way, you\'re just gonna frag me! I totally was.  Okay, so Pam.  Yay! Well don\'t rub it in TV\'s Michael Gray\'s face! Sorry.  Oh, fuck you.  Time to deminiaturization   15 minutes.  Because who takes 15 minutes to put on a damn wetsuit? Who has an entire submarine with no damn talcum powder on board? And Archer, remember, do not let the leukocytes touch you.  They\'re   Macrophages.  Yeah, got it.  What\'s that mean? It means they\'ll slowly turn your entire body inside out and devour every single cell you\'re made of.  Holy snacrophages.  Oh.  I thought it was a type of wizard.  Hey, you guys wanna take my needles? What? No, why would we want those? They\'re tungsten.  Move.  Archer, listen to me, I know you think you\'re invincible.  Plus now I have a laser backpack.  But you\'re a father now   With a laser backpack.  Shut up.  And please be careful.  No.  To both.  Woo hoo! Leukocytes! Thirteen minutes to go And just to reiterate, if your people fail   We\'ll never work in espionage again.  Yes, you\'ve made that perfectly clear.  Maybe we can live on all the prize money she wins as a competitive eater.  So, how are they doing out there? About like you\'d expect, from Archer.  Woo! Eat that, you stupid macrophage! There\'s another one, nine o\'clock! Oh, my God, I could do this all day.  Well since we don\'t have all day Shut up! Coming up on 12 minutes.  Will we have enough time to reach the extraction point on his tear duct? We should.  From here via the optic nerve should only take 90 seconds, then another 60 to the tear duct.  So we even have time to make love.  What? Sex.  Inside my lover\'s own body.  It would be the ultimate cuckold.  Ew, no! Lady, you\'ve got problems.  Plus TV\'s Michael Gray is staring right at us.  Okay, that was the last one for now.  Keep a lookout while I zrrp the clot.  And remember, you have to make sure it doesn\'t break free from the   What was that? Sorry, I couldn\'t hear you over the sound of me thrombolyzing the shit out of that thrombus.  Well? Are you just gonna stand there and gloat? Technically, Lana, I\'m floating.  It\'s basically the old float and gloat   Get back to the ship, you asshole! Okay, but only because I choose to.  Archer, look out! Wh  ? And also because it seems like the prudent course of action.  Time to deminiaturization   10 minutes.  Dammit.  Okay, get ready for the extraction.  Get ready how? We don\'t even know if the sub is in his tear duct yet! So go get an eyedropper, and for the next 10 minutes just keep eyedroppering out his tears and moving them into the hangar! Scoop out his whole damn eyeball if you have to! Oh no no no no, we wouldn\'t do dat, would we? No, dat\'s a meanie bo beanie Okay, door\'s closed! Hit it! Alright, we\'re in, purging airloc   No, no, no, no, no! I\'m sorry, what was that? The ship cannot move   while the airlock is purging.    Oh.  Uh, kinda seems like a design flaw We could start drinking it.  That would save like, two seconds! Well, plus I\'m pretty thirsty.  Pam, it\'s blood.  I\'m pretty thirsty.  Time to deminiaturization   eight minutes.  Okay, Cyril! You have to be ready to go the second that the airlock is clear! Clear? Yes! Yes? Yeah, what could possibly go wrong Okay, this eyedropper\'s full! Here! Go! Move! Dammit, gimme another eyedropper! Time to deminiaturization   seven minutes.  6 minutes.  5 minutes.  4 minutes.  Three minutes to deminiaturization.  Airlock purged.  What\'re we doing? Go, go, go, go! Ah! Eyedropper! Okay Cyril, here comes the optic nerve! Now hard to starboard! Hard to starboard! Two minutes.  Exciting, huh? Yeah.  Shut up! Oh, right.  There\'s the tear duct! Hard to port! Hard to port!   Eyedropper!   One minute.  Holy shit, we\'re gonna make it! Wait, are we gonna make it? Or are "we" justtoo broken? Michael Seriously.  Look look, there\'s a bright light! Yes! We\'re approaching the eyeball! Thirty seconds.  Eyedropper! So yeah, we shower it up, and then wherever the town is, we go find a sizzler or whatever   me, Lana, you and TV\'s Michael Gray, double date   and the flrrp   get shitty on rib eyes and scotch.  Mmkay.  10 seconds.  Nine, eight, seven Oh, that\'s it.  Six, five Go, go, go   get out of here! Four, three, two, one.  Begin deminiatur   Huh.  Guess we didn\'t make it But   so, is there a steakhouse around? Oh, and do they have flowerpot bread? All right, so now listen   No, no, no, no, I will not listen, because you no longer exist in my world.  So take this unlucky baby while I focus on the two positive aspects of this debacle, the first being that you people will no longer be a stain on the escutcheon of the clandestine services, and   No, please! You can\'t blacklist us.  This is all I\'ve ever known, it\'s   Shh! The second positive is that even though Dr.  Kovacs is dead, his miniaturization process lives on in the memory banks of the supercomputer Woo! Shrinky dink that! Krieger out! Which Dr.  Kovacs conceived and built the magnum opus of what was surely the greatest mind of his generation.  And so you work your whole life for something, for a cause, and in the end what do you have to show for it? No parade, no statue, no medal of freedom, no songs of heroic deeds Just an ulcer and you, dear Who I honestly think just gave me a hernia.  Well, if you fed her, like you said you did, why is she still hungry? Who knows with her? A tapeworm? And after that disaster, you\'d all better get used to being hungry.  At least until I can find a way to get us back in with the CIA.  Why bother? Excuse me? Well, look, I can\'t speak for Archer   And yet   but I don\'t want to risk my life on shady missions for those assholes at the CIA.  I have a child to raise.  So do I! Well, not And besides, they obviously set us up.  They\'ve always wanted us to fail.  Why would they   Why would you wanna work for those Ivy League white shoe D. C.  pricks? That\'s not who we are! We\'re the outsiders, the scrappy underdogs! We\'re Delta House, the Dirty Dozen, The Rebel Alliance.  The Commitments! Yeah! Woo hoo! We\'re the Bad News Frickin\' Bears, and our Lupus is an openly gay cyborg dying of sepsis in a wheelbarrow! Woo! That\'s us! I do think he\'s actually dying, though.  So why would you want to go back to being the CIA\'s   sorry, but   bitch? Because, you peawit, what are we going to do for money? Well I actually have some thoughts on that.1 [radio chatter]  [chatter continues]  [man] Well, what do you think?  [whistles] I think that in my next life  I\'m gonna come back as a movie star.   Yeah, look out, gay porn.   Rimshot.  Yeah, that could be your name.   So what, some movie star lives here?  Veronica Deane.  Can you believe it?  No shit.  You like her?  What, as an actress or for this homicide?  Both.  Well, it\'s been a while  since I\'ve seen her in anything, but man,  she was incredible in Shanghai Moon.   Oh, my God, that dress.  Oh, bejeezles, right?  But as for Tennessee Tuxedo here, I want to talk to her.   See if she knows who tried to weight him down    with an ounce of lead.   Found it on the ground over there by the table.   Is it hers? Hard to tell with no serial number.   Probably why they put \'em on there.  Rimshot.   You should ask Veronica Deane  if her agent reps gay porn stars.   And maybe if she murdered this guy.   You got a real knack for this.  Thanks.   But the household staff says she hasn\'t been home since yesterday.   And him? They say that as of midnight  the pool did not contain a dead waiter.   Okay, so  let\'s get some unis on the gates,  front, backside, whatever.  Nobody in or out.   And while we wait for the M. E. ,  we\'ll go talk to the staff, maybe jog somebody\'s memory.   Rim Schott.  How was that funny?  No, as my gay porn name.   You know   [hums tune]  [deep voice] Rim Schott.   Right?  [fizzles]   [Archer] It\'s not that bad.   No, on the contrary, it\'s wonderful.   If you enjoy starving to death.   Oh, please, Mother.   The only thing you eat is cocktail onions.   I simply cannot believe  I let you talk me into this boondoggle!  Not just me.  Lana?  Okay, me too.  A little.   But only because the CIA blacklisted us.   Plus now with A. J.   I thought it would be safer than being a spy.   It\'s safer than being a librarian!  Three months and not a single client.   Oh, for   Mother, when the word gets out that Sterling Archer,  the world\'s greatest former secret agent,  has his own frickin\' detective agency    Which technically, you do not.   Because California is assholes.   What have I been saying? Something about bears.   Because what other explanation could there possibly be  for California deciding that a stupid law degree    And a B. A.  in Criminal Justice.   Shut up.  Somehow qualifies an otherwise total idiot  for a private investigator\'s license, but an entire career  as a secret agent does not.  Well, you\'re lucky they did,  or you, or Ray, or you, Lana,  couldn\'t work as an investigator under my license.   And I\'m sure that\'s the last time we\'ll hear anything about that.  Not.   And you can be sure that the minute  Wait, the second I qualify for my P. I.  license,  this is the Archer Agency.   Fair enough.  So let\'s circle back  when you have 2,000 hours of investigative work  certified by your licensed employer, who is me.   Cyril   And go!  [sighs] 2,000 hours?  At this rate   Mother, we will get clients.   All we need is one high profile case.   And some kick ass advertising.   Give me that.   Pam, if a single one of these has left this building,  I will personally sew you into a canvas bag  full of rats and throw that bag into the river.   I gotta go get my car smogged!  What river? It\'s a concrete slab.   The headline there was a bag of rats.   Here\'s a headline.  "Malory Archer bankrupt.   Feckless Son to Blame. " Look    And even if we get a case,  what, some cheating husband, fake whiplash?  The whole thing is just sogrubby!  Grubby? Grubby?! [woman] Excuse me.   When we were spies, you murdered the Prime Minister of Italy.   Prove it.  I can\'t!  Uh, excuse me? Because Krieger chopped him up,  and then we stuffed him in trash cans  all over four different boroughs.   Well, then.  Wait.  Four?  I\'m not schlepping to Staten Island  in the middle of the goddamn night.   Hey! [all exclaim]  Jesus, lady, earballs!  [clears throat] Is this the Figgis Agency?  Well, we\'re not married to that, but    Yes, we are.   And yes, it is.   Hello, Cyril Figgis.  Owner, CEO,  and fully licensed private investigator.   Veronica Deane.   [all react] The movie star?!  Ugh.  May we talk somewhereelse?  [Malory] Blackmail.  I\'m afraid so.   You see, my home was burgled recently,  and in addition to cash and some jewelry,  they stole a computer disk with, I suppose  you might call it, sensitive information?  It\'s nine o\'clock in the morning.   I\'m still on Eastern time.   [Lana] Archer.  It\'s lunchtime there.   Yesterday, a lawyer named Alan Shapiro contacted me.   He said he was in possession of the disk  and wished to arrange its return.   For a fee.   And the fee was?  I would think none of your concern.   But   Yeah, Lana.   Oh, Ellis Crane, the movie director.   So do you have any reason to suspect  your ex husband is behind this?  I have every reason.   Yeah.  Lana.   What?! But Mr.  Shapiro wanted to meet me  at his house, so I assume the disk is there,  presumably in a safe.   I want you to go there and recover it.   You mean steal it.  I mean    Lana, she can\'t steal what\'s already hers.   That\'s   Wait, is it double jeopardy?  [all] No.   The disk is rightfully mine,  and I will pay more than fairly for its return.   Well, um, for a case of this nature  our standard rate would be    Cyril! What?  Sterling! For God\'s sake, man.   Mrs.  Deane   [laughs] Ms.   [scoffing] Ms.  Deane isn\'t a standard client, Cyril.   She is a film legend.   And as such, she deserves our legendary service package,  which includes, um   Get me the disk,  and I will pay your agency $100,000.   [coughing]  Yeah, yeah   [clears throat]  Yeah, that\'s our rate for that.   This is Mr.  Shapiro\'s address,  and I want the job done as soon as possible.   And of course, it goes without saying  that this matter is strictly confidential.   Apparently not.  And conversely,  anything you think you may or may not have overheard,  regarding the Italian Prime Minister\'s murder and dismemberment    Alleged murder and dismemberment.   I couldn\'t care less, Mr.  Archer.   All that matters to me is that you return the disk.   Now, good day.   [door opening]  [door closes]  [all laughing]  Holy shit, $100,000?  I was gonna say $10,000.   [laughing loudly]  Oh, my God!  [sighs] Yeah, what were you gonna say, smart guy?  [continues laughing]  Nine!  [winding down]  [Archer] Okay, people, listen up.   This is our first case, and we\'re gonna crush it,  so listen up! These are your assignments.   Pam.  Hey, in case you\'ve forgotten,  the writing is literally on the wall,  and I give the orders around here.   Oh, I\'m so sorry.  Please, by all means.   Uh huh.  Um    Well, our   Okay.   Archer has your assignments, so listen up!  Truly inspiring, Cyril.   It\'s like Patton and Churchill had a baby.   Oh, and put me down for 15 minutes of investigative work.   That wasn\'t even 15 seconds!  15 minutes is the smallest manageable increment.   You dick! Hey, shut up!  You also dick! With just a hint of Oscar Wilde.   Mother, if you\'re not gonna help,  maybe you\'d be more comfortable in your office.   No, I\'m fine here.   I want to see how you\'re gonna crack the big case.   Mancy Drew.  [all snickering]  Okay, Pam, this is our target location.   [all chattering]  That\'s a nice house.   4220 Arroyo Canyon Road.   Find out everything you can about this house  from the public records.  Plat map, utilities,  building permits   Oh, and especially look  for any blueprints.  Oh, man!  Can\'t Cheryl do that?  I wanted to be the gruff but lovable driver,  mechanic, and maybe occasional muscle.   Like a folksy B. A.  Baracus.   Fine.  Carol, you\'re head of research.   I\'m on it.   How would one go about being on it?  Try the Internet.   And get everything you can on the owner,  a lawyer named Alan Shapiro.   I think it\'s safe to assume he doesn\'t eat shellfish.   Hey, not cool!  What? The fact that he\'s a Hollywood lawyer  doesn\'t automatically make him Jewish.   Eww, he\'s Jewish?  Probably, but that\'s not the point.   You can\'t say shit like that!  Wait a minute.  If you didn\'t know he was Jewish,  why\'d you mention shellfish? He\'s allergic!  You buttlicks.   That\'s why he made that big donation  to the stupid food allergy charity.   Oughta call it the Weak Bloodlines Foundation.   Lana, you and I will break into the house,  and since we can assume there\'s a safe    Ray? You care to join us?  [sighs] I guess, since we\'re hourly now.   Okay, you got comms, night vision,  infrared, alarm bypass,  suction cups, this crazy spray,  which shows laser beams, and just in case there\'s a guard dog,  you got doggy treats loaded up with tranquilizers, which I call    Wait, wait, wait   I got something for this    "Hush puppies" Uh, damn! That\'s better.   Duh.  And since the front of the house by the road is guarded 24/7,  you\'re gonna have to go in from the rear.   No.  You all took it for granted.   But the back hangs off a cliff, like,  a hundred feet above the canyon!  Which is why I invented the rocket propelled grappling hook!  You didn\'t invent that.   Ah, that\'s what the patent office said.   And how much is all this costing?  Oh, my God, Cyril.   You have to spend money to make money.   No! You don\'t! You just have to break into a safe!  [roaring whoosh] [laughing]  [all yelling, screaming]  Shut that damn thing off! Lame!  Well, what the heck is that thing?  Thermal lance.  For the safe!  Like Jimmy Caan used in Thief.   It\'ll cut through two feet of reinforced concrete  like non reinforced butter.   We don\'t need a thermal lance, ass.   Just a standard safe cracking kit.   Well, what\'s legendary about that?  You know, you guys could help.   Hey, you said you\'re the muscle.   And what are you doing here?  Pam\'s my ride home.  [sighs]  I can\'t even.  And Archer,  do you really need to do that right now?  Yes, I do.  Somebody left an entire palm print, Lana.   Do you realize what skin oil can do to the factory finish?  [laughs] You realize how ridiculous you are,  for buying that automobile?  [scoffs] What? Shut up, it\'s amazing!  Okay.  So we\'ll just follow you in the van,  and watch in amazement.  Haha!  Try to keep up!  So, my guess would be the fuel pump?  Great.  Shut your guess hole.  Oh, come on!  It\'s gotta be under warranty.   Right? [sighs] I don\'t know.   Warranty\'s in Italian.   [all laughing]  [grappling hook whooshes]  [Archer] Okay.  Make sure they\'re secure.   \'Cause they\'re our only way out of here.   [sighs] Oh, I was hopin\' T. C.  was gonna come pick us up in the chopper.   Ha!  Well, but he\'s gonna be busy flying around,  searching for your battered corpses,  only to find out later that all the coyotes left  was a pile of titanium gears and a shitty weave.   [gasps] First of all    This is not a weave! [giggling] Okay!  Well, it ain\'t a shitty one.   You should do the camera first.   I said do the cameras first!  [muttering]  I know, right? How awesome is it to be back,  doing what we\'re best at?  What? Robbery? It\'s not robbery, Lana.   It\'s burglary.  Or maybe home invasion,  if we run into anybody, which hopefully we won\'t, but  I\'m talking fieldcraft! Stealth! Teamwork!  Night vision, grappling hooks    Whatever the hell Ray\'s doing.   Well, it better be the cameras.  Ray, are you doing the cameras?  [softly] Yes, Lana, I was doing the cameras.   Okay, so cut the alarm and jam the cell phone signal.   And Lana? The locks aren\'t gonna pick themselves.   And meanwhile, you were doing  I\'m goin\' infrared, Lana.   [gasps, laughs] Holy shit!  It\'s just like Predator!  In 3 D! Ow!  [sighs] Give me 90 seconds on the lock.   Sixty seconds on alarm and phone.   [Lana] Not a competition.   Seriously, we were made for this!  We\'ll be out of here in no time.   Don\'t count your chickens before they\'re hatched!  Okay, A, I\'m pretty sure chickens give live birth, like sharks.   What the   And B, compared to espionage,  P. I.  work is gonna be a total cakewalk!  But I doubt they\'ve gotten the disk yet.   Don\'t you think it\'s a little premature to be celebrating?  Who\'s celebrating? We\'re out of liquor!  But I admit, I\'m cautiously optimistic.   Because out here, you can buy liquor at the grocery store?  Literally, the only thing about Los Angeles  that doesn\'t make me want to vomit.   But I\'m talking about this new line of work.   A good detective and a good spy share a lot of skills,  and I\'ll deny I ever said this,  but Sterling was an excellent spy.   So maybe we can actually make a go of this!  I mean, even Pam and Carol are showing some talent for it.   [Carol gasps] Oh, my God, Pam! I forgot to give  Mr.  Archer one of the public records that came back on that guy\'s address!  What? His license?  Well, I mean, it was kind of a license.   [ferocious growling]  Oh! Mother of    [laughing] Sweet Jesus! What?  [screams] Run!  No, no, no, don\'t run! I got them treats.   [screaming] Owww!  Bad dog!  Oww! Archer, lower your voice!    With what? We didn\'t bring guns.  What?  Oh, the treats.  Give \'em the treats.   Wait, no, hang on.  [kissing noises]  Treats! No, no, no, no, wait!  [screams]  [both gasping]  [Archer] Ugh! Ooh!  [together] Ooh.   [grunting, groaning]  [Lana] Well [dog groaning]  Aww, sleepy, babies.   Guess we oughta get crackin\'.   Rim shot! That\'d be a good porn name.   Mine would be "Lance Biggerstaff. "  I\'m picturing a gay wizard.   I always am.   [coughs, moans]  Eat a dick, gravity.  Aww.   No, I don\'t get this at all.   Maybe \'cause it\'s upside down.   Wait.  Really? Yeah, you\'re just kind of a hick.   Said the man with a relative called, "Uncle Paw Paw. "  [scoffs] That\'s \'cause he\'s my mother\'s  Yeah, no.  Never mind.   So what\'s the deal? How\'s that going?  [whispers] It\'s goin\' great!  And you talking is helping! So, what do you think is on that disk?  Uh, duh, sex tape!  Please.  She\'s like 100.  She\'s like 50.   And she\'s also Veronica Deane, you big jealous bitch!  [muffled] Archer?  Don\'t scream.  Because you have no reason to feel threatened  by Veronica Deane.  [annoyed grunt]  Am I attracted to her? Obviously.  I mean, come on.   You saw Shanghai Moon.   Oh, my God.  That dress?  [chuckles] Right.  I mean, yeah.   Maybe it was 20 years ago, but if anything,  she\'s hotter now   Oww!  Shh! Ow! Ow  How could you even tell if she was still hot?  She was basically just gigantic sunglasses and a big hat!  Trust me, Lana, she\'s still hot.   Oh, and the joke\'s on you, because if I have rabies, now you\'ve got it!  Uh, I don\'t think you want to get bitchy with me  about communicable diseases.   [scoffs] Crabs aren\'t a disease!  Oh, my God.  First of all [clattering]  So, if y\'all are done having your little post fight makeup sex fight    That\'s not what we do! [whispers] Oh, my God.   That is all you do! Now can we go, before Shapiro knows we\'re here?  How would he? Except for two sleepy grizzly bears,  we didn\'t leave  Aaah, intruder!  Intruder!  That\'s bullshit.  How did he know?  Guards! Yeah, but besides that?  Why didn\'t you tell us you were bleeding like a Russian princess?  Because I honestly didn\'t know! How could you not?  Because I took a bunch of painkillers at the office!  Why? [growls]  Because somebody left them out, Lana.   Move, you idiots.  They got the disk!  I am so angry at you right now!  Well, you shouldn\'t give me that power    [screams] Jump!  Whoo hoo! Painkillers!  There! Agh! Agh! Agh! Agh! Agh! Agh!  Well, I hope you brought enough painkillers to share with the class!  No.  I ate \'em all.  Because we\'re all gonna get shot.   Relax.  They\'re not gonna hit us with those suppressors on,  they\'d need a   Grenade!!  And with that having been said    Son of a bitch!  Why does a divorce lawyer have grenades?!  Ray, they\'re terrible people!  You assholes! If they live, you die.   Archer, what are you doing?  Getting you out of here.   Ray, get her to the van.   What about you? I\'ll be fine.   I lied, I got like, 20 more.  Go!  Hang on, honey.   [Lana shouting] Archer!  Wow, say what you will about cyborgs.   Sure can run good.   And I should take the fast way down too, so    [exhaling rapidly]  [screaming]  [Archer] Ow!  [grunting]  [shouting]  [Cyril] And now, Ms.  Deane    As promised, your computer disk.   And your cashier\'s check for $100,000.   And while I appreciate your firm\'s hard work,  I\'m sure you\'ll understand when I say  I hope we never meet again.   A feeling that I assure you is mutual.   Then I bid you good day and goodbye.   Yay! [grunts]  Lower your voice.  [whispers] Ow.   Oh, let her enjoy it, Sterling.   We just made $100,000! Well, minus expenses, which    Which reminds me we need to add an extra $1,200 to that.   For what? Something called a pompa di benzina?  Called it.  No, you didn\'t!  And while you\'re at it, add a case of champagne.   We deserve to celebrate.  [all gasping]  Ooh! Bubbly!  Damn it, Veronica Deane already left?  I wanted her to sign this head shot.   Ooh, Joan Crawford\'s gonna be so jealous.   You know what   [woman] Excuse me.   [all groaning]  [Ray] Oh, my God.   Is this the Figgis Agency?  Again, not married to that.  Yes, we are!  [chuckles] And yes, it is.   I\'m Cyril Figgis, owner, CEO,  fully licensed investigator.  And you are?  She\'s  She\'s My name is Veronica Deane.   [all gasping] Oh, goddamn it.   May we talk somewhere privately?  Wait a minute.  If you\'re Veronica Deane,  then who the hell was   [gasps]  [whispering] Ow.   I, um   Uh, that is to say, uh, it\'s uh    Such a pleasure to meet you.   May I ask how you heard of our agency?  My housekeeper found this under her windshield wiper at the supermarket.   [snickering]  His name\'s Furlock Bones.1 Blackmail?  Yes, I I\'m afraid so.   You see, last night, thieves burgled the house of my attorney, Al    Alan Shapiro.    Why, yes.   But how did you know that Mr.  Shapiro was my attorney?  Yeah, Cyril.   Oh.  Uh, so, the reason I know that is    He\'s an idiot.    Savant.  Photographic memory.   My guess is he read that in a newspaper  article years ago and never forgot it.   But, you know, many of the world\'s  great detectives were on the spectrum.   Wait.  What?  Sherlock Holmes, um, Darryl Zero  Please forgive me.  I had no idea.   Really? Look at his clothes.     Hey, you know what    There, there.   At any rate, um, whoever these  people were, they stole, um  My goodness, look at me.  I\'m I\'m shaking like a leaf.     Would you care for a drink?   Archer, it\'s barely nine o\'  Corpse Reviver #2, please.  But if you don\'t have real absinthe,  I\'ll have a double sidecar, French.   Oh, that sounds good.  I\'ll have    There\'s not enough.    You were saying?  They stole  Yes.  Um, I suppose you could call it  very sensitive information.   On a computer disk?  Well, yes, but surely you didn\'t  read that in the newspaper.   Intuition and a photographic memory.   It\'s remarkable, but it can be a bit  Off putting?  Cyril, get up.  Move.   Ms.  Deane came here for help, not to be off put.   Now, then, this sensitive information  Sterling!  Um, yes.  So, about the disk  You want to get back at us.     You want us to get it back.    No, Mr.  Archer.   I need you to get it back,  desperately.   Which is an excellent segue into a  brief overview of our fee structure.     Two hundred thousand dollars.    Wow, that was brief.   Payable upon delivery.   Now, if you will excuse me, I  I think we might have more questions.   I\'m sure you do, but Mr.  Shapiro will have to answer them.   He\'s waiting for you at his house now.     The house that got robbed?   "Burgled," Lana.  Pay attention.   And so, Miss Deane, do you want me to ride with you?  Because my car is currently    Merde.    No!  No, Mr.  Archer.  Mr.  Shapiro  will handle everything from now on.   And if all goes according to plan,  this will be the last time we ever meet.     Wait.  No.  Ever?   I am standing right here.   Yeah, exactly, when clearly we\'re almost out of triple sec,  so   Okay, so, what do we know?  Um, old ladies give you a boner?  Hey, me too.   No.  And shut up.  And, Krieger, come on.     Let\'s go.  Move.    Away.     Um   Wh    Oh, for the Ew!   What? My leg\'s asleep.     And you have an erection.    Also.  Yes.   And we have to meet Shapiro in two  hours ago, so can we please focus?  Well, we know that someone posing as Veronica Deane  tricked us into stealing a computer disk  in order to blackmail the real Veronica Deane.   And paid us with a bogus cashier\'s check  for a hundred thousand dollars, which    Why the hell are you doing that?   What?  You just said it was bogus!  I don\'t know.  Fingerprints?  Well? Who am I, Alphonse Bertillon?  Uh, so I\'m just gonna kind of power  through this, if you don\'t mind.   Whatever.  Jesus.   Okay, so, now, the real Veronica Deane  How do you know she\'s the real one?  Oh, she\'s definitely the real thing.   Please, you can\'t fake that desperate,  actressy craving for attention.   What you can\'t fake, Mother, is her  star power, her palpable charisma.   Well, I\'m gonna fake being here and  go pick up our daughter at daycare.   Well, then, you can fake getting paid.     Excuse me?   You\'re no longer on Malory\'s teat.     Ew!   Cyril!  Never gonna be able to stand up.   You work at the Figgis Agency now.   And around here, you don\'t work a the case,  you don\'t get a the the paycheck.   Boom! Fridge magnet.   I\'m sorry.  Did Veronica Deane  spray a bunch of pheromones  that somehow raised all your testosterone levels?  That is exactly what it feels like.   Oh, yeah.   I feel like I could fight a grizzly bear,  like, over a parking space.   Is the bear, like, standing in the  space or actually driving the car?    Doesn\'t matter.    I mean Really!  Does it matter that if we don\'t get  that disk for that snooty has been,  we\'ll have to shut off the lights?    How will that help?   Not to mention,  it\'s kind of our fault the disk  was stolen in the first place.   Since we stole it.  Okay.     Okay, so   Cyril, shut up.   Sterling and Lana, go meet  Shapiro and then report back.   Uh, before or after he recognizes us  as the people that robbed his house?  "Burgled. " And it was pitch  black, and we all had on goggles.   So calm down.  Nobody\'s gonna recognize us.   Duner! Blits! Keyn! Nit faynt!  Hey, buddies.   Nit faynt! Keyn! Keyn!    God, that is so weird.    Yeah.     Are they not housebroken, or   What?  No.  No.  Sorry.  No.  Come on in.   Oh, shoes.  Shoes, shoes.  Thank you.   No, the growling.  They have  never done that to a guest.   And they are extremely well trained.   Ex Mossad, actually.   But if you mean the diapers, then  yes, because whoever broke in here  And I say "whoever," because it was pitch black,  and they were wearing some kind of goggles    Called it.    when  they poisoned my goddamn dogs!    What?   Yeah, the vet thinks it  was some kind of tranquilizer.   But they had a bad reaction, and all night the poor things  were just crazy shitting, uncontrollably.   I mean, like fire hoses, seriously.   It was all through here, down that  hallway, all down the stairs.   Some got way up on that wall somehow.   And there was all this blood splashed  everywhere from the burglar.   I swear to God, it was like a  Family Circus cartoon up in here.   The ones where they follow Billy all around the neighborhood,  only with blood and watery dog shit.   And so, the maids cleaned all night.   That\'s only because I threatened to have them deported.   They\'ve been with me at least  Oh, wow.  Rosa\'s been with me 20 years.   Anyway, the vet just left.   They were so dehydrated.  We had \'em  on IV drips, the whole megillah.     The maids?   Th The dogs!  Oh, my God, I am so sorry  that that happened.   I\'ll tell you who\'s sorry, is my flokati rug.   Oh, and my worthless bodyguards.   Right.  And they are  Fired! And lucky they\'re not slowly  dissolving in a 50 gallon drum!  She trusted me!  Veronica trusted me to protect  the disk, and I failed her!  Okay, well, maybe.  But we\'re gonna  get it back, right, with a plan?  Yes.  I\'m sorry.  Those vermin called this morning,  gave me instructions on where to bring this  two million dollars in bearer bonds.   Holy shit, we should\'ve kept the disk.   Safe from the bad guys.   And by "we," obviously I meant "you. "  So  Wow.  Hurtful.   Okay, let\'s go meet these bastards.   Okay.  A, you won\'t need that.   And B, we need to check in with the agency.   Or roll with me we don\'t  check in yet, or at all,  which means we decide how many  hours we worked on this case,  and not Cyril, who, I hate to bring this up,  just this morning, in front of everybody,  made you his giant bitch.   Well, you two coming, or what?  Okay.  They said come alone, but I don\'t drive,  so they said I could bring my chauffeur.   So somebody gets a snappy uniform,  and somebody else gets to hide in the trunk.   I trust milady shan\'t be  overly discomfited whilst in the boot.   I bet you get this all the time, but  have you ever done any modeling, or  Oh, and just so you know, a woman chauffeur is a  ow  Chauffeuse,  you dumb idiots.   Wait.  What?  What do you mean, they haven\'t checked in?  Uhhh  I mean that  they haven\'t checked in.   Wha So no one\'s heard from them?    Uh uuhhh.    No o ope.   So we\'ve got two agents in the field  "Investigators"! I thought I  was very clear about that.   And also about how excessive spinning  causes premature wear on the bearings!    Cyril   And I bet they  haven\'t checked in,  because they\'re trying to stick it to  the man, who, in this case, is me.     And in this case only.    Stop spinning!    Cyril, you stop.    What,  protecting innocent bearings?    Being yourself!   What?  Ooohh!    Excuse me?   Cyril, you have been given  the opportunity of a lifetime  a new job, a new city where no one knows you,  which means you can reinvent yourself.   You can be anyone you want.   So why would you keep being you?  Huh.   And that goes for the rest of you.   Don\'t be the same feckless idiots you were  when this was a spy agency.   Oh, come on.  Just literally yesterday,  you were all so excited about your  first case, and now look at you.   So get off your collective ass and  get me a sit rep on my field agents!  "Investigators. "  I am, you know, still the boss.   Well, but only when I\'m not here.   Okay, I think we\'re here.   Do you? Do you think that, Lana?  Calm down, Fran Trunkington.     Forced.    Oh, for the    Trunky Brewster, then.    Ehh!  Oh, man, I hope that\'s not them.   Although that seems unrealistic.   Okay, Archer, we\'ve got nine check that ten bandits, 12:00.   Copy that, Mav.  What\'s the hard deck?  Okay, you know what?  Never mind.  Come on, Poppin\' Fresh.     Are you coming?   Are you gonna open my door?  I know, right? She\'s like  Ow!  So, are you and Archer,    you know?    Unfortunately.   You the Jew lawyer?  Yes.  Yes.  I believe  we spoke on the phone.     You got the money?   Yes.   Two million dollars in bearer  bonds, as per our verbal agreement.   What are you doing? Get the disk.   Oh, well, get a load of Miss Daisy.     Ehh.    Now, you give the  case to Ocho there,  and I\'ll give Miss Daisy the D isk.   You done?  Almost.  But I gotta ask    Where\'s the frickin\' money?   What?    Run!   What  Son of a  Man, I hope you got health insurance.   Look  Shut up!  The rest of you, mount up.   Sandy Trunkin.   Trunkin Hines.  Archie Trunker.   Ooh, Archie Trunker\'s Place.   Hmm.   That was quick.   Trunk  Trunkingham Palace  Trunkminster Fuller.   This is Lana Kane.  Please leave a  Five times, straight to voice mail!    Y\'all, that\'s not like her.    You think she\'s in danger?  Who knows? If they went to meet the  blackmailers, no backup, then  Aw, jeez, you guys are freaking me out!  Okay, so as distasteful as it may be,    you have to at least try him.    No! No.   I don\'t care if they are in danger.   I am not calling Sterling.   Voicemail hoax! Voicemail hoax!  I don\'t care if they\'re  getting stuffed into a wood chipper.   Huh? Wuzza? Oh, man.   We better be at a bar.   You, move the limo.  As matter of fact,    move it all the way down to Pearl\'s.    Aw, be a shame to crush it.   Yeah? Be a shame to crush your skull, too,  but these are the times we live in.   Come on, Miss Daisy.  Move that ass.   Son of a  Hello?    Wait for it.    Mother?  Oh, for Mother, it\'s me.   What the  Get out! No, no, no, no!  He\'s biting me!  Son of a bitch!    I\'m gonna cut you with that!    Kill him!    You\'re gonna die!   Oh, my finger!    I\'m gonna kill you!    Get him to the wood chipper!  Eat shit! I\'ll see you in hell!  No, no, no, no! Please don\'t!  No!  Please don\'t  No, you can\'t! You can\'t! You can\'t!  Sorry    No, no, no, no.  Hey!    What did I tell you?   Yeah, yeah.   Well, but you gotta hand it to him.   This was the best voice mail ever!  It would\'ve been.     It would\'ve been.     Ocho!  Mas tequila, pendejo!  Then we\'re gonna go have us a long  talk with Miss Daisy and the Jew.   So, would you say it\'s serious?  Ugh! I would, Alan.   We actually have a child together, so  Ew Oh, I meant, aww.   So, I would love it if you would shut up  so I can think of a way out of here.   Uh, wanna try yanking on the pipe?    Phrasing.    What the  Boom.  Deal with it.     Archer?    Aka Trunkmaster Flex.     Meh.    Oh, whatever.   And what happened? How\'d you  screw up a simple handoff?  Wha He didn\'t bring the money.   Senator Stay Puft, rebuttal?  I didn\'t bring it, because  because I don\'t have it.     Wha Well, who does?   I don\'t know.  Wall Street?  Creditors? The three different mortgage companies?  Whoever thought it was a good idea to start  a faux hillbilly restaurant chain called "Po\' People"?  Which was me, actually.  I\'ve given  her some terrible investment advice.   Wait.  Did you mean "Po\' Folks"?  No.  Those guys sued our dicks off.   Wait.  So, Veronica Deane is broke?  No.  She\'s  Oh, my God.  Is that what this is?  You\'re just intrigued by the idea of a sugar mama?    No, not at all.    Wait.  What?    What?   She\'s not broke.   But she doesn\'t have two million bucks for blackmail,  so I figured I\'d just bluff it,  and then you guys would take \'em down.     Why would you think that?   Come on.   I know who you guys are.   Okay.  Jesus.   Look, I am so, so sorry we made your dogs sick.   You what?    What?   It was you!  Jesus Christ! You broke into my house!    You stole the disk!   Ugh!  What were you gonna say?  That I know you used to be spies!  Ohhhh.     And assholes!   Stop.     St Stop it.  Stop it.    Ow!  Sorry, but we got duped.  We thought we  were stealing the disk for Veronica.   Oh, now you\'re on a first name basis.   And, again, seriously, about the dogs    Ow!   Well?  What is wrong with this thing? Why can\'t I dial out?  Because it\'s not Hey, wait.  Hang on.  Stop.   Stop.  You guys hear that?  My God!  He actually trained crickets.   No.  I think that\'s Jeezy Petes!    The line\'s still open!   What? What are you saying?    That\'s not Archer\'s voice mail.     Those are real life crickets!    So?   So everything we  heard really happened.   Well, what are we waiting for?  I\'m not giving you my pants.   Well, I won\'t proceed without pants,  Lana, and I can\'t wear his pants.   Yeah.  Plus, he\'s all dirty and bloody.   And it\'s not like yours won\'t fit me.   What is going on with your thighs?  Oh, my God.  They\'re jodhpurs!  No.  I know.  I mean lately.   I bet that would\'ve hurt even with pants.   Okay, you\'re gonna take the next exit.   We\'re only a few miles out.   And how are you tracking his phone?  Same way I track all of your Um, so,  you might even wanna start getting over now for that exit.   Bee boop.   Oh, get up, you big baby.   I honestly don\'t think I can.     Archer   Seriously, I was  already pretty exhausted.   Physically, obviously, I\'m  pretty sure I got stabbed twice.     Goddamn, dude.    But, man, emotionally?  It\'s been a long time since I killed anybody.   You killed some of the bikers?  They tried to wood chipper me!    No.  I meant   Although to be fair,  if you open what you think is an empty trunk,  and suddenly there\'s a guy in  there, you\'re gonna overreact.   Kind of like that time I walked into that  motel room, and it was full of seagulls.     Archer.     God.     Myrtle Beach is a train wreck.    Archer!  I don\'t know, Lana.  I may have.   I was in rampage mode.   I definitely knocked out, like, seven or eight, so    Goddamn!   Yeah.  Pretty beat.   So, is there any liquor back here?  Like, even cooking sherry, or  My point is, there\'s probably only  two or three bikers left out there.   So go beat \'em up.  Get the keys, get  the disk, and let\'s get outta here.   Already?  Don\'t you even wanna know who hired us for the handoff?  It was you!  You had the fake Veronica Deane hire us to steal that disk!  What? Get  Ow! No, it wasn\'t me.   I\'d never do that to Veronica.   If that disk gets out, she\'ll be ruined.   And I\'m And I\'m in love with her.   Of course you are.   Oh, don\'t be jealous, baby.   You and I will always have what we had.     Wait.  What? What?   Uh, so, who did hire you?  That\'s for me to know and you to find out.   Well, and for us to find out,  too, since we don\'t know, either.   Or why I said that out loud.   What we do know is that our cut  of two mil is ten percent.   So, unless somebody\'s got two hundred grand  burning a hole in their pocket, I  I have a cashier\'s check for that exact  amount, literally, in my pocket.   It was to pay these private dicks.   But if their actions  don\'t constitute breach of contract, then  Well, I\'ll just go ahead and take that.   I already got dibs.   And why the hell are you naked?  It\'s after Labor Day.   You ain\'t gonna get away with this.   I\'m gonna hunt you down, like Ow!  Tell it to the cops, shit bird.   Although obviously never speak to the  police without an attorney present.   Thanks for coming, you guys.     Oh, my tits, whaaat!   No.     We\'re back to saying "phrasing. "    I\'m not.   Well, apparently we\'re not saying "thank you. "  Thank you, Mother, for arriving.   Wait.  So, could Ray not be bothered?  He\'s outside, securing the perimeter.   Say I won\'t.   Good work, Ray.  Thanks for coming.   Oh, my tits, whaaat!  What are you wearing?  What are you wearing?  Thought I might have to go undercover.     As what?   A biker, dum dum.   It\'s just you look kind of gay.     I look gay.    A little bit.  Yeah.   Well, did you see Lana? Hey, Earl Campbell called.   He wants his thighs back.   Okay, so, first case pros and cons.   Well, we got tricked into blackmailing  Veronica Deane, beloved Hollywood icon.     Yeah, that\'s definitely a con.    But then we  Well, I totally kicked ass and got the disk back.   I will begrudge you a pro.   Although I didn\'t get to give it to her in person.     Maybe over cocktails.    Pro.   Also, we never found out what\'s on it  or what "Longwater" even means, so  Because it\'s none of our business!  Oh, and speaking of business,  Shapiro said he\'d recommend us to any  of his clients that might need PI work.   Ooh, the case of the missing kishke.   Oh, and I also got stabbed.   How is that a pro, you dick?  Learning experience?  Well, joke\'s on you.  I didn\'t learn anything.   There\'s your fridge magnet.   So, all in all, I\'d say our first case was  a bit of a mixed bag.   Oh, I don\'t know.   Two hundred thousand dollars for two days\' work?  That\'s not too shabby, people.   Two hundred thousand divided  by eight equal shares.   That\'s Holy shit snacks! 25 grand each?  Wait.  What do you mean, "equal shares"?  What do you think this is, a pirate ship?  Well, there\'s an easy way to find out.   Like, I assume there\'s some sort  of leather bound ship\'s registry  in the office of the Lord High Admiral.   Ugh! Fine! I\'ll find it myself.   Idiots!1 [Archer] Because she\'s two, Lana!  What possible difference could it make,  what pre pre school she goes to?  Because if A. J.  gets into pre pre at Country Day,  she\'s set through eighth grade.   Then she\'s basically guaranteed a slot  at any prep school in L. A. !  Yeah, but why prep school?  Are we not even considering public school?  Seriously?  Why not? And in summertime,  instead of a lemonade stand,  she could have a teeny little stripper pole, and    Malory! Mother!  Public school.   Might as well leave her by a dumpster at the county fair  and hope she\'s taken in by carnies.   Wow.  Yeah, Mother, good call,  I didn\'t know we were drinking.   We\'re not.  Because Country Day  gets a thousand applicants for ten spaces in pre pre.   Please stop saying "pre pre. " Shut up.   And A. J.  is going to get one of those spaces,  and you\'re not gonna screw this up for her, Archer!  [man] Archer? Swirling Archer?  [gasp]  Sterling! Archer?  [whisper] Ivy.   Dude, it\'s me! Ivy!  From St.  Josh!  Yeah, I, uh    [laughing]  Long time, no see!  What\'re you doing here? Checking out the toilets?  No, I\'m   I mean I\'m, I\'m, I\'m   [laughing]  [imitating] Wow, still got that stammer, huh?  I   Hello, Richard Stratton the fourth,  though my good friends call me Ivy.   Malory Archer.   Hmm.  Sterling never mentioned a sister.   Oh, you.  I\'m actually his mother,  if you can believe it.   I absolutely cannot.   Really? Hi, Lana Kane.  Hello.   So, Mr.  Stratton, are you a teacher here, or  [chuckling] Oh, God, no.   No, I\'m on the board.   And, Archer, you\'re in L. A. ? What\'s your line?  I   um   I\'m a   a private investigator?  [laughs] No, seriously.   No, seriously.   Wow.   [baby cooing] Oh.   And who might this person be?  This is our daughter, A. J.   We\'re here for a placement interview.   Our? Um  Ours.  As in mine and Archer\'s.   Yeah I\'m not the maid or the nanny.   Good for you.  Good for you.   Gosh, the times we live in, huh?  So hey, private investigator.   I might actually be able to use you.   Oh, well Really?  Unfortunately, I don\'t think  we\'re taking on new clients right now, so   [chuckles]  May I speak with you a moment, please?  What is this "no new clients" bullshit?  He\'s on the board, Archer.  One word from him, and A. J.  is in.   Yeah, but   Yeah, but shut up!  This is your daughter\'s future, you dickhead!  So you are gonna take his case, and you are gonna solve it,  and A. J.  is going to school here  and then grow up to be a titan of industry  or an astronaut or some other shit!  [baby cooing]  [sighs] Well?  [yelps] Yeah, okay, sure, glad to help.   Outstanding.  [chuckles]  My office, two o\'clock.  Yep.   Now, that wasn\'t so hard, was it?  She said, phrasing? Boom.  Huh?  Hey, what\'s happening? Are you okay?  No!     [woman] Mr.  Archer? Mr.  Stratton will see you now.   Mr.  Archer? Mr.  Archer.   Boop.  Sorry, had to take that.   Mr.  Stratton, I have Mr.  Archer.   [Ivy] Thank you, Cerise.   Holy shit I know, right?  Consider it crushed.  [chuckles]  Please, have a seat.  Oh, okay, thanks, uh  Have a seat.  Yep.   Ah, Swirling Archer.  Remember?  How we always used to call you Swirling?  Yep.  Because of all the swirlies.   Yep.  We were just merciless.   But I was a pussycat compared to Whitney.  Yup.   Yep.  You remember Trent Whitney, right?  Yep, he was, uh, actually worse.   He\'s the Whitney in Stratton Whitney.   Oh.   Hedge fund.  Mm.   You played lacs with him, right?  You were center middies.  Yep.   I was biathlon, obviously.   Probably could\'ve made the Olympic team,  but whatever, lame.  [chuckles]  And didn\'t you letter all four years?  No.  Just three.  Are you sure?  I am, yeah.  Freshman year I didn\'t make varsity  because that winter I was in the hospital for five weeks.   With what, AIDS? [chuckles]  Pneumonia.  From what?  Complications from AIDS? [laughing]  No, I actually   I actually got it  from one of those hilarious swirlies.  Hm?  Yeah, my freshman year, you two were seniors.   Right before winter break.   [Archer] Anyway, you each had  maybe twenty pounds on me, and you cornered me  in the field house, and you just laid into me,  [boys grunting] [Young Archer] No! No! No! No!  And then you got me upside down, over the toilet,  and I started screaming, because I look down  and the toilet\'s full of piss.  Whitney had pissed in it.   So I\'m screaming, and you\'re both laughing,  and it\'s all echoing off the tiles,  and then Whitney looks down at me  with these crazy eyes, and he screams at me    You think I won\'t [bleep] kill you?  And then he punches me, hard, and I\'m choking on the blood  from my nose, and then you dunk me, and hold me under for  I honestly don\'t even know.  I lost consciousness.  [toilet flushing]  [sigh] But long story short, I didn\'t make varsity that spring  because I was getting over pneumonia,  which I got because, during that swirlie,  turns out I aspirated water in my lungs.   Well, and presumably urine.   [inhales] Look    Archer, I want you to kill me.  I\'m sorry?  Well, you should be! Why the hell  would you say that to the headmaster?  I thought he was hinting at it!  Why would you think that?  When someone uses the term "exclusive"  to describe something, what are they    No blacks or Jews.   Wh   Exactly, so    Malory, he was Jewish!  That\'s why I was so confused.   I\'m not sure I\'m following you.   I\'m dying.  Liver cancer, stage four.   I\'ve got maybe three months left,  every minute of which, the doctors tell me,  I\'ll spend writhing in agony.   Jesus, Ivy.  Yeah.   Yeah, and honestly I am too scared to face that.   At first I thought    but  What about good old pills and vodka?  Life insurance won\'t pay out on a suicide,  and I\'m not going to cheat my wife out of ten million dollars.   No, I guess they   but I can\'t, um    You can, though.  Please, I\'m begging you,  don\'t make me go through that.   Can\'t you go to Switzerland, or    No, no, but you can.   You can open a Swiss account  with the $100,000 I\'m going to pay you.   I   Ivy, I\'m not a hit man, I\'m a    A father, a father who\'d like  a space at Country Day for his  I guess, what, mulatto bastard?  [clears throat] I think technically she\'s an octoroon bastard,  but our whole parenting philosophy is sort of, uh,  post label? [chuckling]  Yeah, good luck with that.  Yeah, so how do you wanna die?  [clears throat] Home invasion.  You break into my house,  I startle you, you shoot me.   I assume you have access to a firearm?  I do, yeah   But you can\'t shoot me in the face.   Or the belly.  Or in the legs.   Why would I shoot you in the legs?  Well I just don\'t want to suffer.   That\'s kind of the whole point.   We could do two in the back of the head:  That\'s painless, instantaneous.   Have you killed people before?  Uh, yeah.  Literally scores of them.   I actually used to be the world\'s greatest secret agent?  Oh, before becoming an unlicensed private investigator.   After a brief stint as a drug dealer.   [clears throat] Okay, let\'s do this.   Tonight.  Wait, when? What?  Tonight.  Why wait? I\'ll be home alone,  and it\'s the maid\'s night off.   My wife will be at a fundraiser.   Kids? I think owls?  Do you have children?  Oh, no.  Just a bedroom safe,  which I will conveniently leave open,  and in which will be $100,000.   And a letter of recommendation for Abbiejean  Archer Kane? Kane Archer? I\'ll leave the name blank.   [scoffs] Yeah, I should probably know that  [deep breath] Okay, so where and when?  Malibu, there\'s my address.   The when I don\'t want to know.   I\'m going to go home, kiss my wife goodbye,  and then start pounding Armagnac.   Alrighty then, see ya at like, 10:00?  I don\'t want to know!  Sorry, sorry.  It won\'t be 10:00.   Get out.  [spooky] Or will it?  Get out! [giggles, chuckles]   reads the card of a man   A knight who is armored with a savage tan   [door opening] Oh, hey, good, you got the ammo?  10 rounds, custom made, hand loaded.   32 caliber, hollow point, copper jacketed.   Fragmentation round.     No, Jethro Dull, it\'s for a case.   What case? What are you talking about? And why wasn\'t I informed?  Calm down, Cyril.  It\'s just a, um, corporate security evaluation.   Unless you want me to turn down ten grand.   Well no, obviously I don\'t   wait, why did you hesitate there, on "ten"?  It\'s a lotta money, Cyril, which I have to go earn for the agency now!  Wh   Hey, don\'t forget to get a    Recommendation letter.  Got it.  Shut up!  [scoffs] Ten grand my butt.   I bet Archer\'s charging them twice that.   Lana, I want you to tail him tonight, and    No, I can\'t.  Okay? Tonight I have to bake a huge batch of hamentashen  and take them over to that headmaster.   Wait, what, at his house? Yes.   That sounds like a really bad idea.   So does minding my business.  [slurping]  And apparently her business  is ambiguous, poorly worded burns.   Yeah, right? Okay, so Ray.   I want you to follow Archer tonight, and   Oooh, can\'t.   Why not? Don\'t get shitty with me!  Her excuse was hamentashen, and you didn\'t even blink!  Since when do you get a free pass around here just for having a vagina?  Yeah, Cyril!  And also, what is it good for?  What is what good for?  The free pass for havin\' a vag.  Duh.   I assume we can expect discounts  at local businesses and theme parks?  Oh for the   fine, I\'ll do it myself!  Well, good luck with no vagina! Ugh.   [gasps] Not you, Ms.  Archer!  Although Wh   She\'s obviously got a vagina.   Yeah, probably why she\'s such a bitch.   [Archer] Jesus, really?  A glass house? [sighs]  Probably so people driving by have to watch him  bang his model wife on a mattress stuffed with doubloons.   [chuckles] Not tomorrow, buddy.  Then all they\'re gonna see is,  well, I guess a bunch of cop cars,  and whatever the coroner drives, probably a van  Oh and your wife\'s car, since she\'s    she\'s the one who\'s gonna find you.   But, ya know, who\'s to say if that\'s any worse  than being forced to watch you die  a slow and agonizing death? Right?  Plus I didn\'t give you cancer.   Plus you\'re the world\'s biggest dick.   Except for maybe Whitney.  Oh, and Hitler.   Plus, I didn\'t give you cancer.   Well, I can\'t say I blame him.   I\'d be getting drunk too, in his shoes  I can\'t imagine what it would be like to know when you\'re gonna die.   Or even if.  [snoring]  [sighs] Feel like I should say a few words.   But none spring to mind.  Okay then.   Archer, you can\'t do this yet.   What if he didn\'t open the safe?  Where even is the safe? Dammit  [man yelling]  What the   [screams]  [yells] What the shit, Ivy, what are you    You think I won\'t [bleep] kill you?  What the   Whitney?  Swirling?  [pants] [clears throat]  [ gun fires ] [screams]  Oh, God! Ow!  [sobbing, whimpering] Oh, shut up.  It\'s not that bad.   I have no pinky toe! You asshole!  Hey! I\'m not the asshole here! Whitney!  I\'m the guy with the gun! Not the asshole, with eight toes!  Nine, you   Oh, yeah.  Yeah.   [groans] So, since you\'re the only person on the planet  that I\'d like to kill more than Ivy, and since I haven\'t yet,  why did he hire me to do that?  I don\'t know, he\'s crazy!  And then maybe, in his paranoid mind,  he thinks that for the past five years maybe  I\'ve been embezzling from the fund and also maybe sleeping with his wife?  For five years?  We maybe just had our anniversary.   Hey, congratulations Oh, thanks, man.   On still being a massive dickhole.   Okay, so I promised Ivy I\'d kill you.   No, no, wait, wait, wait, wait!  Look, whatever he\'s paying you,  I will double it!  Well he\'s paying me a hundred    dammit   and fifty thousand dollars, so    [Cyril] Ahaa! [both] What?  Ten thousand, my butt! I knew it!  Are you   Cyril, you followed me?  You lied to me!  Yeah, but you didn\'t know that.   On some level, I think we both did.   Hello, Cyril Figgis, owner and lead investigator of The Figgis Agency.   How\'s it going? Trent Whitney, murder victim.   Would be murder victim!  I\'m sorry, what what\'s happening?  My partner paid him to kill me.   He what? You what? Under false pretenses, Cyril!  Calm down, I thought I was killing the other guy.   Why were you killing anybody?  Because I thought he had cancer.   And also in prep school  both of them bullied the absolute shit out of me.   [laughing] What? Seriously, dude?  You were going to murder me \'cause I picked on you a little bit?  A little? You almost killed me!  I spent freshman year in the hospital!  With what, AIDS? [chuckles]  Pneumonia! From what, complications from AI   Ow!  Jesus Christ.  And if I\'m being honest, yeah,  I\'m sure the bullying had some influence on my decision,  but I was actually murdering you   well, Ivy   for money.   And that makes it better?  Money and cancer, then! Jesus!  But don\'t tell me you never fantasized about killing your bullies, Cyril.   [Archer, crying] Cyril?  Cyril!  It puts the lotion in the basket!  [Archer] What? What?  What\'re we doing? Um, I think Whitney  was about to pay me $300,000?  Not to kill him? That\'s extortion!  I know, Cyril, but think of the alternative.  His hands are tied.   And yes, yes, dude, I will pay you,  but the money\'s not in my house.  It\'s, it\'s, it\'s    [impersonating Jimmy Stewart] It\'s in Tom\'s house, and and Bill\'s house.   And and and and and and and!  Okay, okay, wait, wait! [keypad pressing]  Dude, check this out.  What if I paid you 500, and you kill Ivy?  Mmm, no, I think just the three.   Ivy\'s a cuckold, betrayed by his wife and friend.   You\'re a cuckolding thief, and between us, clearly an alcoholic.   He\'s an alcoholic.  He didn\'t know  he was gonna die tonight, Cyril.  For him it\'s just Tuesday.   Anyway, you\'re both so obviously and profoundly unhappy  with who you became, that I bet you\'re both gonna die  in some bizarre murder suicide,  and that is reward enough for me.   Yeah.  That and $300,000.   Yeah.  [sighs] Well, you may be right about that.   But I\'ll tell you this, Swirling.   I shoulda drowned you in piss when I had the chance, you little fa    [blood splatters] [yelps]  Huh.  Jeezy Petes!  Great shot, Archer.  [scoffs] Yeah, right?  But as much as I\'d like to take credit for that  Ahh! Yeah, right?  Ahh.  Oof.   Who the heck is shooting at us?  [chuckling] Cyril, c\'mon.   It\'s obviously Ivy.   C\'mon, Swirling, where are you?  I bet this was his plan all along.   He follows me, I kill Whitney, he kills me,  looks like a robbery.  But I thought he had cancer.   No, dummy, that was just a ruse.   But either way, when I had cancer,  I bet I killed, like, 20 guys,  so it\'s not a death sentence anymore, is my point.   No, but this is!  Yeah, he almost made the Olympics.   What? Biathlon, I know,  you think to yourself "Pretty gay sport," but    Holy shit! What?  You think he knows Ray?  Cyril, stop it! I mean it, hang up!  Gimme, Cyril.  Dammit! Get off.  Stop it! Archer!  [Lana] This is Lana Kane.  Leave a message.   [beep] Lana! Lana, we\'re    We\'re fine.  Everything\'s great.   Bye, hon.  Oww!  Jeezy Petes! See?  I told you not to call her.   Well, we can\'t call the police.   No, uh, this does not look good.   Wonder why she didn\'t pick up.   [Lana] I can explain.   What, why you\'re stalking this guy?  Stalking? It\'s just hamentashen!  Okay.  You wanna explain this?  [sigh] You got a license for that?  Well, I\'m a private investigator, so   [officer laughs]  Got a license for that? [laughs]  Well, not, um, you know, technically, but   No.   All you got is baby pictures, a Sub Club card and  what appears to be a very crudely drawn "vagina pass. "  [groans]  Okay, so call Ray, on your cell!  I can\'t.  Why not?  After the whole biker voicemail fiasco  Mother took it away.  What?  What are you, 9 years Ow!  Haha! Ow! Haha! Ow!  Shut up! And then you call Ray.   Cyril, why aren\'t you calling Ray?  Because I don\'t have a mobile carrier.  Why not?  I\'ve been comparison shopping for the best rate plan.   For three months? There are literally two companies!  What the hell can you possibly be comparing?  Their respective rate plans!  Wow.  Okay, so if we live through this,  which I wouldn\'t bet on, I   Wait, shut up!  [sniffs] Do you smell that?  Oh, my God, did you shit yourself?  No, that! [sniffs]  Oh that.  Yeah, that\'s gas.  What?  A round must\'ve clipped the gas line to the stove.   Oh my God.  Yeah, not great.   Even a tiny spark    And we\'re dead.   So while you\'re getting the money out of the safe   What?  No, nuh uh! There\'s nothing between  the safe and the bullets! [gun fires]  There\'s me.  I\'m gonna draw his fire.   I\'m gonna make a run for the car.  Meanwhile, you clear out the safe!  Okay, but   Wait, what\'s to keep you from just leaving me here?  Wha   The money, you idiot!  Oh right, that makes   What? One, two, three, go!  [yelling]  Ahh.  [gun firing]  Seriously.  That must be so sticky.   Son of a   Can\'t have anything nice.  [car revs]  Cyril, let\'s go!  Hang on! There\'s    Cyril! I swear to God I will leave you!  [car revs] Ah.  Ooh.   [yelps] Archer, wait!  [groans]  Oh, good.  You made it.   [tires screeching] In the   In the safe he had  all this stuff from   from    [frustrated groan]  Holy shit! Jeezy Petes!  Dammit! Should\'ve gone to the owl thing.   [Archer] What?  [tires screeching]  Longwater! Just like the    The Veronica Deane case, I know.   What the hell was in the safe?  Files, disks, all kinds of stuff!  And you just left it? You left me!  No, I merely tried to!  Hey, Swirling!  Wow, think of how good you\'d have to be  to make the Olympic   What the?  Cyril, what\'re you    Suppressing fire!  [firing blanks]  [chuckles]  So, do you have more bullets, or [gun fires]  No.  Oof!  Cyril, I am so mad at you right now, my mouth tastes like copper.   Well, but are you actually mad at me,  Yes! or    the bullies who tormented a scrawny teenage boy with no friends?   You!  Because I find it interesting that you were bullied in school,  and now as an adult you\'re a bully.   Do you want to talk about how you bully me?  I do, Cyril.  I really do,  but I\'m afraid I\'ll tear up,  and then not be able to see the road  and then plunge us off the cliff, and then if you\'re still alive,  strangle you to death with my bloody and broken hands!  I also find it interesting that you,  Sterling Archer, man without fear, are running away from your bully.   Because Cyril Figgis, man without sense,  wasted all the ammunition!  [tires screeching] Well, but I  think in a much larger sense  you\'ve been running from those two your entire life.   And whether it\'s your personal relationships, or   [yelps] Archer?  Take the wheel, dummy! And you!  Me what?  [roars]  How you like that, Ivy? [groaning]  Fighting somebody bigger and stronger than you? Crazy, right?  Imagine what it was like for a lonely, skinny 13 year old kid  who\'d been to six different boarding schools since he was five!  Hint! It wasn\'t great! [groaning]  [yelps] Yeah, just gonna give them some space,  do the good old "three Mississippi. "  [both groan] But I hope it was great for you, Ivy,  because your bullying days are over!  Go ahead, Swirling! Shoot me!  Oh, huh uh, you don\'t get to take the easy way out, Ivy.   You\'re going to jail! Well, you say that.   Whoa!  Archer!  [tires screeching]  [tumbling]  Oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, Archer!  Yes, what? Shut up.   Oh, my God, how are you still alive?  Jumped out at the last second, Cyril.   The same kind of split second decision making  that caused you to leave a bunch of clues in the safe!  Idiot! Ow!  Did you learn nothing from this?  [chuckles] No.   So listen, I know you\'ve had your heart set on AJ going to Country Day,  but I\'ve really given it some serious thought,  and I\'m not sure it\'s the best thing for her.   I know all kids can be bullies, but at private school  it seems like there\'s even more, I dunno, elitism or snobbery or whatever.   So I really want us to think about A. J.  going to public school.   Because studies have shown that if a child\'s intelligent,  and I think A. J.  really is, then it doesn\'t matter where they go to school.   It\'s much more important that learning is fostered in the home  by loving and supportive parents.   [horn blasting]  Plus with the restraining order,  you can\'t go within 500 feet of the school,  which means I\'d be stuck doing drop offs and pick ups every day.   Which, ya know, not doing that.   Anyway, so keep your chin up, or down I guess.   Shapiro\'s at your bail hearing right now,  so you\'ll be out of here before  Um, dammit.  Um  You trying to think of a lesbian joke?  No, hair joke.  Something about braids?  Ah, no, it\'s gone.  Okay stay hard! What?  Archer! Can you at least put some money on my canteen account?  No!1 I can\'t, I gotta go drive my car now,  I got   Huh? I dunno, ask her.   I gotta drive my automobile, on road!  [laughs] [slurping]  What? Are you shitting me?  Pfff, see about this bullshit.   [groans] [car horn honking]  Hey! Yeah, that\'s the ol\' pepper!  [chuckling] Take me to my house that I live in!  [giggles]  [slurping]  [belches]  Oh, oh my God, rumaki.   Do you smell that?  Uh, I did not, actually.  [scoffs]  Matter of fact, I can\'t smell anything.   Archer.  Wha  ?  Barry? [laughs] Hey, dummy.   No, no, no.  Wa wa wa wa wait.   Bulletproof.   [high pitched whining]  [voice muffled] You say "bulletproof?"  [Barry, muffled] You can\'t tell, can you?  You think I\'m gonna be that dumb? Oh, my God.   Mawp.  not really surprising.   Bet you\'re surprised to see me though, huh?  Yes, I am, Barry, because I blew your ass up  in a grain elevator! Oww! [brakes screeching]  Yeah, Archer, I remember.   Every time I look in the goddamn mirror!  The   Wait, are you invisible now?  No, you idiot!  I\'m just a walking titanium endoskeleton.   Oh.  So, do you clank, or   Oww! [brakes screeching]  Yes, dickhole, I clank! Happy?  I mean   Well, I\'m not! And ya wanna know why?  Because, not even in this order,  you shot me, shattered both my femurs,  cornholed both my fiances, got me turned into a robot,  left me to die in outer frickin\' space!  And also blew me up in a grain elevator! [slurping]  [coughing] Oh my God, Framboise! Remember her?  Yes, Archer, I do.  And that alone  would be reason enough to kill you!  But that is not why I came to L. A.   Well, if it was to see the Aztecs play, I got some bad news.   Will you shut up? I came out here to find someone.   [chuckles] And then I saw this little guy.   [Barry laughing] Oh, for   Goddamn it, Pam!  I can\'t believe you\'re a private eye.   Well, it\'s better than driving a cab!  I don\'t drive a cab, super sleuth!  This is just a ruse.  I clamped your car.   Why? Because, you giant flapping anus,  I wanna hire you! I    Look, not many people know this, all right,  but I grew up in an orphanage.  I never met my mother,  and I always felt like I was missing a big piece of,  not me, necessarily, but the me I could\'ve been, ya know?  And maybe I brought some of this on myself,  but I feel that there\'s a better other Barry in here.   If I could just reconnect with my birth mother, maybe,  just maybe, we could find him.   [laughing]  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay!  Barry, oh man, I mean how could it occur to you  for a nanosecond that I would help you?  Hey, I\'m coming to you as a man here.   No, you\'re not.  You\'re coming to me as a robot mummy!  Oh my God, who\'s   Archer, no!  Who\'s got    Don\'t you say it! No mummy!  [laughing] Okay, so now we\'re doing this.   [laughter continues] [brakes screech]  [groaning]  [groaning continues]  [chuckles]  Bawk, bawk.      [Archer] Ugh, what is this, a stairs factory?  Ugh! Oh.  Oh, hey.   So, this is Crab Rangoon, it is going in the refrigerator,  and it is very much mine.  Any questions?  Krieger, looking at you.  Okay, then.   Oh, and so guess who I saw last night?  Uh, Barry? Yeah, wait, how\'d you    [Barry] Ahem.  Wha  ?  [chuckling] Hey, dummy.   You cyborg son of a bitch!  [All] No, no, no! Don\'t!  We already tried that!  Yeah, so, uh, you wanna throw it at me now?  You know, like the old timey Superman mov    That was obviously sarcasm.   And yet almost as satisfying as not helping you  find your stupid mother, which there\'s no way I\'m gonna do!  Well, you say that Archer.   Carol? Her name\'s Cher    Pam, shut up!  [Malory] Help!  Mother? She can\'t hear you.   Help!  Mother! Still can\'t hear you.   Where is that? Where is she?  Carol? She\'s about ten feet below that.   What? What is that?  It\'s a generator running an air pump!  Which is pumping air to Carol?  [Archer] You son of a    Wait, how did you do all this since just last night?  Huh? Oh no, no, no.  I\'ve been planning this for weeks.   I knew when I asked you for help  you\'d be a big, weeping dick.   Barry, listen to me.  Okay, but remember,  we don\'t have a lot of time here.   That generator\'s only got about 12 more hours\'  worth of fuel, and once it runs out  [chuckles] Whoops.   No! Yeah.   You animal!  Pfff, a robot\'s like  the furthest thing you can be from an anim    Oww! Seriously.   So if you wanna find your mother   [roars]  [group gasps] Archer.   So, if we\'re done with the heroics  For now at least, yeah, I think so.   Good, because just to reiterate  Time\'s a bit of a factor here.   [chuckling]  Hello? Who are you?  Why won\'t you answer me? What do you want?  [sobs]  Ow! Quit squeezing the puppy, Lennie!  Oh hush, you big baby.  It\'s just a through and through.   Yes, which means both holes hurt!  Hey, I know you\'re upset, but we are gonna find Barry\'s mother,  and Malory is gonna be okay.   Now, I believe there was some mention of holes?  [sighs] Phrasing, boom.   That\'s the spirit.  Shut up.   And then talk again, but only to help me think of a way to kill Barry.   Why don\'t we just find his mother?  Why, just so she can bury him?  Yeah, because trying to kill Barry  has gone so well for you in the past.   Yeah, Lana, but this time it\'s, um  [chuckles] Were you gonna say, "This time it\'s personal"?  [chuckling] Yeah, but I didn\'t.   [clears throat] But also it is.   [Cyril] Because here\'s my concern  The orphanage where you grew up burned down.   [giggles] Shut up, and all the records were lost in the fire,  so not only do you not know  your birth mother\'s name No.   You don\'t know the hospital where you were born.   Uh uh.  Or the town, or even the county.   Nope.  Or even your actual date of birth!  I   Look, if this was easy  I wouldn\'t have to bury ladies out in the desert!  Yeah, so did she struggle?  Did you have to punch her in her bony face?  No, Creepy Spice, I used chloroform.   Aw.  Yeah, her husband didn\'t even wake up.   Damn machine.  You need a Ph. D.   for this thing.  It\'s like the Univac.   It says here "grind. " It\'s already ground from the store!  I just want it to drip, but there\'s no button for drip!  What are you, in the shower? Hello?  Do I need to mess with "program"?  And because it was a closed adoption with any record of it sealed,  we need to basically hack into the state\'s vital records database,  and comb through millions of records!  Yeah, so then do that.   I   [sighs] But even if we could hack in    Their password security\'s probably just eight bit,  so I\'d suggest a combination of dictionary attack,  reverse cryptographic hash function,  and good old fashioned brute force.   Oh, we can do that? Lemon squeezy.   Oh, okay, but my larger, sort of overall concern  is that it\'s a felony.   Well, but so is painting the walls in here  with you people\'s tiny brains.   [all gasp] Yeah, so whaddya say we "get crackin\'"?  [chuckles]  See what I did there? Pun wise?  Samuel Johnson tells us that puns are the lowest form of comedy,  but for me it\'s murder.   [Archer] Damn it, people, my mother is buried alive!  What is taking so long?  We\'re going as fast as we can!  And why is it so frickin\' hot?  What? Why do you think?  To crack the password we need  every last bit of this computing power!  Still though It is pretty hot.   Sweet Jesus Metal Christ! Whoa, my God!  What\'s the matter? C\'mon, Lana.   It\'s nothing you haven\'t seen before.   Wait, what? Yeah, dude,  me and her b b b boned.  What?  Did I know this? When was this?  Way back! When he was, ya know  What, back when I was what, Lana? Human?  I mean   I still have feelings!  Well, then put some damn clothes on!  No, no! You can just feast  your beady little eyes on my endoskeleton!  [excitedly gasps] Here\'s an idea! Turn on the A/C!  [Pam] Yeah, right!  We\'re way over maximum voltage.   I got about a buck fifty in pennies  crammed in the fusebox as it is.   [all groaning] Oh, relax.   Worst case, an innocent migrant farmhand  goes to turn on the milking machine and gets electrocuted.   What? I mean, worst case we fry some circuits.   Hmm What?  I mean, how\'s Mother?  I wanna see her, put her up on the monitor.   Okay! But just for a second.   Oh and keep it on "mute. " Carol.   [all groaning] [Barry chuckles]  Yeah, she\'s really losing her shit.   hunt you bastards down  and have your guts for garters, you hear me?  My God, get it together.   You\'ve been in tighter spots than this.   East Berlin, Warsaw.  Ugh, Khartoum?  At least this time you\'re not hooked up to a car battery.   Or up to your ankles in camel blood.   And whoever these bastards are,  they must not want you dead just yet.   But what do they want? And where is this?  [sighs] Well, it\'s hard to say, really.   I mean, we\'re computating as fast as we can,  but every possible permutation of this password  is something on the order of ten to the ninth power, so    Got it! Wait, what? Wait, what?  [muttering] Whoo!  Can\'t hear anything.   Although I can feel just the slightest draft, but  [deep sniff] Hm.  Maybe a hint of diesel?  Doesn\'t help much, that could be anywhere.   Although "anywhere" usually has some kind of sounds.   Traffic, birds, a train.  Here there\'s just nothing.   Could   Damn it, I\'m underground!  But what kind of sick, twisted, bastard  Whoo! Barry\'s baggin\' some tea!  [thrusting sounds]  I suppose there\'s really no telling.   You spend your whole life in espionage,  you\'re going to make a few enemies.   But kiddo, you\'re not gonna sit here on your keister  waiting to find out who\'s behind this.  So.  Step one.   And now for step two.   [inhales, grunts]  [exhales] Step two\'s always a bitch.   All right, now step three.   [grunting]  [Barry] Okay, so now what, now what?  Well, I think the first thing we should do  is make Pam put on some clothes.   Don\'t try to body shame me!  Dog Tits! Yeah, shut up.   [sighs] So now, we have to go through  all these millions of records line by line,  looking for any records with your given name,  and hope we can cross reference that  to find some record of your birth mother\'s name.   What? How long is that gonna take?  I   Awhile, Archer.   Oh, well then, can I borrow Krieger?  No.  How does that help the situation?  It helps my leg, Cyril,  which I think might be turning septic,  thanks to your new best friend, Darth Barry!  You do realize I\'m not that kind of a doc    Krieger, break room now, goddamn it! So, is it cool if I    Yeah, but give him some morphine or something to shut him up,  \'cause I\'ve really got this warm, hopeful feeling right now,  and I kinda feel like it\'s gonna be ruined  if I have to pull his spine out through his face.   Um, and also can I go to the bathroom? No.   Then why does Archer get to do whatever he wants  plus morphine when you\'re not even my robot supervisor!  Okay, Jesus, go to the bathroom.   Well, if she\'s going   Everybody go to the damn bathroom!  Go crazy, use the frickin\' bidet!  I\'m not the one running out of oxygen here.   Oh right, I forgot about Miss Archer.   Although [grunts]  step three\'s no prize.  [groans]  Aha!  And now, for these damn cuffs!  [Krieger] You lost me.   I want you to Edison this elephant.   Ooo kay.  Nope, still lost.   Thomas Edison! Remember? When he killed that elephant  by jamming a big, fat electric cable up its asshole?  What? Yeah.   The kindly Wizard of Menlo Park,  bought a sweet old circus elephant just to murder it.   Now I want you to figure out a way to zap Barry  with enough juice to shut down his CPU.   Uh, okay, like   Like, just brick him.  [zapping sound]  But the KGB built him.  I\'m sure all his circuits are shielded.   It would take like, gigawatts worth of volts.   Okay, that doesn\'t sound right.  It\'s not.   But how many volts do you think we have with  two pounds of pennies jammed in the fusebox?  Hmm, and if I routed it all to a single circuit,  like the dimmer switch in the bullpen,  maybe spilled an electrolytic solution on the floor  for good measure, and get Barry to touch said dimmer switch  Wait, what happened to jamming  a big, fat electric cable up his asshole?  Well, A, I don\'t think he even has an asshole, not that I was looking,  and B, a dimmer switch is way easier.   Okay, but   But wait, if you fry Barry\'s CPU,  he can\'t tell you where Miss Archer is!  Well, I\'ll worry about that bridge when I come to it!  I kinda think you should worry about it before then.   Krieger, if I worried about a fraction of the stuff  I should be worried about, I\'d never get anything done!  I know, but   Oh my God, BPA!  I   Transgendered frogs!  [frog bribbit] Shh, shh, shh.   [Gillette] What? I said I\'m in love with Barry.   [toilet flushes] [laughs] I knew that was coming.   Oh, my tits, what? How could   He\'s a frickin machine!  Well, Ray, a machine is like a desert.   Either it fascinates or appalls you.   What? It\'s not "noice!" Noyce.   How could you be attracted to a homicidal maniac?  No, that\'s a quote by Wilfrid Noyce.   Really? What? Yes!  The mountaineer? Yes!  Well, here\'s a quote by me:  Barry\'s about to violate the First Law of Robotics  [whispers] on my vagina.   [chuckling] Noice.   Ha! Now just to see where the hell I am  What? Oh, for the love!  Although, no matter who or what ends up killing me,  you could probably paint that on the wall.   The idiot.   Let\'s go, people.  The clock is ticking.   Tick tock, tick tock.   Name something a clock would say.   Barry, you could, ya know, help!  [chuckles] I\'m too wound up!  Name something a clock would   Ray.   Seriously.  I could maybe help you unwind.   [Lana] Ugh.  Didn\'t I murder you one time?  Maybe [Archer] Carol!  Get back to work, what are you doing? What are you doing?  Well, you guys were all pretty sweaty,  so I brought you some Sports Drank to    Oh, damn it! Damn.  Damn.  Damn.  Damn it!  Probably because it\'s so dark in here.   Yeah, Archer, it is getting dark,  which means your mommy is running out  of both time and oxygen!  It also means potentially dangerous eye strain  for these hardworking folks, Barry.   So why don\'t you go over there and turn up that dimmer?  You turn up the damn dimmer! No, Barry, you do it!  Ugh, Jesus, I\'ll turn up the stupid dimmer.   Carol, no! Don\'t touch that dimmer! Wait a minute  Why do you want me to touch the light switch?  Hm? And all the sports drank conveniently spilled  on the floor, full of electrolytes?  Is it? Are you trying to electrocute me?  [gasps] What, no!  [Krieger screams] [sighs] Apparently not.   If I was electrocuted, how the hell were you gonna find your mother?  So there were a couple of holes!  [Pam] Wait, are we doing   Jesus!  You were willing to risk that? Oh, that is classic you!  A mother! The one thing  I\'ve been searching for my entire goddamn life,  and you take it for granted!  Just like you do with everything else!  Shut up! Well, guess what!  You take your mother for granted? Fine!  Good luck finding her without the coordinates!  [all gasping] What the shit?  I don\'t think that\'s gonna be a problem.   [exhales] First thing, I\'m taking a long hot bath  with a nice stiff drink.   [grunts]  And then I\'m going to kill everybody!  Yeah? Well, get in line, lady!  [all] Hey, whoa! Calm down!  After I kill all you idiots, I\'m    [Pam] I found her! [all muttering]  Found who? Your mom! At least I think I did.   [all chattering] Let me see.   So, the Hide A Wee Home For Children  That\'s where I grew up! Took in a newborn baby,  born at County Hospital close to your dates,  who was christened Bartholomew Aloysius Dylan.   That\'s me! Little baby Barty D. !  And, according to County Hospital\'s records,  the baby was put up for adoption by a young woman named  You sure you wanna know this?  [gunfire] [all clamoring]  Yeah.  [sighs]  Tammy Jo Stamps, age 16.   Holy shitsnacks!  And she\'s still alive, you guys!  She lives in L. A. !  [all muttering]  [bawling] Well? What are you waiting for?  You got what you wanted!  Go to her!  Just go!  I mean, yeah, right? I mean, right?  Well, I mean, yeah, but  But what? I mean, you can\'t go like that.   Why, what are you  Oh my God, I look like the Terminator!  Well, a Terminator.   I think I may have just the thing.   Okay, I was kinda saving this for  this other thing, but anyhoo.   [all gasping]  What the shit, Krieger?  What?  Why do you have our heads?  And hands.  What, it\'s for this other nothing.   So! Who\'s it gonna be, big guy?  [chuckling]  Holy shit, now I know you\'re crazy.   What, you thought I\'d pick you?  I mean Or Gillette?  [chuckles] The poor man\'s Frank Langella?  Oh my God, I am.   No, this is the face.  How do I look?  [all muttering]  Yeah, right? Okay, so  Wow! Off to meet my birth mother.   Wish me luck, friends! [all] Good luck.   [chuckles] Thanks, guys!  [brakes screeching] [all] Oh!  [Barry] I\'m okay!  [sarcastic muttering]  [sighs] Like a bad penny.   Oh, shit! The pennies!  [Lana] So, what did we learn?  [muttering]  I learned Wow.   Nothing? Nope.   I learned that the cabinet  of Dr.  Krieger is full of our faces.   And hands.  I   Look,  don\'t worry about it.  I really feel like we should.   Oh, you worry about everything.   Oh, shit! I hope Mother\'s okay.   [dopey laugh]  [trucker] Evenin\'.   I\'ll give you $1,000 for a ride to the nearest bar.   [trucker laughs] What?  Oh, shit yeah, lady, climb on up!  [groans] Yeah, there ya go, get on up in here.   [Malory groans] Whew.  Thank you.   [trucker chuckles] Thank you.  A thousand bucks?  You\'re either crazy or rich or both.   [Malory] Well, I don\'t have it on me obviously, but  [trucker] Oh, I betcha we can work something out.   [Malory] Ahem, your hand seems to be on my thigh.   [trucker] Yeah, you\'re like a silver fox.   [Malory] I beg your pardon?  [trucker] And I\'m just hopin\'  them curtains match the rug, \'cause I like that.   [Malory sighs]  [punching]  [groans, chokes]  [coughing]  [Malory] Ya like an elbow to the throat?  Shitheel.   Although, if you had worded that a bit more delicately  it could\'ve been quite flattering, so  well, not thank you, necessarily, but  [choking]  [Malory] Je ne sais quoi.  Exactement.  Ciao!  [continues choking]1 Which brings us to our penultimate item,  which concerns yet again, and to no great surprise  the restrooms.   Specifically, the towel dispensers.   Why\'d you get the loopy, old timey  cloth kind in the first place?  Because Shut up.   And I don\'t know who\'s doing it,  and I doubt even God knows why,  but my next step is to have  the damn things swabbed for DNA!  Seems like it\'d be easier just to take out the trash cans.   Whoever\'s doing it, they obviously  have to climb up on a trash can.   \'Cause it\'s like, up here, so  Wow.  Name a handsome Hollywood power lawyer  who is having major second  thoughts about hiring you people.     Mr.  Shapiro!   Boom! Square gets the square!  And I get going.  You guys validate?  Mr.  Shapiro, please, as I said on the phone,  the Figgis Agency values your business,  and I can assure you this internal affair  doesn\'t reflect our ability as investigators, so    Yes, it does.    Archer?  What? Shut up.  If anything,  it proves I\'m a great investigator.   I totally just Encyclopedia Browned that thing.   Bugs Meany is wiping his ass on our towels?    No, dummy!   Yes! It\'s the only explanation!  Well, or any of the Tigers.   So, is it like a stamp, or stickers  Please, you\'ve come all this way.   And obviously you thought we were  the right agency for the job.   And besides, we\'re only 25 cents a day, plus expenses.   For the love of Christ, woman!  Seriously, you gotta shut up.   You shut up! Because I\'m catching  the first bus outta this hick town!  Ha! So long, Idaville!  As I was saying  Okay.     Hmm?   Okay!  I can\'t get anyone else on such late notice, and  I dunno.  Maybe you people can handle this job, so  Mind if I, uh, beep boop?  Oh, preesh.  Okay, so  I\'m sure you all remember my client,  Hollywood legend Veronica Deane.     Remember?   Ugh.     Who could forget?   Right?  She almost makes me Q my G.   What, did she die of old age?  Oh, for the She\'s 50!  And, if anything, more beautiful than ever.   Especially when she\'s wearing  the Tsarina, an emerald and diamond necklace  crafted for Empress Maria Alexandrovna in 1855,  and now the, uh, centerpiece of Ms.  Deane\'s collection.   My God, it must be worth millions!  And you want us to steal it!  I No! No, that\'s the exact opposite of what I want.   She wants to wear the Tsarina to a fund raiser  hosted by her ex husband, Ellis Crane,  Oscar winning director and also total jit rag.     Ooh!   He\'s handsome!  Ugh! Total jit rag.   Wearing that necklace to a crowded event  seems like a pretty big risk.   I know.  Believe me,  I tried to talk Ms.  Deane out of wearing it, but  Is it just to rub it in his face?  Man, I\'d rub it in his face!    Pam!   I will stop, but I will not apologize.   So, you want us to guard the necklace.   Yes.  Undercover, at the fund raiser.   For which, I am prepared to pay your agency s $50,000.     Oh, nice!   Pretty good.   But surely the necklace is insured.   And even if the deductible was, like  Obviously more than that, Lana.     Yeah, Lana.    Holy shit snacks!  So we\'re going to a no shit black tie Hollywood gala?  Well, yes, but  But what do we wear? Is it, like, gowns and gloves?  And do I rent a girdle? Are there gonna be dress fittings?  Do I get a bikini wax? And I don\'t know my tiara size!  And, oh, my God, what of shoes?  Uh, your attire will be provided.   This is gonna be suckin\' amazing!  Yeah.  For five eighths of you.    And so, when I said "suckin\' amazing"  obviously I meant "suckin\' bullshit. "  I mean  Seriously?  Oh, quit your griping, you three.   The whole idea is to blend in, so  Meaning?  No.  Meaning just you know  You can\'t put lipstick on a pig.     Really?   Excuse you?  What\'s that supposed to mean?    Well, that\'s a little harsh.    And also inaccurate.   Lipstick, they don\'t really mind,  but mascara? Huh, whole big thing.   And I suppose he\'s blending?    Who?   You, Otto Von Jizmarck.   I was gonna say Franz Turdinand.     Eh   Guys, come on.   What\'s going on here?  I was just explaining some basic tenets  of fieldcraft to these three.   Yeah, you gotta blend,  but I meant what\'s going on hors d\'oeuvre wise.   Wouldn\'t you like to  Blend.   This is a deconstructed slider  made from certified Kobe beef  from Hyogo prefecture,  with a tarragon aioli.   Tapas of pata negra jamn iberico,  topped with queso Torta del Casar.   And these are tiny quiches,  probably made from endangered quail eggs, or  No, none of this is that.   This is the world\'s most expensive Mc10:35.   Oh, for the Sterling!  Is that really necessary?  Mm.  Mm hm.   Mm.  Ah.   Lana, this is Hollywood.   None of this is even remotely necessary.   So if you\'ll excuse me,  I\'m gonna go guard some priceless emeralds.   Oh, really?  You\'re gonna go do the job  I\'m paying you a fortune to do?  Might as well.   I\'m already here.   And speaking of guarding the Tsarina,  do you think the optimal  formation for that is a clump?  Really?  Some bullshit job.   Oh, my God, even for Idaville,  this stupid party is so boring!  Like, hire a clown, tinnitus people.   Whatever, Pocket Tony Montana.   Wait! Tiny Montana.   Either one,  oughta be quarantined in the sick burn unit.   Excuse me.  Hi.  Pardon me.   Sterling Archer.   Hello.  Pardon me.   Or move, basically.   Good evening, Archbishop.   Could you hold this for me?  Pardon me.  Yep.  S Sorry.   That was my hand.   Jesus, glad I\'m not allergic to mink.     Right?   Hm?  Oh, hi.  Uh, so sorry.  I thought  you were Commodore Perry.   Oh, how dare you!  Remember the Maine!  Couple things.   A, Perry opened Japan to the West.   He died 40 years before the sinking of the Maine,  the cause of which spoiler alert  has since been proven to be improper coal storage,  not a Spanish harbor mine.   And two  he didn\'t have sideburns.   Did he not?  No.   He was totally  completely  clean  shaven.   Wow.  Talk about smooth sailing.   It was clearly the Age of Steam.   Hi.  Sterling Archer.   What the That little bitch!  Oh, you\'re way prettier than her.   I meant Archer.   And also, dahoy.     Oh!   Shut up!  Excuse me.  Pardon me.  Think you\'re gonna flirt  Hello.  Right in front of me  Hi.  With some C list C word!  Impossible.   Huh?  My dear, how can this be?  How have you never been in one of my pictures?  Hm.  Because I\'m not an actress?  Huh.  In what sense?  Every.   Perhaps we should begin anew.   Ellis Crane, Academy Award winner.   Lana Kane, private investigator.   You\'re kidding.   No, so if you ever have  anything that needs private investigating  I thought you were a producer.   Uh, I produce results.   Idiot!  How was that my fault?  How is everything your fault?  Aw, leave him alone.   He\'s not the one trying to shuck your lady corn.   My what?  Oh, so that\'s how it is now, huh?  Well, then you can tell Lana that two can play at that game.   Where\'s Veronica Deane?  How should I know?  Y Because you\'re supposed to be guarding her.   I\'m also supposed to be pooling tips.   Which I haven\'t gotten any yet, so  Hey, Ray! You getting any tips?    Hang on!   Excuse me.  Pardon me.   Idiot!  What\'s up her bleached asshole?  Okay, so, I\'ve been watching like a hawk,  and here\'s the whats Lana\'s pissed at Archer  \'cause she thought he was macking on  Bleached Asshole, and she\'s pissed at Archer  \'cause she thought he was a Hollywood honcho  like ol\' Whitey Crane over there,  who is macking on Lana, who\'s totally full of crap  \'cause deep down, she\'s totally  buyin\' into Whitey\'s bullshit.   So to get back at her, Archer\'s gonna  pretend to mack on, but not really,  \'cause deep down, he\'s got a  real life crush boner for her,  Veronica Deane!  Who we\'re supposed to be guarding.   Well, "whom," but yeah.   And she is  I don\'t know who she\'s into.   I meant, where is she?  How should I know?  Yeah, who is she, Kate Warne?    What?   Anyway,  I don\'t want to jinx it,  but this might end up  a murder mystery.   Well, fingers crossed.   Clump!  Aah  Okay.  Okay, here we go.   Hello?  Excuse me, Miss Deane?  Yes?  I have tinnitus.   Why do we have to clean it up?  Her dumb ass broke the damn thing.   Well, he\'s the one sneaking around, scaring people  like Casper the Ghost.   A Casper was the Friendly Ghost.   Well, take a page from his book.   You ever wonder how Casper died?  When you\'re finished here, un clump!  \'Cause my theory is Casper and Spooky  were kidnapped, raped, and murdered  by Stevie.   Wow, that sounds pretty dark.   No, Miss Kane, not dark.   Noir.     I   Or nouveau noir, if you must,  but rest assured, my dear,  Deadly Velvet will redefine the genre.   Of the private eye movie?  Um, are you  Madam, you wound me.   Deadly Velvet is going to be a cinematic tour de force,  and I want you deeply involved.   Well, but I haven\'t been a private investigator  for very long.   Had Shocking Blue been a band  very long before they recorded "Venus"?    I   No.   I don\'t know.   We can\'t know.   And speaking of not knowing  what does a technical advisor even do?  Well, advise on technical matters, of course,  but I think you could also help me  really get inside the mind of the private detective.   What makes her tick.   Oh, wow, it\'s a female lead?  What?  Oh, God, no.   What does Lana think she\'s doing?  Well, I think she\'s  She\'s embarrassing herself.  That\'s what.   Fawning all over Ellis Crane.   Trying to make Archer  When he\'s clearly much better suited  for a woman like, well,  me.   Jealous.  Hey, how\'s Ron?  He\'s great.   How\'s nobody?  You\'re gon  I [bleep] you on a blimp.   Oh, my God!  That\'s right.   Man, what ever happened to blimps?  I\'m sorry.  I don\'t know why I said that.   I mean, I do have tinnitus,  but that\'s not the main thing.   I\'m sorry.  I\'m babbling.   Hello.  Uh, Sterling Archer.   And we have actually met.   You hired me to meet some blackmailers  and exchange  I know exactly who you are.   Hm?  What I don\'t know, Mr.  Archer,  is why you would think it even remotely acceptable  to discuss such private matters  in such a public setting.   I\'m sorry.   It\'s all just so very sensitive.   Now, why are you here?  Well, for one thing, it\'s a great cause.   But for another, more accurate thing,  we\'re here because Shapiro hired us.   What? Why?  To guard the the Tsarina.   I knew I shouldn\'t have worn it.   No Yes, you totally should have.   And I get it.  I get why you did.     I wore it bec   Because, come to find out,  you and I find ourselves    in the same boat.    What?  And it\'s a totally shit boat,  and the cargo is pathetic petty jealousy.     What?   And so I apologize  for being so forward,  but I think this needs to happen,  and I think it\'s a win win.   What  Mother  What the  Get on the ground!  Get down! Move!  Archer!  Lana!  Come on.   Ladies and gentlemen  Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on.     What are you doing?   Shut up.   That is so baller.   But, like, old school baller.     Like medicine baller.    Shh.   Children of all ages,  welcome to this robbery.   I am your host,  Mr.  Rompers.   And I did not tell you to stop.   Okay, I think that red one\'s the leader,  so you\'re gonna want to take him out first.   Now, we do not wish to harm you.   Take him out? With what?  But if you try anything foolish  How do you not have a gun?  Uh, dahoy.   You will die here tonight.   Oh, right.  Yeah, that thing\'s  about three sizes too small as it is.   And how do you not have a gun?  Well, I would have if I had a jacket,  but since I\'m just a lowly waiter  Well, maybe you can pout your way out.   Shh  That was her,  running her fat mouth.   Ladies and gentlemen,  please, this is all very simple.   Every phone line has been cut.   Every exit has been booby trapped.   Now, please, give your  cell phones to Mr.  Oingo.   He\'s the handsome gentleman in orange.   And give your valuables to Mr.  Boingo.   He\'s the handsome gentleman in blue!  Please, we do not wish to harm you!  Please, just do as they say!  Thank you, my good sir.  Finished?  Hm? Uh, hm.  Uh, yes  Are you insane?  I don\'t know.  Maybe.   But check this out.   And that, ladies and germs,  is the very best you can expect.   And if Veronica Deane  doesn\'t get her wrinkly old ass out here with the Tsarina,  I guess we\'ll have to go find it!  Shh.   First of all  Giggles! Yum Yum! Pinky Brewster!  Tear this place apart, room by room!  And please don\'t take this the wrong way,  but your butt is like ka kow.   They\'re going to kill me.   No, no, they\'re not.   I have a plan, but I\'m going to need you to trust me.   Why?  Because this.   What are you doing?  They\'ll see it.   Shh.  I know.  I want them to.   What? Why?  Because I\'m gonna um,  incapacitate one of them  and then take his place.   Are you insane?  What? It\'s a proven concept.   Luke Skywalker and Han Solo.   Um, probably a ton of other examples.   Oh, God.  I\'m gonna die.     I\'m gonna die.    Shh, hush, no you\'re not,  I\'m gonna get you out of here.   But to do that,  I\'m gonna have to do a very bad thing.   W What? What do you mean?  Great.   Had to be the goofy pink one.   Just promise me you won\'t scream.   I What?  I can\'t promise that.   Okay, so if you feel it coming,  maybe just do it into your hand, phrasing.   Can you do that for me?  I I don\'t know.   I\'ll try.   Good, you\'re doing great.   Just remember to breathe  in and out.   In  and out.   In  and out.   Phrasing, doing great,  and sorry in advance for what\'s about to happen.   Oh, baby,  don\'t you worry.   I\'m gonna give you something to scream about.   Hey, Rompers, guess  So hey, again, I\'m sorry.   Why, that wasn\'t so bad.   I mean, you made it sound like you were going to  No, sorry for that.   Why did you do that?  What? That That\'s how you do it.   You could have just tied him up.   With what? And also, no, I couldn\'t.   That only works in the movies.   He would\'ve gotten loose or yelled or  Well, shooting him would\'ve been better than that.   Not for him.  Plus it\'s really loud,  and I actually do have tinnitus, so  Where did you learn that, the army?  What? No, no, God, no.   But, I mean, don\'t get me wrong.   I truly appreciate the sacrifices  of the men and women who serve in our armed forces,  but there\'s easier ways to almost  be eligible for food stamps.   It is just criminal what they get paid.   Although, I\'d probably be an officer.   Still, though  seems like a lot of running.   And now if you\'ll excuse me,  I\'m going to go kill some evil clowns.   Do you  have an erection?  No.   No.   There he is.   How you doing, bub?  Uh, who  Whuzza  Where What happened?  Oh, my God, what didn\'t happen?  Well, for starters,  you\'re a one hitter quitter.   Wait.  How long was I out?  Hm, like five hours?  Oh, that is not good.   Uh, no.   You\'re gonna want a brain scan,  you know, if we don\'t get murdered.   Which  Veronica!  Where\'s Veronica?  That\'s the thing.   Nobody knows.   And these guys are losing their shit.   Well, they\'re under a lot of stress.   Don\'t start.   Because somehow, some stupid idiot  must\'ve called 911.   And so about a jillion cops showed up,  so then it was a full on siege.   And then after that, the head clown  Mr.  Rompers.   He\'s awesome.   And he was like, "This blows dicks.   The bathroom situation\'s a nightmare.   I\'m making an executive decision.   This is too many hostages. "  And so then they let everyone go.   Wait, what? Everybody?  Well, except for kinda  the core group.   Oh, and the band, which  Good job, guys! Doing great!  Goddamn it!  What did I say about running your mouth?  Sorry, that was my jam.   Hey, Mr.  Rompers.   Shut up!  Everybody!  Wait, so did  Shut up.   Pam, tell him the best part.   Wh That is the least best part.   Tell him!  So Cheryl here  I\'m sorry.   Tania here has decided she\'s got Stockholm Syndrome.   And soon I will be Mrs.  Rompers.   Again, that\'s if we don\'t get murdered.   Shh.   WhichSo you want me to answer that or?  No, I\'ll get it.   It was probably the cops again.   Really? You think so?  I do.   My plan is in shambles!  So, hey, listen  I know, right?  He just soaks me.   Maybe we should Y You know,  you should cut your losses and surrender.   I mean, you haven\'t really hurt anybody.   No, not yet, Mr.  Shapiro, was it?  So glad you could rejoin us.  Take him somewhere.   Maybe there\'s a workshop with pliers, a car battery  And find out where Veronica Deane is with that damn necklace!  Well, she\'s not in the basement.     Or in the attic.    Or in the refrigerator.   Why would she be in the refrigerator?  I don\'t know.  You said look everywhere.     Yeah, he\'s right.  You did.    That does sound like you.   Come on, ya rat shyster.  Move it.   But I don\'t know where she    Come on!   I\'m sorry.  How rude of me.   Would anyone else like to join Mr.  Shapiro?  But I would like to call my babysitter.     Too bad!   Could we at least use the bathroom?  You just went!  That was, like, four hours ago!  No, it was  Oh, my God!  I\'m so turned on, I think I\'m actually getting dehydrated.   When this is over, remind me to kick your tits off.   No.   Split them up, men and women.   All right.  You have five minutes.   Mr.  Nurple and Mr.  Giggles will escort you.   And so help me God, if you people try anything  Uh, yeah.  Uh, then what do you want us to do?  Wh Reprisals!  Swift and brutal reprisals!  That was clearly implied!  Where are you, Veronica Deane?  And where the hell is Pinky Brewster?  So, good news and bad news.   Bad news is, the doors and windows are hermetically sealed,  there\'s six gunmen out there whose leader is insane,  a jumpy SWAT team dying to go full on Attica,  and a room full of hostages, one of whom  which I guess shouldn\'t surprise me,  but somehow still does has coulrophilia.     Cool what?   Coulrophilia.  Apparently,  it\'s a sexual attraction to clowns.   Good news is, I got you the last slice of pepperoni and mushroom.   That\'s the good news.   I mean  relatively.    Okay, so the doors and windows are sealed.   You got six or seven of these mopes  in there, dressed as clowns.   And they let most of the hostages go.   But so far, they\'ve made no demands.   I mean, just pizza, but  And you were in charge here?  Yeah, I Wait.  What do you mean "were"?  It\'s the past tense of "are. "  Yeah.  You\'re relieved, gnome nuts.  Gimme that.     Yeah, or I could hold it, or   I\'m sorry.  Who are you guys?  The guys who haven\'t been standing around  all night with their dicks in their hands  while a simple hostage negotiation  spirals into a televised cluster fluck.     Phone.  Let\'s go.    Well, we just tried to call them,    but then we heard a gunshot, so   Gimme that.   Or I could hold that one, maybe.   Now, if you think you\'re up to the task,  go negotiate us some coffee.   And while you\'re at it, negotiate  my coffee as a cold brew, iced!  It\'s got, like, a third of the acid,  which is easier on Mr.  Tum Tums.   Now, you listen to me, pig!  If I want to talk, I will call you.   In the meantime, every time the phone rings,  I will execute a hostage and shove  their limp and bloody corpse  off the roof, on live television!  Is that clear?  Yep.   Well, how\'d it go?  Not great!    Well, how\'d it go?    Not great.     Not you!   Not great, though.     Yeah, we kicked the shit out of him.    So embarrassing.   So, pretty sure he honestly has  no idea where Veronica Deane is.   I hate to say it, but I believe you.   Shame it took us an entire spleen to get here.     Shut up.  Do you think emeralds melt?   Why?  Because I\'m about to burn this damn  house down and sift through the ashes.   So, please, can you just go find us a way out of here?  Don\'t worry.  I\'m gonna get  you out, one way or another.   In the meantime, maybe I should hold on to the Tsarina.   Why?  In case those assholes find you in here.   It\'s our only bargaining chip.   All right.  But please hurry.   I I really need to use the restroom.   Yeah.  Sorry.  I\'ve been giving that some thought,    and if I were you   Yes?    Desk drawer.    Ugh!  Oh, my God!  I hope you\'re not on septic.   Ugh! Have you no decency, man?  We said only number ones, Krieger!    I never agreed to that.    Yes, you absolutely did!    Well?   Well, what?  Well, what\'s the plan? To escape!  Impossible! Unless we can override  the controls for these panic doors.   Which Why do you even have those?  Well, I\'ve made a lot of enemies in this town.   But I think we should do what these people say.  They\'re unhinged.   If we try to escape, they\'ll kill us.     Yeah.  Plus, let Archer handle it.    Wait.  Let who?  Archer, one of my detectives.  He\'s  He\'s probably sneaking around out there, as we speak,  snapping necks and cramming ears full of ice picks.   Oh, please!  The only thing Archer\'s cramming is a very average sized dick  into Veronica Deane\'s very old twatch.   What are you talking about?  He was totally making out with her, Malory,  in front of God and everybody!    Oh.  Well, even if he was   Which he was!  I\'m sure it was only because you were  throwing yourself at Ellis Crane.   What?  Suck it, Bechdel Test.   You suck it, missy! And even though  you were flirting with Crane    like a D girl wannabe   What?  You know Sterling is somewhere in this  house, risking his life to save ours.   In fact, I bet he\'s already taken out a clown,  put on his clothes and mask, and infiltrated the enemy.   Five minutes is up.  Let\'s go!    Oh, for God\'s sake!   Ugh, wasn\'t done!  Hmm? Infiltrated the enemy, huh?  The what?  Enema! Just talking about enemas, and, uh,  how clean and fresh they make you feel.   I mean, not you, per se, but people,  ya know, in general, I guess.   And kids, also, maybe.  I don\'t know  what kids are into these days.   Are whippits still a thing? Point is  shitter\'s clogged!  Okay, so  first I need to stash the Tsarina, which  ha ha, ho ho ho  don\'t know what I was expecting.   Okay, now to see if I can override the security system  and get those steel doors open.   Okay, okay, so, then, let me throw this out there  and see if the cat licks it up: we cut the power.     To the house   Zerp!  And, by extension, then, the steel doors.   Oh, right.  They are electric.   Yeah, so do you and kitty wanna lick me  through how that\'s supposed to work?  And so, now, what was your idea?  Two squads of six, breach formation,  shape charges on steel doors here and here,  detonate, ingress, take out hostiles  with flash bangs, and/or beanbags,  secure the friendlies, achieve  egress, drop mic.  We\'re out.   Yeah.  The second you blow the doors,  they\'re gonna execute everybody.   Which is the tactical equivalent of  a cat puking on your duvet cover.   Come on.  Let\'s go.  Here we go.  Move it, move it, move it.   Let\'s go, ladies.  Move it, move it, move it.  Let\'s go!  Hang on.  I got a big old wad of toilet paper stuck on my shoe.     Ugh!   Seriously.   And I really need to check in with my babysitter, so    Typical.    Shut up.   Make me.  Ow!  Hey, knock it off, you two!  Damn it! I said knock it off!  Make me.  Ow!  Okay! Jesus!  Ooh! Looks so good!  Well  hope I\'m not allergic to clown blood.     S\'up, ding dong?   Wh Why the hell are you in here?  I heard you were getting your ass beat.   Oh, for the  What is this, NORAD?  Damn it.  You\'d have to be, like  Ray!  Hang on.  I had something for  Was it Ain\'t Two Dee Two?  Eh    Okay, so, if you\'re right   Which  Merely for the sake of argument, let\'s say you are,  and Archer has infiltrated these guys  We have to find out which one is him.   Which  Ow! Hey, cut it out.   Ow! Come Ow! Damn it! Come on!  That\'s Ow! Okay! Ow!  What is he doing? Sterling\'s got the  rest of his life to slap Cyril.     No! No!    Excuse me.     Okay! Stop! Ow! Ow!   Excuse me, green one?  She needs the bathroom again.   You just went!    I know, but   She has diarrhea!  Ugh!  Seriously.     Ya know   What? You were the one  shoving pizza in your gob like it owed you money.   Doesn\'t even makes sense.   Giggles, go with her.   Yes, you! Idiot!  Psst!  Ready when you are.   Blech.   Seriously.   Did you see that? Malory just winked at that guy.     Do you think she\'s in on the caper?   Or just giving him props  for slapping the dog piss outta Cyril.   Yeah, that does make more sense.   But either way, not cool.   Welp.   Stay cold, Pony Boy.   Eh  Okay, now I just gotta find Archer.     What?   I said, here is good.     So go ahead.    Huh?  Okay.  How about for starters,    "I\'m sorry I kissed that old woman"?   Mm, okay.   "I don\'t know what got into me.  I can only assume  it was my repressed desire to sleep with my own mother. "  Uh    Okay.    Wow!  So this is all just a big joke to you, huh?  Meanwhile, I guess we get killed by a bunch of clowns,  and A. J.  gets to go live in an orphanage!  Well, if we live through this, we  are gonna have a long talk, Archer.     Who?    "Who"?  Quit dicking around.   I know you took out the green clown, and and  Oh, shit!    Rompers!    Goddamn it!  I said radio silence!  Your hands are so big!  Son of a bitch ass clown!  Ugh! Finally!  Jesus! No wonder Mozart went deaf.   I swear to God, one more word out of you,  and you\'ll have to have your brain\'s  mail forwarded to the ceiling!  That was technically not a word.   And what really chaps my cheeks,  besides ruining that dress,  is now I have to have that exact same  stupid argument all over again with Archer!  But first I gotta figure out which  one of these scrote licks is him.   And then I am gonna let him have it!  And then, boom, we\'re outta here.   And then Veronica Deane\'s like,  "Archer, you saved me and the Tsarina!"  And then she swoons, and I catch  her, and there is a moment, and  Honestly, I don\'t see what could possibly go wrong.   Look, we\'re running out of time here.   Those perps gotta be panicking by now,  and panic equals dead hostages.   Yeah, well, so does barging in there  with shape charges and flash bangs.   Okay.  Okay.  So, then, I\'m gonna  just throw this out there,  knockout gas!    Knockout gas.    Yeah.   In the, uh whatcha madoo HVAC.     Ooh! Or how bout a freeze ray?   Uh  Yeah, we just freeze \'em into giant  icicles and hit \'em with a hammer.   Do we Do we have that technology?  Son of a Could\'ve sworn this  hallway led back to the foyer.   Or maybe the dining room?  How the hell did I get so turned around?  Oh, and bigger question:  how the hell am I gonna tell which clown is Archer?  You didn\'t think about that, did ya, Poovey?  I\'m sorry.  I honestly thought  knockout gas was an actual thing.   Idiot.  Some kind of drug, maybe, but  No, no, no, not the phone!  Oh, shit.  Right.  Limp, bloody corpses.   Okay, so, uh, hey, uh  Listen, I bet you guys are getting  pretty hungry in there again, huh?  Uh, is he joking?  I hope not.  I can actually eat.   And speaking of, where is Pam?  So, what say we, uh, send in some  more hot pizzas? What do ya say?  I bet that\'s them!  Go for Harris.  Uh huh.   Uh huh.  Uh huh.   No, no, no.  No, yeah, I got it.   Yeah.  Mm hmm.  Mm hmm.   Yep.     He said no.    Aah!  And that even if they did want pizza  for the hostages, which they don\'t,  the perps wouldn\'t eat it \'cause they  know we\'d put sleeping pills in it.   Damn it!  What about calzones?  Ow! Come on!  I don\'t think his problem was with the food shape.   I don\'t know.  I couldn\'t hear him!  Not the one hogging the phone.   Okay.  All right.  Did I, or did I not, let you drive?  Okay, cowboy, let\'s do it your way.   Out effing standing.   Bravo One, Bravo Two, listen up.   I\'m sorry, boss.  We just can\'t find her.   Or Pinky or Giggles or Yum Yum,  which is kind of creepy since  this place is on lockdown.   Ah, but doesn\'t the cunning rat  find his way off a sinking ship?  I think that\'s mostly via ropes?  Sinking, Oingo, as are my dreams,  into the icy black waters of failure.   For though mightily I toil and strive,  the Tsarina shall not be mine.   So, uh, what do we do now?  I guess we go with Plan X.   Uh  w what\'s Plan X?  Oh, for  Eat a dick, mansion.   Said the spider to the clown.   What, did I walk onto the Titan  Holy shit house! That must  be Archer and a bad guy!  But which is which? Should I shoot one  wait or both?  Just blow off everybody\'s kneecaps  and then apologize to one of \'em?  Wait, what am I saying? All the other  bad guys will hear the shotgun!  Well  Aw, damn it!    Holy shit snacks!   Wh Pam?    Archer?   No?  Goddamn it!    You idiots!   Us?  The only idiot in here  is the one who made out with Veronica Deane!  Hey, first of all, she kissed me.  I didn\'t kiss her.   But even if I did kiss her, which I didn\'t,  it was because you were flirting with Ellis Crane!    He was flirting with me!   Oh, my God!  Oh, my God! Seriously?  I wish I\'d blown off both of you guys\'s kneecaps.     Jesus.    Not cool, Pam.   Oh, eat my asshole!  Now what are we gonna do about the hostage situation?  Oh, right.   All right.  My guys are in position  and ready to blow the doors on your command.   On whose command? Who the hell is in charge here?  Well, sir, I think, technically, you.     But this guy\'s been calling the shots.    What?  Yeah.  So, uh, yeah.  We\'ll just leave you to it.   Who the hell were those guys?  Don\'t shoot! Don\'t shoot!  We\'re coming out.  They let us go.   That\'s what happened, and we\'re just some innocent hostages.   You really think this is gonna work?  It will if you shut your fat mouth.   Are there any more hostages inside?  Mm, nope.  Just those hideous clowns.   We\'re gonna die, we\'re gonna  die, we\'re gonna die, we\'re gonna die    Oh, shut up!   Seriously!  But when the SWAT team smashes in here and yells,  "Drop your weapons," we won\'t be able to,  and then they\'re gonna shoot  us, and we\'re gonna die!  We\'re gonna die! We\'re gonna die    Oh, my God, he\'s right.    Yeah, that\'ll happen.   What the shit?  Uh, why is everybody clowns?  Go, go, go, go, go!  No, no, no!  Oh, no!  No, no, no, no!  Don\'t shoot!  Come on! No!  No!  This was my  third best birthday.   And, so, what did we learn?    If anything.    Well, for starters, beanbags.   How the hell is that a toy for kids?  Guess we\'re lucky the police don\'t shoot lawn darts.   Oh, thank God, he\'s right about something.   Or horseshoes.     Note to self    Krieger!  What? That was an unrelated note to self!  Lawn dart rifle.   Ugh! Are we at least gonna get paid  back for all of our medical bills?  Sterling is with Shapiro as we speak,  presenting him with an itemized bill.   But you must realize, Mr.  Archer,  I won\'t pay one thin dime of this.   Oh, I\'m sorry.  I forgot.  It\'s opposite day.   Which means a bunch of cops didn\'t shoot  the shit out of me with beanbags, which  How is that a kid\'s toy? Which means I don\'t know  you hired those clowns to steal the Tsarina!  But h how did you know?  I didn\'t.  You just told me.   Oh, damn it!  Yeah.  Not great.  For you.   I mean, when Veronica finds out you did this.   I did it for her.   She\'s broke.   My God, she\'s got all these bills to pay  health insurance, a huge mortgage  She can\'t eat a bunch of diamonds and emeralds.   So you hired those clowns to steal  it, to get the insurance money  Old clients of mine.  I got \'em out of jail,  but then they double cross me.     And now I bet they\'re gonna kill me!   Yeah, probably.   So, the Tsarina is worth  I mean, like, four million.   And you were gonna pay the clowns, so you didn\'t have to worry  about the cops or the insurance company?  Like, a s four hundred grand?  Yeah.  So, I\'m gonna need a half a million in    I don\'t know.  Have you got Krugerrands?   I mean    yeah.    Super.  So, that.   And then, if you hear from Rompers and his gang    Which   you let me know.     I owe him one.    So, you\'ll protect me?  No.  I\'ll protect Veronica Deane.   Oh, so, did she ask about me, or  Did she  Oh, Mr.   She  Whew! No.   There\'s a nice way to do that.1 You have no idea who this person is.     No.    Or what this is about.   Mm, no.   "Zissner, office, meeting, 10:00. "  And you have no idea what that means.   I feel like I made that very clear.   Unlike this cryptic idiocy!  Why do you even bother to answer the phone?  Because you scream at me when I don\'t!  Volume! Jesus!  My God, Lana, you look like hell.   Like I\'ve been saying for years.   Woman, you do not want to light this particular fuse.   A. J.  was up all night with the croup.   Did you give her bourbon?  You know, I was going to, and then I realized  that, no, I wasn\'t going to.   Always worked for Sterling.   And you\'re just gonna    Yeah, too sleepy.    What is this?  "Zissner"? Wait, as in Don Zissner?  She has no idea.   Which, again, very clear on that.   He\'s a huge producer.  He makes those massive, stupid, sharky blockbusters.   Sharknoid, Sharknoid 2, Sharknoid 3 In 3 D, Sharknoid 4, Shark    We get it!   Let me finish.  Sharknoid Five.   Is that who we\'re meeting with?  Maybe.   Hm, "Zissner, office, meeting, 10:00. "  That\'s all Carol told you?  Yes, we\'re to meet Zissner in his office at 10:00.     But other than that   We have no idea.   Or why she even bothers to answer the phone.   Well, otherwise Mother screams at her.     Good morning.    Hi,  Cyril Figgis, Figgis Agency.   We have a 10:00 with Mr.  Zissner?    Maybe.    I\'m sorry?  I\'m sorry?  I\'m sorry.  Is this the Figgis Agency?    Maybe.    Then I think I have a 10:00 appointment.   I\'m Barbie Zissner.   Oh!  Oh, please forgive me, Miss    Mrs.    Mrs.  Zissner, of course, yes.   Mrs.  Donald Zissner.   Yes.   Your 10:00 is here.   I know.  Thank you.   You\'re welcome.   Gentlemen, thank you for coming.   First off, killer marketing campaign.   Goddamn it.   Second, you\'ve each been given a non disclosure agreement to sign.   If any of you repeat anything said in this room,  I will skull rape you so hard, legally speaking,  that your great great grandchildren  will spend their short, miserable lives  as indentured servants to mine.   Is that clear?    Yes, sir.    Okay.   Third  I\'m not really sure how to put this,  so I\'ll just go ahead and say it.   I think my husband is cheating on me.     That\'s so sad.    Oh.   I think my wife is cheating on me.   No.   And so I want to hire you.   To catch her in the act.   I\'ll need video confirmation, of course.   So you want us to follow him and  No, not just follow her.   More than that.  Much more.   There\'s just too much at stake here.   I have to be a hundred percent sure.   And so I want one of you    to seduce my husband and tape it.    To seduce my wife and tape it.   Aw, man.  Lousy timing.   My bush looks like I\'m sitting on Jerry Garcia\'s face.    Because A, it\'s super skeevy, and  And B, possibly extremely lucrative!  She agreed to pay us $20,000.   And Zissner\'s worth God knows how many millions,  so if we can wedge ourselves into that divorce  And he tells two friends.   And she tells two friends.   And so on and so on and so on.   I thought you said the divorce business was shabby.   If it\'s poor people.   So what, you think you\'re literally gonna pimp me out?    Who says she\'s pimping you?   Why does she get to get pimped out?  I\'m sorry.  Is there another option?    Uh, boosh?   And or kakow?  Pam, please, this is serious.   Uh, wha  I am serious.   Cyril, come on.  You can\'t do it.   Zissner wants us to prove his wife\'s cheating on him,  not that she\'s capable of aspirating her own vomit.   So what, you\'re going to do it?  Well, I mean, I think we should put our best foot forward here.   Or at least our best five inches.   Hey oh!  Who are you, Wheeler and Woolsey?    Who?   Typical.   So you\'re just gonna cheat on Lana.   Oh, right.  Goddamn it.   I mean, even if Archer did basically cheat on me with Veronica Deane    Oh, please.    One kiss.   I refuse to stoop to his level.   Lana, it\'s $20,000.   I don\'t care if it\'s  Okay, I almost said 20 million,  but obviously I would bang him for that.   Ah ha! So you do have a price.   Yes, duh, but it\'s not 20 grand, Ron Measly, so you can count me out.   Welp, guess I\'m gonna need a bucket of ice  and a roll of gaffer tape.     For?   D I Y Brazilian.   When it\'s this bushy, the clippers just get stoved up.     Ew.    Pam!  Well, I\'m sorry.  I didn\'t know I was going to get called up    to the big show.    Nobody\'s calling you anywhere.   I don\'t know.  I think Pam\'s got a better chance  of seducing Zissner than Gluella DeVil over here.   Are you insane?  No, I\'m dead serious.   I\'ll bet you my share of the 20 grand  that Ray can seduce Barbie Zissner before you.   What\'re you I\'m not in this!  If we win, you get his share.     That\'s almost $7,000.    I    Where\'d you get 7,000?   I divided 20 by 3, Cyril.   Come on, this is pretty basic stuff.   Three.  Tuh what, we\'re just not telling the women about this?  Why would we?    Hm? Hm.    Yeah, screw them.   Ray, come on.  Be a team player.   We can drink you through this.   Would you have sex with a man for $7,000?  I would if it had a negative impact on Cyril.   Wha You hate me so much  that you would actually have sex with a man.   I would date him.   And I wish y\'all every happiness,  but I am not sleeping with that woman, so    So then Krieger!   What?  My share against yours.   I bet Krieger can seduce Barbie Zissner before you.   You are on!  Yeah, I am all over that action.   Ha! Then it\'s a bet.     I got I got Krieger   I got Cyril  I\'ve got Pam.  And you\'ve got Cheryl.   Oh, please, Carol couldn\'t seduce a Spaniard.   Me, on the other hand  Only if Zissner\'s into archeology.   You little All right, Lana, you have a bet.   I\'ll take Carol, and we will laugh all the way to the bank.     And we\'re not telling the men?   Why would we?    Well, yeah.    Mm hm.   Oh, man.   I\'m gonna seduce the dick off that dude.   Oww!  Yes, what mere mortal could resist  that cornucopia of nature\'s treasures.   Exactly.   Ow!  Okay, so if anybody asks, it\'s Cyril\'s birthday,  and he asked us to take him to a strip club.   They\'ll buy that.  It\'s so sad and pathetic and Cyril y.   Uh, first of all, I dated Lana for three years.   She knows when my birthday is.   I think you wildly overestimate that relationship.   With who, Veronica Deane?  With whom.  And, no, not Veronica Deane,  who, by the way, Lana, kissed me,  and also when is Cyril\'s birthday?  Uh, how should I know?  Trick question.  It\'s today.   And we\'re taking him to a strip club  because he is both sad and pathetic.     Typical.    Oh, man.   Give my regards to all the molestees.   Wait.  Where are you guys going?  None of your collective beeswax.   Wow, that was way easier than I thought it would be.   Although, I guess so is everything.   Krieger?  Krieger.  Krieger!  Yep! Yep, yep, yep!  Hey, guys.   Shut up and brush your teeth, comb your beard,  and get some cologne on those balls.  You\'re coming with us.   Done, done, done, done,  and where exactly are we going?  Well, first to buy you some clothes.   And then wait.  Where are we going?  Uh, let\'s see.  Zissner said she\'d be  at the "The Swindon Hotel for happy hour. "  The Swindon? Nice.  Sunset Lounge or main bar?  Uh, let\'s see.  It says here "main bar. "  So, hey, should I get some new clothes?  Cyril, the answer to that question is almost always yes.   You know, Thoreau said, "Beware of all enterprises that require new clothes. "  Krieger, nobody gives a shit about Doonesbury.  Now, come on, chop chop.   Ooh, chop chop what? What are we chopping?  Nothing.  You\'re going to have sex.   With a person?    What are you   I\'m gonna double the bet.     What bet?   No, shut up.   I would think "person" was implied.   Yeah, no, I just didn\'t wanna get in that head space  and then, you know  No, I don\'t.     Double it!   No!  What bet?  Okay, if you can seduce this woman    Whoo.    Yeah.   And if you seduce her before Cyril does,  you get five, uh, hundred    Whoo.    Thousand.     Whoo hoo   Goddamn it.  Dollars.   I\'m in.  I can use the money  to finish my Voight Kampff machine.   Or not that.   Forget I said that.   Now, remember, Carol.  The key here, as with most things,  is confidence.  Which Pam\'s got by the shitload.   For reasons known but to God.   Well, a lot of it\'s the Brazilian.   They really make you feel sexy.   At least until the ingrown hairs turn me back into Bumplestiltskin.     B ugh.    I want to double the bet.   Deal.     Damn.    Just damn or daaaaaaamn!  Whichever is worse.   Damn, Cyril!  Really? You don\'t    think it\'s too much?   I You know, I think it would be.     I wanna double the bet.    No.     Give you five to two odds.    No! Krieger, get out here!    Goddamn it.    Five to one!  Dude, take it! I feel amazing.   And confidence is the key.   And Thoreau was a idiot.   Shoo! Shoo! Shoo!  No, Lana dear, listen.   All this nonsense about doubling the bet.   What, are you trying to welsh on me?    Huh Well, now who\'s a racist?   That\'s not racist.     It is if you\'re black.    There are black Welsh people.     Name one.    Uh, Shirley Bassey.     Name 20 more.    No, the bet stands.   And that is just fine with us.   Damn.   I know.  I look like a whore.   As a matter of fact,  I\'m willing to double it again.   Um  Psst.  Lana, come here.   Come here, come here, come here, come here.   Take the bet.  Double it.   Is this mirror not working or  Don\'t be shitty.  I\'m in progress.   And plus, Jerkleton, I\'ve got this.   Spanish Fly.     Right?   Pam, that shit doesn\'t work.   Yes, it does.   We just need to mix it with some mole\'s blood.   So hey, what were you saying about un doubling the bet?  Not a word.   I\'m serious, Ray.  I\'m about to punch you  in the face with your own fists.   First of all, you are a mean drunk on germicide.   It\'s blue Curaao, you dumb idiot.   Giuseppe keeps it in the back for me.   Well, then you\'re a mean drunk on blue Curaao.   I know.  I\'m actually banned for life from Willemstad.   Well, their loss.  Now, come on.  Put your money where your fat blue mouth is.   No, we\'re not doubling the bet.   Come on.  Don\'t you have faith in your man?  Shoo, shoo!    Shoo, shoo, shoo! Shoo!   Krieger!  Shoo.  Sh  I do not, no.   Well, I\'ve got faith in mine.   Cause he is lookin\' muy Rico Suave.   Oh, well, gracias, amigo.   Pff.  More like Rico not Suave.   He said like a drunk jealous bitch.   I\'m not drunk! Wait, I am drunk.   Cyril, you need any last minute pointers?  Ha! From you?  The quarry may change but never the hunt!  Hm, let\'s see.   Oh, here\'s one.  When do I start negging her?  "Negging"? Jesus Christ, what grade are you in?  Why don\'t you try putting some Spanish Fly in her Brass Monkey?  I think you mix it with mole\'s blood.   What\'re you Where the hell would you get mole\'s blood?  Why, you need some?  I need you to get your big, bushy Bob Ross ian head  out of your ass, because we\'ve got a bet to win!  And also, Giuseppe, I\'m pretty sure this is actually germicide, so    What?   Damn it, Archer.   Yeah, that\'s not great.   Although, silver lining bet I could eat a whole big bowl of germs right now.   Okay, let\'s go seduce this broad.   Okay, let\'s go put some stank on it.   Yes, I suppose this is as attractive  as these two are ever going to be.     Unless we can find some mole\'s blood.    No.     I have some.    No!  Oh, wait.  This is vole\'s blood.   I swear to God, you people.   Taxi!  Man, I don\'t feel so great.   Wonder if that\'s got anything to do  with all that germicide you drank.   Honestly, even if it had been Curaao,  I bet I\'d still be a little oogy.   No shit, you killed all your good flora.   Hey, Spirou, where\'s the main bar?    Through the lobby to the left, sir.    Thanks.  Cyril, tip the young man.   Oh, uh  Darn.  I must\'ve left my wallet in my other clothes.     Uh   Typical.   Here you go.   Here you go, ladies.  Hotel Swindon.   Well, it\'s about time.  Pay the man, Lana.   Uh, I don\'t uh, Pam? I\'ll get the next one.   Yeah, me too.  Pony up, neckbone.   Yoo hoo, bellboy, which way is the Sunset Lounge?  Fair\'s 18. 50, Miss.   Okay, so, do you have change for 10 let me finish drams of vole\'s blood?  Did he say to the right or to the left?    I thought he said right.    He said to the left.     Thanks, Lois and Clark.    It\'s Lewis and oh.     See what I did there?   What are you doing here?  I\'m gonna assume it\'s some sort of costume birthday party?  It\'s not my birthday!  Then why\'s Krieger dressed up like Evil Nazi Bob Ross Knievel?  Why are you dressed like a prostitute?    It\'s for work!   Wait, what are you all doing here?    Lunch?   It\'s 5:30.     Dunch?   Mother, what the hell is going on?  I could ask you the same thing.     Oh, my God.    What\'s he doing here?    Mr.  Zissner?   What\'s the deal here, Figgis?  Wait, you two know each other?  Uh, well, um    Donny?   Babe.     Wait.    Uh, what?   What the  Why aren\'t you in the bar?  I heard all this commotion out here.   Why aren\'t you in the Sunset Lounge?  Okay, obviously there\'s been some sort of misunderstanding here, so    Wait a minute.    I think the best thing at this point  is for everybody to    un clump.    Did he hire you to bang her?    Uh   Hey, no!  Before you answer that, remember you signed  an extremely punitive non disclosure agreement.   Yes.  And also tape it.     Goddamn it!   Shut up.   And you were just going to do it?  Not me.  Cyril or Krieger.   Ah! As if.     I mean, maybe blondie here.    As if.   Wait, but she hired us to seduce him.     And tape it.    Shut up!  Why would anyone do such a thing?  It\'s your basic cuckold fetish porn.   How is that basic?  In fact, I bet they do these hookups in the same hotel  at the same time so they know the other one\'s doing it.   Stop talking!  And they each go upstairs with whoever,  make a tape, and then go home  and watch them together.   Goddamn, I wish I was married!  You are all so frickin\' sued!  Shut up.  And you were just gonna do it?    Not me!   Wha Mother?  No, you idiot! One of those two.   Who?  Scarrah Fawcett and Baby Huey?  Hey! Whoa whoa whoa  Uh uh.   Bitch, you better \'pologize!  Or what?  Or this!  Aah!  Shoo! Shoo! Shoo! Sha! Sha!  Szhee!  Shoo! Shoo! Shoo! Shoo!  Come on, Lurch.  Let\'s see what\'s in that belly of yours!  Shoo! Shoo! Sha! Sha!  Enter Sandman.   My eyes!

Sha! Sha!  I gotta say,  I think that went about as well as it could have.   Tell that to Carol!    Whoa, gross.    Oh, God.   Oh, this is vole\'s blood.     I hope.    That\'s disgusting.   Well, whom or whatever\'s blood it is,  I vote we go rinse it off with a mojito.   Come on, we can still catch  Uh happy hour.   Seriously, worst happy hour ever.  And I hate to do it,  but I have to trash you guys in my online review.   Thanks.  And also sorry, but I don\'t feel like you\'ve earned a tip, so  Will you shut up and come on!  Wasn\'t six hours in this hell hole enough?  That bail is paid, and now I would like to go home, please!  Okay! I\'m not the one taking all night to give me back my stuff!  No, you\'re just the one  who started the brawl that got us all arrested.   First of all, that brawl started  when Carol messed up the messages.   No, I did not.   Zissner, meeting, office, 10:00?  What, were you being intentionally vague?    Eh, duh.    What?  I wanted to see what would happen.     Oh, goddamn.    Really?  Well, excellent work.   You just ruined our entre  into the world of high priced Hollywood divorces!  Which, come on, we\'re better than that.   Shooooo, wahhhhh    Are we?   I am.   I drank a whole big thing of germicide.     Shooo   What?  That would\'ve killed a normal man.   Shooo, whoo whoo whoo whoo1 [Archer yawns, groans]  [Cyril] Archer, hey, I\'m glad you\'re here.     I\'m sure you are.    Because I could kind of use your help.   I\'m sure you could.  But unless it\'s helping you leave me alone  until I finish my breakfast burrito, I    It\'s actually about your mother.    Oh.  Is she in this burrito?    No, but   Then sorry.  My hands are tied.   I wouldn\'t go in there if I were you.   Cyril, if you were me, I\'d drink a bunch of antifreeze  and then jump off a bridge, holding a giant toaster.   [whirring, beeping]  Oh, not you, buddy.  Not  you!  In the well toned flesh.   Aaahh! [grunts]  On second thought, I will have a glass of that.   Oh, good.  I do hate to drink alone.   [clears throat] I\'m here.   Well, but this is a Grande Cuve, so [chuckles]  Cheers!  And here\'s to a lucrative reunion.   [Archer] And here\'s to what the shit?  Why is Slater here? Why are you drinking champagne with him?  And may I please have some of said champagne?  In reverse order, no, I was mildly thirsty, and he wants to hire us.   To do what, kill another scientist?  And whose fault was that?    I don\'t remember.    Well  But whatever CIA bullshit you want  us to do, Slater, the answer is no.     Well, let\'s at least hear him out.    [laughs]    Are you literally insane?   No, but I\'ll tell you what is,  A. J. \'s tuition for Country Day preschool.   Wait.  I thought she was banned from there.   She was, until we made a sizable donation    to their endowment fund.    Wh How sizable?  Uhh, we should probably hear him out.     Goddamn it.  What?   Okay.   I assume you\'re all familiar with The Manchurian Candidate?    The Frank Sinatra movie?   Oh, my God.   How the hell does this have anything to  do with a movie about three sailors,  Gabey, Chip and Ozzie, who fall  in love with three crazy gals,  Ivy, Hildy and Claire, during a  24 hour shore leave in New York?  Oh, and it\'s a musical?  That\'s On the Town!  And also Bea Benaderet\'s film debut.   Jethro\'s mom? Uh, Tweety\'s Granny?    You done?   Yes.     Okay, so   Kate Bradley?    [sighs]   Mrs.  Barney Rubble?    Thanks for the champagne.    No, no, no! Wait, wait!  He won\'t say another word.     Please, don\'t go.    [sighs] All right.   But only because my other options are somehow even worse.   So, what do you want us to do?  Short answer, prevent World War III.   And longer answer Where\'s the, uh  Oh.  Sorry.   Help me prevent a former CIA agent,  Ken Hinkins, who was brainwashed in the MK ULTRA program,  from assassinating a visiting Soviet dignitary,  thus triggering a chain of geopolitical events  that would lead to World War III.   So, questions? Comments?  That aren\'t about Bea Benaderet?     [Archer] So, listen, I know the CIA sucks at everything,  but can they really not find this Hinkins guy?    Why\'d you come to us?   Well, for one thing, I saw this.     Goddamn it! Give me that!   And obviously,  the agency could find him, ass, but this is off the books.   Wait.  As in illegal, or  [chuckles] Lana, everything the CIA does  within the borders of the United States is illegal.   Especially Project MK ULTRA!  Wait.  MK ULTRA  That was the CIA\'s mind control program, right?  Yeah, it\'s since been, uh, discredited, but  [laughs]    Discredited for being batshit crazy!   It wasn\'t  And for being in direct violation of the Nuremberg Code,  which was written because of medical  experiments by Nazi war criminals,  many of whom, after World War II  spoiler alert came to work for the C I goddamn A!  Wait, what?  Look, the Soviets were kicking our ass in the Cold War.   Our scientists had to think outside the box.   Oh, is that the box where they kept informed consent?  Because I\'m pretty sure that all those mental patients  the CIA force fed LSD didn\'t give it!    Wait, what?   Mental patients, Lana.   They gave them LSD every day for six months.   Not six months.  The longest one was only    a hundred and seventy four days.    That is six months.   Oh, and what about Project Artichoke, before Ultra,  where you dick bags got innocent people addicted to morphine?  Look, all that crazy drug stuff was  intentionally "secretly" leaked  to divert attention from the  real goal of Project MK ULTRA,  which was mind control through hypnosis and torture.   Is that supposed to make it better?  It\'s not supposed to make it anything!  Take a right on Sunset.   [tires screeching]  No, but for real, though, the CIA  really drugged and hypnotized people?  Oh, please! That\'s merely the tip  of a very dark and twisted iceberg.   Trust me, if there\'s a hell, those  creepy Dulles brothers are in it.     Doing unspeakable things with bananas.    [sighs]  Then why would you decide  without even consulting me, the owner of the agency  to work for the CIA again?  Because my pool needs to be retiled.   And all new coping, whatever that is.   I don\'t know.  I mean, I\'m not saying  you can\'t zap somebody\'s brain with LSD  Oh, my God, even a baby knows that.   But nobody can hypnotize me if I didn\'t wanna be.   [scoffs] Are you kidding? I could  hypnotize everybody in this office.     No, you couldn\'t!   Oh, you can\'t!  No, but without psychotropic drugs.   Or your goddamn brain chips, like you  made that rabbit a vegetable with.   Well, and also a human being.     No, none of that.  Just pure hypnosis.    [overlapping responses]  But if I can hypnotize you, you all  have to come see my one man show,  Jo Jo Dancer, Ihr Leben Ruft!    Oh [muttering]   Dude, is that blackface?    Yep!   Whoa!   What the shit, man?  But you have to hypnotize each of us,    everybody here in the office?   Yep, yep, yep!    Okay.  Then you\'re on.    Sweet!    Wait, what?   Yes! He said everybody.   [Malory] Who do I have to murder around here  to get this damn thing to make ice?    [exclaims in German]   [cackling]    [droning]   Whoa!    [gasps]   What is happening?    God!   Oh, I gotta go!    [screams]   [droning continues]    They gone?   Yep.   [exhales] So, then, to repeat,  I demand immunity from this idiotic Jo Jo Dancer bullshit.   Dang! You don\'t have to be hurtful.   I feel like I do.  And how do you think you\'re gonna pull this off?  Scopolamine, the zombie drug.   What? Are you kidding me?  Ugh! Are you?  [Slater] Man, Veronica Deane.     Remember her in Shanghai Moon?   Oh, my God.     That dress?   Right?  Yeah.  Tell him how you kissed her.     What?   First of all, she kissed me.     My ass!   My mouth.  Wait.   I mean And I thought we were over that.   Well, apparently you\'re not.   I didn\'t cast her in Deadly Velvet.   Which, do you think they\'re currently  in principal photography on that, or  I think it\'s neither the time nor the  place nor the Slater to discuss it!  I\'m not the one who brought it up!    You are exactly the one!   First of all  Could you both please shut up and do what I hired you to do?  Which, if you already knew Hinkins was here  He\'s not.  But there\'s somebody up  there who should know where he is.     Yeah, Lana.  Ow!   [sighs]  Archer, your professionalism never ceases to amaze me.   [gasps] You know what\'s amazing?  Magnets! Especially for dumb idiots like you.   [Archer] Okay, what\'s this guy\'s name?  Eckerd.  But follow my lead in there.   We gotta take it real easy.  These ex ULTRA guys are really jumpy, so  Hey, Eckerd, come move your goddamn car outta my spot,    you bug eyed son of a   [rifle fires]    Hey!   Now who\'s the idiot?    [rifle fires]   Whoo!  He asked, idiotly.   Wait, wait, wait!    [thudding, glass shatters]   Damn it!  Holy shit!    [grunting]   Stop it!    [Slater] Eckerd!   [gasps] Slater!  It\'s okay.  We just wanna talk.   Yeah, the gun\'s just a conversation piece.   [Pam] What? Bluntz & Blintzen?  Nice try, Krieger.  Who am I, the Road Runner?  Although if this is for real, I\'ll never forgive myself.   Goddamn it, this better not be a ruse!  All right.  There better be some damn  [sputters, spits] What the  [heart beating]  Huh.     Pamela.    Yes, Doctor.   You are under my complete control.     Yes, Doctor.    Tell Cheryl to come in here.   Hey, neck bird, come here a second!  Ugh! Why? Shut up! Why?  Uh, there\'s a mouse caught in  a trap, and he\'s still alive,  but his tiny little back\'s broken!  Where? Show me.  I wanna see it.  Where?  Eww!  [heart beating]  Huh.     Cheryl.    Yes, Doctor.   Boolean search, hypnosis,  and how to defend against, yes?  [Pam, Cheryl] Hey, Cyril, come here!  Why? Shut up! Why?  [Pam] Uh, we found Lana\'s diary!  [Cheryl] And it\'s all about your dong!  [together] Yes, Doctor.   See? Easy peasy zombie squeezy.   You still gotta get Ms.  Archer, and  she\'s not a candy ass like these ones.   She\'s 80 pounds.  This stuff  could paralyze a gorilla.     [whispers] On angel dust.    [Malory] Wha  I better not smell marijuana!  Here we go, here we go, here we go!  I swear to God, you people, the  Huh.     Malory.    Yes, Doctor.     You are under my Ow!   You son of a    [grunting]   Are you out of your mind?    What is wrong with you?   Oh ho ho!  Walk in here with you idiots smoking reefers  like a bunch of yardbirds, and you spritz me?    You spritz me?   [grunting continues]    Well, let me tell you something, Herr Doktor!   Oh!  I killed seven Krauts with a shovel,  so one more beardy son of a bitch like you    won\'t make a damn bit of difference!   [screams]    [clears throat]   [whimpering]  And you!  Any questions, little Miss Blintzen?    [rattling]   [squeaky] Mm mm.   And when I get back from lunch,  you people had better be hard at work!  [coughing]  I told your dumb ass  [inhales sharply] Yep.   Back in ten minutes.  Be ready.   Ow, ow, ow, ow.  [grunts]  Ow, ow, ow, ow.  [grunts]  Eckerd, I\'m not gonna ask you again.     Good, because I\'m not gonna tell you.    Yes, you are.   So, how\'d you know this wasn\'t a combat shotgun,  with, say, five rounds in the tube?    How would I know that?   So you just barged in?  What am I gonna do, Lana, stand out  in the hall the rest of my life?    [Slater] One.    [gun cocks]    I   Two.  Eckerd, I\'m serious.     It\'s got real bullets and everything.    I  I don\'t care.  I won\'t tell you.   Slater, is that really necessary?  Actually, no.  Could you grab me  a pitcher of water and a towel?  Wait! No, no! No! No!  No, no, no! Stop, stop, stop! Okay, okay, okay.   Please.  I\'ll tell you where he is.     Wait, what?   I\'m waiting.   He didn\'t even pour any water on you.   Yeah, and he\'s not going to.   Hinkins is at the Tuntford Arms,  room 302, under the name "Swenders. "    Okay, we can be there   Wait a minute.   You give up your buddy just because some  dickhead threatens to waterboard you?    Yes!   Are you How bad could it be?    What? Are you kidding?   Archer, it\'s    Wait.  You wait.    What?  How have you never been waterboarded?    Why would I?   What?  Gee, I don\'t know.  Training?    [chuckles] What?   Oh, my  Archer, we all had to    Where were you on waterboarding day?   Uh  No, no, no, no! Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait! Wait!  I think I\'m supposed to be somewhere.   But I also think I want the lavender  instead of the sandalwood.  Right?    Oh, who remembers?   I do.   I remember exactly where I was, Archer.   I was strapped to a board and so  convinced I was actually drowning  that I shit my sweatpants.     Wait.  Not   Yes! Literally!    Well, that sounds terrible.    It is terrible.   I can\'t believe you weaseled out of it.   That is so classic you!  [chuckles] Yeah, right? Pretty great.   So, should we go, or do you need to  bungle the invasion of Cuba first?  Mm, no.  We\'ve got a few minutes.     [cocks]   So get on the table, idiot.   [chuckles] Exqueeze me?  You heard him.   No, but seriously, don\'t feel bad  when I\'m totally unfazed by this.   Yeah, again, it\'s not gonna be  like some homoerotic prep school swirlie.   Yeah, they were kind of oddly sexual.   Gonna just leave that there? Lana?  With pleasure.   Plus, I bet this only affects women.     Really?   Well, you know, people with vaginas.     Uh huh.    However you choose to self identify.   [sighs] God, I\'m going to enjoy this.   [laughs] Well, I know you like putting stuff in guys\' mouths.     You finished?   [laughs]  I bet you ask guys that a lot.     [clears throat]   Aah!  And then clear your throat!  Okay.  All right.  I\'m ready.  Let\'s do this.   And just to reiterate, waterboarding will  not affect me in any way whatsoever.   [clears throat] And, also, you have a vagina.   [stammering] I didn\'t know it it would be like that.   I mean, you you you you hear about it,  and you hear people say it\'s bad, but you think,  "Oh, those people probably have vaginas. "  But I don\'t have a vagina! But as God is my witness,  that was the worst thing I\'ve ever experienced in my  Wait a minute! I\'ve actually drowned before!  Literally drowned! I was actually  clinically dead from drowning!  Which, looking back, I\'m kind  of surprised I didn\'t remember  when I was joking about everybody having vaginas, but    Lana   No o o o!  No, no, no, no, no.   Do not speak to me.  You have said quite enough.   Yeah, but I Oh, come on, Lana.   It is a proven fact that torture makes  you say what your captors wanna hear.   I don\'t think she wanted to hear about how you\'ve been struggling  with what you truly believe are  genuine feelings for Veronica Deane.     I   Speaking of vaginas    Were we?   Ughhh!  Oh, my God, I\'m such a fatty.   [Krieger] Ray! Ray, come in here!  Why? Shut up! Why?  [Malory] Because he said so, you little snot!    [plate shatters]   Uh    Coming!   [Krieger] And bring the others!    [imitating dogs]   Well, y\'all heard the man.  Come on!  [together] Yes, Ray.   [panting] Sorry.     I was putting away the blintzes.    I bet.     Silence, woman.    Yes, Doctor.   How did you, um  Oh, uh, just gave her another spritz.     What the   [imitating dogs]    Why are they crawling?   Oh, sorry.   I turned them into little, wiggly pugs.   It\'s okay.  I was gonna do that, too.   Hey, no! Save it for the camera.   All righty, I guess let\'s get \'em  stripped down to their unterpantzen.   [Lana] As a matter of fact, why don\'t  you just call her up and ask her out?  Lana  Take her to the Brown Derby for the early bird special,  get her some chicken croquettes.   Oh, oh, oh, and some sherbet!    Old people love sherbet!   [elevator bell dings]  She\'s, like, 50.   Million!  [scoffs] Doesn\'t even make sense.   Oh, and how old is Ellis Crane?  Moot! The question is moot,  because I didn\'t make out with Ellis Crane!  Hey, guys, as much as I\'m loving this,    what say we focus on the mission here?   I am focused, Slater!  But once we find this Hinkins guy, you can just    Whoa! Son of a   Jesus!  [sighs] You were saying?  Hinkins! Hinkins, wait! Damn it!  I\'ll take the lobby.  You two take that stairwell to the roof.     Move, move, move, move!   Who died and made you hall monitor?  Oh, shut up and come on!    He\'s going up!   Why are you still talking?  Well, that\'s a good question, Lana,  because obviously you can\'t have a  mature conversation about this.     And I know you like \'em mature!   Case in point!    And, gee, I wonder why that is.    Lana!  Paging Dr.  Freud! Dr.  Sigmund  "Oh, By The Way, Deep Down, I  Really Wanna Plow My Mom" Freud!  [laughs] That\'s not even  I didn\'t even say that while I was being waterboarded.   Well, you [gasps]  Oh, shit.  Hinkins, wait!  [Lana] Wait! No, no, no! Don\'t move! We can  You can tell Slater and the rest of those vampires at the agency  that ULTRA doesn\'t end with me!  It can never end, you see! It\'s a It\'s a Mobius strip!  An endless ticker tape, and we are the data!  The tiny pinholes  Yeah, good, keep him talking.   I\'m gonna sneak up on him from the side.   The Wait, what?    to kill me   [crunch]  Huh? [yelling]  [screaming]    [body thuds]   [car alarm blaring]  That was your plan?  Well, you didn\'t even have one.   Sometimes doing nothing is a plan!  And spoiler alert nothing is what  you should\'ve done with Veronica Deane,  instead of that pathetic little fanboy make out session at the  Ugh!  For [bleep]\'s sake!    Archer.    Hmm? What? What are we doing?    Oh, I\'ll tell you what we\'re doing.    [door opens]  Does it involve scraping a CIA asset off the roof of a Datsun Honey Bee?  [chuckles] Man, I hope not.     [grunting]   [cocks]  Uh, yeah.  So, here\'s the thing here  The thing here is that I am not paying you!    That\'s the thing here!   What the shit, Slater?  I mean, maybe it didn\'t end well for  Hinkins, if it was even supposed to  But either way, nobody got assassinated.   Yeah, good point.  But, funny story,  I wasn\'t gonna pay you anyway, so       Slater    [door closes]  Huh.  Well, the good news is    Shh.    What?  Shh, shush, shush, shush.     Do you hear that?   What?  That sound.  I think it\'s the break.   The what? What What brake?  The break that we\'re on!  Oh.  [chuckles]  Okay.  Now I get it.   I thought she was talking about the  brakes on the Datsun Honey Bee.   But, uh  nope.   [Cyril groaning]  Oh, my head.   [groans]  Hey, where the heck are my pants?  [exhales] Pants, hell.  Where\'s that damn cat?  Ugh! What cat?  The one that shit in my mouth.  [spitting]  And that may or may not be a metaphor.   Well, this sure as hell isn\'t.     [whimpering]   [growling]  [Krieger] Yep, yep, yep! Okay.   Now you\'re all birds of prey.   [all squawking]  Ja! Und Cyril ist Der Falkonmeister!  Ja, ja! Untzergrabben! Untzergrabben!  Oh, my God! You are hands down the  world\'s shittiest Falkonmeister.   What? I don\'t even remember that.   You don\'t have to.  It\'s on tape.   So now we gotta go see Jo Jo Dancer.   Which better be as racist as it looks.   And you\'re not, like, hungover, or    Why would I be?   No, I mean you wouldn\'t,  especially if you weren\'t exposed to  scopolamine or something like that.   Scopolamine? Why would I have been?  I No, yeah, no I You know, I  Yeah, exactly.  Why?  And more importantly, how?  [Krieger] Okay, that\'s Oh, come on.  Stop it.   That\'s just about enough of What  Well, that does it, missy!    You can just cool your jets in there.    Yes, Doctor.   And by "jets," obviously I mean your actual cooling jets, so  Yes, Doctor.   So, yeah, just cool your jets  Oh, and as for the rest of you  Now that I think about it, let\'s  everybody cool their respective jets.   [whirring]  Excellent.  Yes.   Yes, very good.   Well, short term, anyway.   [electricity arcs]  [continuous mechanical humming]1 [Malory] Now, then, Mr.  Crane,  tell us what the Archer Agency can do for you.     Well, I   Excuse me.   It\'s the Figgis Agency.   Cyril, please! Stop interrupting.   Now, Mr.  Crane, how can we help you?  Well, I\'m afraid that someone, or someones,  is trying to sabotage my latest picture, Deadly Velvet.   [door opens, shoes scuffle]  [chuckling] You mean besides the critics?  Huh? We\'re still in production.   It\'s a joke.  Lighten up, Fritz Lang.   [clears throat]  And what makes you suspect sabotage?  Well, as Lana can confirm  Oh ho ho, so now it\'s "Lana"?  Uh, Miss Kane, rather, who, as you know,  has recently begun working  on the picture as a technical advisor.   There\'s already been three accidents on set  which were pretty suspicious.   A fire, a camera crane collapsed  Narrowly missing several crew members.   And yesterday, there was some kind of malfunction  with a stuntman\'s airbag.   That poor devil may be paralyzed.   Well, it certainly sounds suspicious.   But why come to us? Why not the police?    I   I don\'t know, Cyril.   Maybe he wanted to be interrupted every five seconds.   I don\'t, actually.   And Ellis doesn\'t want the police involved.   Oh ho ho ho.  So now it\'s "Ellis"?  Yes, Archer.  It\'s Ellis.  And Lana.   He and I are on a first name basis,  whereas you and I are on a break!  Yeah, how you holdin\' up?    Pff.    I\'ll take that as a "barely. "  Take it however you want.   Already did, so    Could we   Cyril, I swear to God  Malory! Ellis wants to hire the agency  to go undercover on the set.   [gasps] Ooh.   You could pose as technical advisor.   I already am.     Posing.    The technical advisor.   And if someone is trying to sabotage the movie,    our job is to catch them.    Discreetly.   If the insurance company pulls the bond or, God forbid,  my investors back out, I\'ll be ruined!  Don\'t worry, Mr.  Crane.  We won\'t let that happen.   Put your faith in us.   [groans] I\'m afraid I must.   We\'ll see you there this afternoon.   Ellis, should we get back to the set?  Meh? Meh, meh, meh, meh, meh, meh?  [sighs]    And, uh, how are you holding up?   Pff.   All right, listen up.   As much as I hate, hate, hate, hate  to do this, a movie set is huge,  so we\'re going to need all of you to go undercover, so    Yay!   Oh my God, oh my God, oh my God!  [groans] So try to act like professionals.   Professional whats? What do we have to do, more work?  Well, I\'ve tried to match the various production departments  to your skill sets, such as they are,  so Cyril accounting.  Get into those books.   Find out who could benefit from cost overruns  or delays in production.   And that is exactly what I was going to tell myself to do, so  Pam craft services.   Goddamn it.   Wh I\'m the one who knows macram.   And you\'re also babysitting Carol.   Wh Why do I need a babysitter?  Because they\'ve already had one fire.   [sighs] Then why not just leave her here?  Because we\'ve already had one fire.   Now, then, Gillette  Hair and makeup, hair and makeup, hair and makeup,  hair and makeup, hair and makeup!  Finished?  Yes.  Grip.   Goddamn it!  Ooh, what about me? What about me?  Oh, you just sort of skulk around.   Oh, I will.   And I shall pose as an executive producer,  which leaves Sterling.   Yeah, it leaves him right here \'cause I\'ll be damned  if I\'m helping Lana\'s new pretend boyfriend make a movie.     Oh, that\'s too bad.    Yeah, well  Krieger, I suppose you\'ll just have to be  Veronica Deane\'s new bodyguard.     [gasps]   [car horn blowing]  Let\'s go, you dumb idiots.   Well, one of you, anyway.   The rest of you, I guess maybe carpool.   Luigi won\'t let anybody ride in the cab.   I mean, unless you\'re down for road head.   Shotgun!  [theme]   [Pam]  Lunch, hot lunch!   You get it from hot lunch Pam   Hot lunch!   [Carol] Okay.  Jesus, why are you in such  an obnoxiously good mood?  Because that crazy dago  let me drive the truck,  so I was the road head ee.   Yeah.  Win for you.   Yep.  Just one of the many perks of having a C. D. L.   What\'s a C. D. L. ?  Commercial driver\'s license.   And also a [bleep].   Ugh! You are so gross.   [chuckling] That\'s what he said.   But in Italian.   Who said what in Italian?  Don\'t ask.  You\'ll gag.   I thought maybe you dopes had stumbled  onto some sort of mafia shakedown.   We\'ve been here, like, four minutes.   Well? Anything suspicious so far?  Uh, just you?  What, I\'m a flamboyant Hollywood producer.   Not the world\'s tiniest drag queen?  What?  I said we\'ll keep you updated.   Well, you\'d better, missy.   Holy shit, did she just eat a grape?  Must be her cheat day.   [Archer] Man, it really looks like the \'40s.   This is weird, right?  Like the time Star Trek went to Chicago.   Or Nazi Germany, for whatever idiot reason.   Archer?  Shapiro? What are you doing here?  Protecting my client  with my colleagues, Smith & Wesson.   Oh, really, \'cause I\'d like to meet those guys.   Come on, stop.   First of all, not a Smith & Wesson.   I know, but I was going for the whole    Second of all, this.    No, no, no, no, no.   [gun clatters]  Goddamn it.   What the hell, man? I needed that.   No, you didn\'t.   Yes, I did.  This set is dangerous.   As dangerous as you with a firearm?  Are you kid  Shit\'s catching on fire.   Shit\'s falling on people.   People are falling on shit.  Like the ground.   Well, I think it\'s all just a big dumb coincidence,  but even if it\'s not, don\'t worry about [gasps]  Veronica Deane.   Yes? Oh, hello, Alan.   Wait.  That\'s why you\'re here?  Yeah, Crane hired us.   It\'s nice to see you again, Ms.  Deane.   I\'m sorry.  Have we met?  Oh, um, yeah.   I\'m Sterling Archer, private investigator.   You hired me.   Um, and then another time,  I protected you in a hostage situation,  dressed as a clown.     Is this not ringing any   Alan?  Apparently Ellis hired him to protect you during the shoot.   Other than my ex husband\'s refusal to let me get on with my life,  the only thing I need protection from is this clunky dialogue.   Thought I had a joke, but  Mr Archer, was it?  Yeah.  We actually even kissed.   I\'m sorry you\'ve wasted your time, but I can assure you  I have absolutely no need for a bodyguard, so    [man] Look out!   [gasps]  [people gasping, yelling]  You were saying?  [sighs]  [chuckling] Yeah, you were.   [man] Move those cans.  Now!  Don\'t you break my cables! Come on, people!  Move the cables! Careful!  Oh, for God\'s sakes, what now?  Looks like a runaway forklift.   [groaning] That, and I\'m pretty sure my ribs are shattered.     Like breadsticks.    Move those lights, you fools!  Oh, we\'re just hemorrhaging money.     And speaking of hemorrhaging   What in the hell happened?    A forklift.    And a forkwad.   What\'s the big idea, kicking my guts out?  When, just now? When I saved your life?    And mine.    Oh, now  Oh, please.   What\'s her problem?  How much time do you have?  [Carol] What is wrong with you?!  [grunting] What\'s wrong with you, lady?  You killed it.   It was beautiful, and you blew it out!  [screams] You maniacs!  You blew it out! Damn you!  Goddamn you all to hell!  What the hell, Tunt?  You leave me to craft all the service by myself?  I smelled fire.   You mean smoke.   Uh, no.   Oh, I can\'t believe this.   Yes, it would appear your "phantom" has struck agai  Shh shh shh shh  Back to work, you you goldbricks.   All right, you heard the man.  Let\'s go, let\'s go, let\'s go!  [people chattering]  That\'s exactly the sort of rumor  I don\'t want you spreading around.   Maybe this was just an accident.   Nah, somebody definitely tampered with it.   The brake line\'s cut, the steering wheel\'s tied off,  and the throttle linkage is jammed wide open.   Yeah, I was gonna say  linkage jam.   Says the man who pays  to have his Ferrari trucked around on a flatbed.   And how much is that costing you?  Actually, not much more than just driving it,  when you factor in all the repairs.   Plus no DUIs.   [chuckling] Well, fewer.   And shut up.   You wanna try and make me? Huh?  Now, listen here, you you rounder.   You keep a civil tone here with Ms.  Kane,  or I\'ll throw you off this set so fast you\'ll  you\'ll pass yourself going.     Wait, what?   You\'ll do nothing of the sort.   Archer is my bodyguard,  and if he goes, you can find yourself another female lead.   And on the off chance you plan to shoot anything today,  I\'ll be in my dressing room!  Archer? Shall we?  [chuckling] Yes, we probably shall.   Damn it.   Yeah, well Ellis and I will be in his dressing room, so  shall we?  Actually, my dear, I need to go meet with my investors  to cushion the blow about this,  as it were, so hmm.   So, apparently, you shan\'t.   Oh, my God, jealous much?  [laughs] Jealous.   It\'s getting hard to tell the kettles from the pots around here.   Well, usually, kettles have whistles.   If that helps.   [sighs]  Hey, Malory, do you have a minute?  "Malory"? What happened to "Ms.  Archer"?  Well, technically, they both work for me, so  So you thought today would be a good day to try on your big boy britches  right in the middle of a mystery?  That\'s my point.   I think I may have found a clue.   Well, all right, Cyril.   But you\'d better just wind in that neck, Mr.  Man.   So, Archer  would you say women, on the whole,  found him attractive?  [chuckles] Which hole?  Because yes.   Albeit grudgingly.   [sighs] And sexually, would you say  [laughing] Which hole?  [clears throat] Sorry.  What?  And would you say he\'s accomplished?  Like, is he good at plowing?  You know he\'s straight, right?    I\'m   Aww, Li\'l Baby Elton  I\'m straight.   [gasps] Okay, hypothetically  No, not Wait Look, I\'m in love with Veronica.   I have been since the first time I laid eyes on her.   I\'ll never forget that moment.   It felt like I got kicked in the chest by a mule.   Yeah, you don\'t forget a hoof to the tits.   Or shooting your first mule.   Wh [sighs] How many have you shot?  Hmm two.   Anyway, since she and Crane divorced,  I thought I might have a chance.   [laughs]  But now I\'m worried she might fall for Archer.   If she hasn\'t already.   Which  I just need a moment to change  into something more comfortable.   But, please, do make yourself at home.   Faites comme chez vouz, as the French say.   Please, take your time.   Oh, and there should be a bottle of champagne chilling.     [bottle pops]    [soft jazz]  So there is.   So you want us to quit doing our jobs  to help you cockblock Archer?  Well, I Wait.  Was that sarcastic, or    No.    Then, yeah, I\'d love that.   Really?  Enough to shoot a mule?  I mean, not that I think it\'ll come to that.   [Malory] You lost me.   [Cyril] Which I think is the whole point here.   I mean, in all my years of accounting,  I\'ve never seen anything like it.   And I\'ve seen some pretty crazy stuff.   Treating deferred revenue as earned revenue,  lapping, force balancing, uh  All right, Cyril, I get it.   Yours is a world of mystery and adventure.   But pretend I\'m not HAL 9000.   Okay, the best I can tell, basically,  the investors on this movie  will make more money if production shuts down.   From the production insurance?  It\'s insured for triple what they could hope to make at the box office.   But Crane was going on and on about not wanting to lose the insurance  Yeah, that\'s the proverbial rub.   The insurance bond is actually reinsured  by a shell corporation in Florida,  whose policy is reinsured by a shell corporation in Panama,  and so on and so on down the line  until well, I lost the trail in Liberia.   Pff.  The Cousin Oliver of Africa.   But the name of the Florida shell company is  wait for it Sandhill Crane.   So? Some panhandle trash bird?  [sighs] Not that kind of crane.  Ellis Crane.   I think he\'s behind this company  and all these so called "accidents. "  Which means he would stand to benefit if production were shut down.   He\'d make millions.   Pretty impressive detective work, if I do say so myself.   And apparently I\'m the only one who\'s gonna say it, so  Oh, get over yourself, Rain Man.   Sandhill Crane could just be a coincidence.   It\'s not enough to prove anything.   No, we need to catch Crane in the act somehow.   Maybe if we used someone as bait.   Yeah, I don\'t know.  How would that even  Where\'s Gillette?  Yeah, see? When we feather it out like that,  it really frames your face.   And I mean, with your cheekbones    [door opens]   [gasps]  What the hell are you doing?  Gripping?  [Malory] All right, Cyril.   So if Crane really is behind all these accidents,  the question is how do we catch him?  Oh, you\'re asking me.  Sorry.   I thought that was rhetorical.   Why would I be asking rhetorical questions?    Bec   That one was.   All right, so what\'s the plan, guys?  How do we stop Archer from hooking up with Veronica?  Umm  Ooh! We could throw acid in her face.   Wh Jesus.   What is wrong with you?  What? Then you swoop in and take care of her,  and then slowly, after many years,  she might fall in some weird semblance of love with you.   Yeah, I think maybe we can do better.   Okay, but the perfect is the enemy of the good.   Mm.   Ooh.  How about I seduce her?  Yeah, I don\'t think she\'s bisexual.   [scoffs] Who cares?  Plus, I bet she\'d prefer the acid.   Hey, you know what?  What are you ninnies doing?    Looking for acid.    [together] No, we\'re not.   This is no time to be taking your damn drugs, you hippie dropouts.   We think Ellis Crane might be the one who\'s sabotaging the production.   Holy shit snacks.     Who\'s Ellis Crane?   I knew it.   I mean, I didn\'t know it.  I had no idea whatsoever.   But now that you say it, it makes total sense.   But what makes you think it\'s Crane?    Well, I   Doesn\'t matter.   Or it won\'t, once we can catch him red handed,  which is what we\'re hatching a plan to do.   Ooh.  How about I seduce him?  [sighs] Pam, I doubt the man is bisexual.   [scoffs] Who care Wait, what?  And even if he were, he wouldn\'t want a blob like you.   I mean, when was the last time you even saw your penis?  I  She knows you\'re a woman, right?  I thought she did.   Wait.  You had sex with her.   Yeah, but she was all tore up drunk.   Oh, right.  Plus I was wearing a stra    Eww!   What?  Don\'t ask.  You\'ll gag.   [chuckling] She certainly did.   Who did what?  Seriously, don\'t ask.   But let me ask you this.   Do you think there\'s anything about Archer  that women would find to be a turnoff?  [laughs] Oh, you\'re serious.   Well, then, shit.  Where to begin? Umm  And there is a bit of a clock on this, so    Why?   Well, he and Veronica  have been in her dressing room for a while now.   Uh huh.   And since apparently Archer\'s penis is like a crack pipe  What, in size and/or shape?  They said if he has sex with Veronica, she\'ll fall head over heels for him.   Oh, they did, did they?  Yes.   [exhales] Did you, um  Mm hmm.   Hm.  Me too.   [chuckling] Yes, I know.   Oh, right.   Sorry about the, uh    I think it\'ll come out.    Phrasing.  Still, though.   But as much as I\'d love to lie here and bask  in this post coital glow  Right? We\'ve got champagne.   We\'re over the worst of the stickiness.   I know, but it\'s very nearly 3:00.   Really? That late?  Yes, almost exactly 3:00,  and I\'m late for a wardrobe fitting, so  So I\'ll just wait for you here, or  Um, sure.   I\'m sorry I have to run,  but it\'s almost the stroke of 3:00.   Yeah, you mentioned  Mm, mwah.  Back soon.     And I\'ll be here, slowly drying.    [door opens, closes]  Ahh  Oh, man, I can\'t believe  I just made love to Veronica Deane.   I wonder if this is how Tenzing Norgay felt.   Holy shit, I wonder if this is how Tenzing Norgay always feels.   [Lana] What, sticky?  Gulp.   You know, we could just confront Crane    with the evidence.    The flimsy evidence.   Yeah, but maybe his reaction would give him away.   Hmm.   All right.  So we just barge into his dressing room and  ambush him!  Because you said we were on a break!  So two days later, your cock\'s wet?  Oh, I\'m sorry, Lana, is there a grace period?    If there is, you neglected to tell me.    There\'s an acceptable amount of time  before you start cramming your trash dick  You never bother to consult me on anything.   And for your information, this stupid break wasn\'t my idea.   It was yours!  Because you, prolapsed rectum that you are,  are infatuated with Veronica Deane,  whose cobwebby old snooch, by the way, I can smell from here.   [chuckles] Well, it\'s not cobwebby anymore.   [growls]  [grunting, thudding]    Lana!   [Lana yelling]  So that\'s your plan.     Yeah.    In its entirety.   Yep.   We just slam the door open and say  Don\'t do it!  He\'s riddled with clap!  [Archer] What?  Um  [both panting]  [together] What?  I, um  Man, you ever do that  you walk in a room and you forget why?    [together] No.    And what are you looking at?  Wow.  It is kind of like a crack pipe.   Will you idiots please leave so I can beat this man\'s ass in private?  Oh, whatever.  I was beating your    [woman screams]   [gasp]  Mother! Move, idiots!    [Shapiro] Out of my way.    [Pam] Follow that ass.   Mother! Mother, are you all right?  Why wouldn\'t I be?  I I heard you scream.   That wasn\'t me.  It was this one.   Well, it was very upsetting.     [Shapiro] Whoa.    [Pam] Oh, my God.   [Archer] Oh.  Yeah, that is pretty upsetting.   And what the hell are you wearing?  I think technically it\'s a loincloth?  Fashioned out of a baby doll nightie.   [sighs]  Well, I\'m sorry, Mother.   I didn\'t know I\'d be going to a funeral.   I would\'ve worn a black one.   [Dietrich] Okay, people, uh, listen up.   This is now an active homicide investigation,  and while the situation on the ground may be somewhat fluid  [chuckling] Fluid on the ground, on the walls  You shut up!  Shut your mouth, or I swear to Christ in His heaven  I will personally frame you for this murder!  Hey, bub, remember?  About the thing?  [clears throat] Please disregard my previous statement.   Merely an ill advised attempt at levity.   Okay.  And in light of your various professional,  or, in some cases, personal relationships with the victim,  at the present time, you are all persons of interest.   [overlapping chattering]  Hey, hey, hey, hey.  Calm down.   He didn\'t say "suspects".  Yet.   But until we do have a suspect  Or suspects.   We are gonna have to ask you  not to leave town without checking with us.   But that\'s ridiculous.   It wasn\'t any of us.  He hired us for protection.   What, like a protection racket?  No, you  We think Crane was caught up  in some sort of insurance fraud,  all the way from here to Liberia.   Okay, okay.  And we\'re gonna be looking into all that,    but in the meantime   We\'ve all got alibis.   Then you\'ve got nothing to worry about.   Yeah, because they\'ll be easy to check.   We\'ve got an exact time of death.   But a time of death estimate  is only exact to within maybe one hour, so  Try one second, gnome nuts.   [overlapping muttering]  The victim had a defensive wound.   Bullet went right through his Rolex.   [imitates gunshot] Exact time of death, 2:14 p. m.   [overlapping chattering]  Well, my goodness, what a relief.   No, I just mean  Well, you know, the ex wife, a bitter divorce.   I\'m sure I would\'ve been the prime suspect.   But I couldn\'t have murdered Ellis.   I was with you, Archer.   Remember?  Until almost the stroke of 3:00.   Um1 DIETRICH: And so, to reiterate  HARRIS: Due to your various relationships with the victim,  Ellis Crane, both professional and personal  DIETRICH: You are all persons of interest in an active homicide investigation.   (ALL GRUMBLING)  Wait.  Can\'t you eliminate us by testing our hands    for gunshot residue? Hmm?   Wha Y Yes!  Yes, we can.   And that\'s exactly what we\'re gonna do, smart guy.     So   Think you\'re so goddamn smart.   So we\'re gonna need everybody to come down to the station,  so, uh, we can test your hands for gunshot residue!  Yeah, hi.  Alan Shapiro, attorney for Veronica Deane?    God, she is so great!   Huge fan.  Huge!    Ohhh!   Yeah.  Super.   But my client will not be frog marched into a police station  like a common criminal before God knows how many cameras,  every one of which was tipped off by the LAPD!  I I Well, no.  No.  (COUGHS)    We wouldn\'t want that.    She will, however  consent to the test being conducted at my office.   Thank you.  That\'s very accommodating.   Get a load of Obi Wan Attorney.   So, should we head there now, or  No, let\'s say tomorrow.  Elevenish?    Elevenish it is!   Looking forward to it.     Are you kidding me?   How is that fair?    Why does she get special treatment?   Because she is special.     She\'s a movie star!   Yeah.  Because she\'s special.   Well, I don\'t really want to go down to the police station either, so  Goddamn it! You will comply!  Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey hey It\'s all good, buddy!  She\'s comin\' down to the station.     Comin\' down to the station, right?   Uh, yup.   See? She\'s comin\' down to the station.   Yeah! \'Cause I remember you, Lana Kane.   You\'re still on probation for the gun charge and the stalking.     It was a hamentashen!   Yeah.   Well, you\'re not gonna "yummy Jewish cookies" your way out of this one.   Ah! I couldn\'t have murdered Ellis.   I was in Veronica\'s dressing room ripping Archer like a rented mule!  (LAUGHS) Oh, man, you never rent a mule.     So wait a second   You lease that surly bastard.     Shut up! So wait   Shut up!  So, your alibi is that you were busy committing felony assault.     Yes!   She\'s a real menace.   Shut up, and they all saw me.     I didn\'t.    What?  Yes, you did! I was right there!    Nope.    You little    Shapiro! You saw me!   Did I?    What?   Because what I don\'t see  is how that helps my client, Veronica Deane.     (GASPS)   Huge fan.    So great.     Archer   Yes, Lana?  Would you care to tell the detectives  that I couldn\'t have killed Ellis  because I was busy beating your ass?    I would love to.    (DEEP SIGH)    There.  See?   Unfortunately  Goddamn it!  I must have gotten a bonk on the noggin,    because I can\'t remember anything!   Ohahhh!  So, Miss Kane, you can ride with me  I\'ll call a van for the rest of you.   And remain with you in a supervisory capacity.     Because.  Whatever you do   You are not to wash your hands!  Uhmm   Yeah, so listen.  The whole thing about  not washing our hands  But, darling, they were so terribly goopy from our love making!  Which was so wonderful, darling.   Wasn\'t it just so wonderful.   Well, yeah.  I mean, it almost always is,  both wonderful and goopy, but  But, darling, surely you don\'t think that I could have murdered Ellis?    No! I mean you know   After all, he was killed at 2:14,  and I was in here with you, until almost the very stroke of 3:00.   Which you were extremely clear about.   And repeatedly, come to think of it.     But there\'s no clock in here, so   What do you think  about Mexico?  Like, their extradition treaty, or  No, you goose.  As a romantic getaway!  Oh.  Well, then, theoretically, me gusto mucho.   But  I have a fabulous bungalow in Las Caletas.     Just down the beach from John Huston.    Really?  Hmm.  You could hit his house with a coconut.   Which I\'ve always wanted to do.   We could be there in four hours.   Is But is now a great time, or even a not very bad time?  What with the whole murder investigation  Oh, Alan can handle that.   But until all the fuss dies down,  we could swim in the ocean  swim in tequila, dance naked on the beach by firelight  Prank John Huston with some coconuts  Besides, it looks like that enormous Lana Kane person is the real killer.   What? No, I I shouldn\'t have joked about that.     I\'ll tell the cops she   She certainly had a motive.   I mean, my God, the victim\'s jealous lover?  Yeah, hey, uh, you know what? My hands are pretty goopy, too.   I\'m just gonna pop out, give \'em a quick rinse, and  Well, just use the sink here, silly.     Uh, no.  I have diarrhea, so   (KNOCKING)  Miss Deane? I have kind of a fanboy request.   And you can\'t let those fans down!    See, I Oh.    Yeah.     I   I have diarrhea.     You better not wash those hands!   I won\'t!    I\'d like your word, please!   You have it!  Great police work.   Seriously? What is it with everybody washing their hands?  Exactly! I\'m not going to be the only chump  walking into that police station with unwashed hands!  (HIGH PITCHED VOICE) Oh, man!    (TOILET FLUSHING)   We gotta wash our hands?  What? No! They said, "Don\'t wash them. "  CAROL: Wait, what are we all washing?  Goddamn it, wash everything!  Geez! Make up your mind, America!  And I need to talk to you.  Now.   MALORY: All right, Grabney Coleman! What?  (SIGHS) It\'s about the murder.   Oh, Sterling, I know exactly what you\'re going to say.     You do?   And I know exactly what to do.     You do.    Sterling, it\'s me.   Of course I do, just like I knew you were headed for trouble  the minute you laid your eyes on that washed up old crone.   Oh, for She\'s like 50!  Also, maybe, a little a lot crazy.     Oh, really? An actress?   Who\'s crazy?  Nobody.  Get out of here, Krieger!    With your goddamn human breast milk.    Okay! Geez!  And it\'s not human!  I don\'t know if that\'s better or worse.   Anyway, now I\'m worried the cops might actually think Lana did it, so  Mexico.   Wait? Yeah.  That\'s what she said.   Well, it\'s obvious.  It\'s basically right next door, for God\'s sake.   As if Los Angeles needed another minus.   Come I don\'t know, mother.  Fleeing to Mexico?  It just kinda screams, "I\'m guilty. "  So, no one is technically fleeing, because no one is under arrest.   Yet.   So you\'re saying now would be the best time to go? If  If there could ever be a "best time"  to have your picture taken with a donkey painted to look like a zebra.   Hmm, pretty sure those are real zebras.     Typical.    Who\'s a zebra?  Goddamn it, Krieger.  I told you to Wait.     How did you change so fast?   Oh! Um  Don\'t engage him! You need to be on the first mode of transport to Mexico.   Don\'t even bother packing, just grab a fake passport  at the office and go  But first, wash your gunpowdery hands.   My Wait.  You don\'t think I did it?    Wh Who else?   Veronica!    Who\'s Veronica?   Jesus!   What the  Why are your frickin\' cyborgs here?  Because we\'re getting 30 bucks a day as extras! Each!    Who is?   Well, get the hell out of here.     All of you!   No! Now wait a minute.   This could actually help you!  To do what? Open an Adolf E.  Cheese?  Krieger, you have one of these god awful monstrosities    for each of us?   No!    Maybe.  Yes.    There you go! You go to Mexico,  your robo doppelganger takes the fall,  you come back after he gets the chair.     Ohh   First of all, I didn\'t do it!    I doesn\'t matter!   I feel like it does!    It\'s not always about you!   Wha And second of all,  there\'s no way one of these damn "inepticons"  could pass the fricking Turing test!  (SHOCKED GASPS)  Oh, they can totally pass the Turing test.   What is that? A thing from Star Wars?  No, it\'s a test to see if a machine\'s artificial intelligence  can convince a human that the machine is also human.   Which they totally can.  Go ahead.  Ask them anything about anything.   Ugh.  Okay, uh, let\'s see.   What is love?  (ELECTRONIC STROKE) Batubatu battery.   Wh wh wh wha  (GUNSHOTS)    (SCREAMS)   (SIGHS)    Now I have to wash my hands again.    (SHORT CIRCUIT ZAPPING)  Goddamn it, this is classic Archer!    Oh, yeah?   He knows I didn\'t kill Ellis!  But he\'s so goddamn immature, he thinks it\'s funny  to watch the mother of his child hauled off to jail.   Which, by the way, is a total waste of time,  because you are not gonna find any gunshot residue    on my hands.    Uh, you never know.   No, actually, I do know, because I\'m sorry    And that means what?   What?    You never know   Uh, figure of speech?  Oh, really? Because from where I\'m sitting,  which by the way is in a black woman\'s skin,  in the back of a prowler with no door handles  driven by a white cop, it sounds like the LAPD  is gonna frame me for murder.   Like I said, "You never know!"  Oh, damn it!  No o o!  You maniac! You blew him up!  Aw, damn you! Goddamn you all to hell!  Oh, give it a rest.   That\'ll do, Milkly, that\'ll do.  (SOBBING)    And here.  Hold this.    Wait.  What? No.     I don\'t want to   Hold it! Hold it right there!  Man down! Man down! Man down!  Man? It\'s basically an appliance.     (SHOCKED SIGH)   What the hell happened here?    What\'s happening?   Don\'t y\'all know?  That is what I\'m trying to find Damn it, woman!  I thought I told you not to wash your hands!  Yeah, I\'m almost positive you did.   Okay.  Nobody move.  Nobody do anything.   In fact, everybody put your hands in your damn pockets!    All right, you heard the man.    (SIGHS)    Let\'s go.    Whatever.    Okay, okay.     Ugh.    (PHONE RINGING)  Hey.  Yeah, I need you to come back to the studio real quick.   No, the van\'s not here, but it looks like we\'ve got another homicide  Uh, just in the very brief time since you left, yes.   What are ya, shootin\' \'em yourself?  How Uh Okay.  Shut up.  I\'m almost at the station,  just wait for the van, dummy.   Well, sweetheart, today just might be your lucky day.   What? You\'re gonna park in an alley, and let me go    if I give you a blow job?   Mmmm no.   They made us quit doing that.  There was a whole big thing about it.     Then why am I suddenly so lucky?   Because it looks like    maybe the killer struck again.    Ha!  Told you! Dumbass idiot cops!  So, how\'s it feel to be such an idiot?  Mm, I guess almost like there\'s a vast number of things  that can happen to you between now and when you\'re released  from police custody, and almost none of them are good?  Um.  Point.  Taken.   Let\'s go, folks.  Nothing to see here.     What on earth is going on?   Because whatever it is, my client had  absolutely nothing to do with it!  Come on, beat it! 23 skidoo!  Hey! You need to get your old, tiny, fake policeman ass  out of my space! I\'m trying to do real policeman shit!  Then arrest her! For murder!  You can\'t murder a machine!  Yeah, that\'s like the first law of robotics.   No, it\'s the exact opposite of that!  Well, excuse me, Dr.  Han Fastolfe.     Too obscure?   I mean  The point is, legally speaking,  a murder victim has to be a human being.     That is true.    Besides, it\'s your word against mine.   No, it isn\'t! Because all my K bots  have a digital recorder in their CPU.   You can\'t record me without my permission!  That is also true.  California is a two party consent state, so  Actually, in California, you can record a conversation  without the other party\'s consent, if you believe    it will collect evidence of a crime.    Aha!  But you didn\'t know a crime was going to occur  when you started recording!  Aha! But also, isn\'t the question moot?  Because that dude\'s CPU\'s totally dickholed.   Aha! But his CPU is working perfectly!    And he witnessed everything! Copley?   Yep, yep, yep!  Please rewind to Milkly\'s heinous murder and play it back for us.     All righty   None of this is admissible!  And more importantly, they\'re robots.   Accessing digit al    Ba Ba Ba Batter r ry l l l low.    (PEOPLE SCREAMING)    (GUNSHOT)   (SCREAMING)    Goddamn it!   No ho!  (SIREN BLARING)  Aw, thank God.  Okay.  Gunshot residue testing and the truth  shall set you free!  Or not.  But get in that van!    With the exception of my client!   Of course.   (LAUGHS) Absolutely.  And thank you for the autograph.   That was so great, and you\'re just so great!  And this is all a huge waste of time.   (CHUCKLES) Well, yes! Because it\'s so totally obvious  that Lana Kane murdered Ellis.   Uh, hang on.  Actually  As a matter of fact, Mr.  Shapiro will be  presenting you evidence of Miss Kane\'s guilt tomorrow morning.     He what?   Do what?   I what?    Isn\'t that what you told me?   Uh, yes?  So, Detective.  See you at elevenish?  Oh, yes.  (LAUGHING) Yes.   So great.  The rest of you, asses in the van!    You\'d better do something.    Let\'s go! Come on!    Get in there!   But, Veronica, what about Mexico?  We may not need to go, after all.   But the coconuts.  The naked tequila.     Can\'t we at least talk about it?   All right, darling.  Calm down.   Come to my house tonight, and we\'ll talk.   Yo! Faceman! In the van! Now!  Okay.  There\'s a nice way to do that.   See ya tonight.     (SIGHS) Okay, is everybody in?   (EVERYBODY) Yes!  Okay, count off!  (IN UNISON) One  Goddamn it.  Would you go?  But, Veronica, what evidence?    Well, my darling Alan   (VAN STARTING)  I have a teensy tiny favor to ask of you.   PAM:  Uh, 99 bottles of beer on the Ow!   Je sus!  MALORY: Thank you.   (GILLETTE) My pleasure.   Whoa oa oa!  DIETRICH: Keep it down back there!  I swear, if I have to pull this van over  (GROANING)  Whoa, that kinda hurt.  (BONES CRACKING)  Is L. A.  making me soft?  Or softly awesome.   Like a haiku  (SIGHS)  Oh    (SERVOS SQUEAKING)   Ho ly shit.   (LAUGHING) Right? Come here.  What are we doing?  (IDENTICAL LAUGHING) Are we doing this?  We\'re hugging it out!  Hey.  Are you up for a dangerous mission?  Am I? There is literally no question I ever wanted to hear    more than that!   Okay, cool.     Have you ever had bourbon?   (LAUGHING UNCONTROLLABLY)  Have I Ha! I wish to amend  my previous statement.   Okay, come on.  I\'ll brief you while we get ready.   Nghung.  Wait.   Hang on a sec.     (FARTS)   Oh!  (CYRILBOT) Damn it, Archer!  Me and you is this not the best?  It\'s got spinoff written all over it.   Gillette! Residue test.  Let\'s go.     (SIGHS)   Excuse me.   Do you have any idea how long this is going to take?  Yes.   At this rate, we\'ll be here all night.   Or forever, once Veronica Deane fakes her whatever bullshit evidence on me.   Thanks to you and Archer, who lied to the cops with her.     Hope you\'re happy!   Uh, duh Free cornrows.     Lana, Sterling feels awful about that.    Phht!  Which is why he\'s out there right now,  working on a plan to trap Veronica Deane  so there\'s no need to worry.   ARCHER: Are you sure?  Yes! Trust me, it\'s a good plan.   It just kind of seems a little more complicated than it needs to be.   No, it isn\'t.  Shut up.  It\'ll work.   Hmm.  Also, why are we wearing tuxedos?  Exactly.  Okay.  Let\'s do this! (SNICKERS)  Oh, man.  We\'re just like the Wonder Twins, right?  I would take the form of, uh, an eagle.  What about you?  I guess I don\'t know.  Ice stairs?  Eh, Luigi! Piccolo aiuto, eh?  (MOTOR WHINES)  WOMAN: Do you like it around the rim?  (CHUCKLES) I be I beg your pardon?  Your margarita.  Salt around the rim?  Oh.  Sorry.  Yes.  More than you know.   Although, I have to say  I prefer my margaritas on the beach in Mexico.   Mm, yes, of course! And we\'ll dance naked on the beach in Mexico  after Oh, my!  Is that a gun in your pocket, or are you just glad to see me?  Oh! Uh, both.  Sorry.   I\'ll just lay this right here, on this table.   You were saying Mexico? After  Well, after they formally charge Lana Kane with Ellis\'s murder.     And you think they will.    Oh, I should think so.   Once they find her enormous fingerprints on the gun.     And you think they will?   I Archer, do you love me?  Oh, darling.  Don\'t you know I do?  Well, then in that case,  let\'s just say I have my ways.   Oh, sorry, Lana.  You big sexy galoot.   Shapiro, that little rat.   Oh, it\'s not Alan\'s fault, darling.   He\'s doing it because he loves me.   And you live for that, don\'t you?  Making men fall in love with you?  Well, that\'s not a crime.  Is it?  No.  But murder is.  And I know you murdered Ellis Crane,  and you\'re going down for it!    (GUN COCKS)   (SIGHS)  I mean, really, darling.   Just how stupid do you think I am?  Hm.  I guess slightly more than    (GUNSHOTS)   (GROANS)  Oh!    Archer!   (SPLASH)  (SOBS, WHIMPERS)  Good night, sweet prince.   "And flights of angels sing thee to thy rest. "    Jesus Christ!   (GASPS)  So, you\'re actually kind of nuts, huh?  But But how?  Cyborg.  I won\'t bore you with all the details,  and science, which actually I don\'t even understand, so  So, all this time, you knew that I killed Ellis.   Well, I suspected.  All that "stroke of three" stuff?  Then you were trying so hard to make Lana look guilty?  Helped by Marlon Jerkins over here, just because  I was mad at her I mean, Jesus!    I\'m such an idiot.    Oh, I wouldn\'t say that, darling.   You caught me, didn\'t you?    Well, yeah, but   You knew that I was secretly having  all these shoots sabotaged,  because Sandpiper Crane was insuring the productions  for ten times what they could ever make at the box office!    Yes.    Well, bravo, Archer.  Bravo.   Well, wait! So Longwater was all just a grubby little insurance scam?  Little? It was a massive insurance scam,  and also a re insurance scam,  not to mention a stock manipulation scam  with a little help from those odious twits at Stratton Whitney!  Wait, what?  Their hedge fund shorted the insurance company\'s stock.     We made millions!   (GUFFAWS) I mean, Jesus!  And all this time, I thought it was just a sex tape!  Oh.  That actually was a sex tape,  which I accidentally recorded onto a disk  with some Longwater evidence.   Oh, well, that\'s just stupid.   As are you, Veronica, you just confessed.   Yes, darling, but only to you.   Doesn\'t do you a bit of good without a witness.     Uh, dahoy?   What, the robot?  No, not a robot! Again, I don\'t understand all the science, but  (LAUGHING) Robots can\'t testify in court.   Oh, I know that.  But wait.  Hang on  Plus, it didn\'t hear what I said, because spoiler alert    it\'s dead!   Wait, but Goddamn it!  So, no, Archer.  I didn\'t confess.   Not to a crime, anyway.  But I\'m afraid I do have to confess  that ohh  I really could have fallen for you.     Really?   My God, yes.     But unfortunately   (GUNSHOT)   (GROANS)  (GASPING)    Goddamn it.    (GUN CLICKS)    Goddamn it!   (GUN CLATTERS)  Veronica! (GRUNTS) Veronica!    (CLATTERING)   Ow.  Wha  (COUGHS) Who puts a table there?  (FOOTSTEPS)  Archer? Archer.     Archer!   That would be Ms.  Archer to you.   Oh! I\'ll make a note.   You\'re free to go.  Actually, you\'re all free to go.     Really?   (ALL CHATTERING)  But I haven\'t even been tested yet.   You don\'t need to get tested, they have a suspect.     Veronica Deane.    Ha!    (SURPRISED CHATTER)   Geezy Petes!  This whole time, I thought Ellis Crane was the one behind all this.   Yeah, right up until he shot himself through both the wrist and the face.   Anymahoo, apparently she shot another guy.   Floating in her pool as we speak.   (GASPS) Sterling!  (CHATTER ON POLICE RADIO)  HARRIS: Well, what do you think?  DIETRICH: I think that in my next life, I\'m gonna come back as a movie star.   Yeah.  Look out, gay porn.     Rimshot.    Yeah, that could be your name.   So what, some movie star lives here?  Yes.  Veronica Deane.  Don\'t you remember?  She\'s a person of interest in the other murder we\'re working.     No shit.    Wait, what are you  You were just questioning her ten hours ago!  He was her alibi.     You like her?   As an actress, or for this homicide?    Both.    Loved her in Shanghai Moon.     Oh, my God, that dress?   Right?  But as for Tennessee Tuxedo here, I want to talk to her.   See if she knows who tried to weight him down  with an ounce of lead.  Found it on the ground, over there by the table.     Is it hers?   Hard to tell with no serial number.   Yeah, probably why they put them on there.   Rimshot.   Hey, you should ask Veronica Deane if her agent reps gay porn stars.   And maybe if she murdered this guy.     Ah, you got a real knack for this.    Rim Schott.   Yeah, you don\'t have to say it every time.   No, as my gay porn name.  Not bad.     Let me through!   Whoa, whoa, whoa!    Hey, this is a crime scene!   Hang on, hang on!  Sterling! (GASPS)  (ALL SHRIEKING)  (SOBBING)    Thanks.  Thanks, assholes!   Yeah.  Yeah, right?    (GASPS)   Archer?  (SHOCKED CHATTERING)  Bet she hasn\'t cried like that since Prohibition.     You little   Ow!    Ow! Cut it   Had me worried sick!  Mother! Ow! Stop it.  I am gut shot, woman!  By Veronica Deane, by the way,  and I will be more than happy to testify to that.   Damn! (SIGHS)  Any idea where she is?  Probably Mexico.  Go to John Huston\'s house,    and start throwing coconuts.    Which I\'ve always wanted to do.   But What? Okay, wait.  How are there two of you?  They\'ve got robots.  It\'s cool.  We\'ve already been through all this.  So    Okay, A: They\'re not robots.    Nobody cares.   And B: they\'re obviously good enough to pass the Turing test.     Oh, totally.    Whatever that is.   Okay, you\'re all free to go!    Including you, Miss Kane.    With our sincere apologies.   Yeah Not accepted.  But  Speaking of Archer,  is there anything you\'d like to say to me?  (SIGHS) Yes, Lana.  There is.   (GASPING, EXCLAMATIONS)  What\'s happening? What are we doing?  Lana Kane  (CYBORG CRASHING)  No o o!  (HYSTERICAL TEARS AND SCREAMING)  Wait, what just happened?  Holy shitsnacks!  Wait.  But if that\'s a cyborg  That means the man in the pool is  MALORY: Ster ling!  (SOBBING)  Wow! Suck it, Alan Turing!1 [slow jazz]  [Man] Oh death, where is thy sting?  Oh grave, where is thy victory?  For man that is born of woman hath but a short time to live,  and is full of misery.   He cometh up and is cut down like a flower.   He fleeth as it were a shadow.   In the midst of life, we are in death.   In the midst of death, we are in life.   [Lana] It was a nice service.  [Malory] Hmm.   And he had a good, long life.   He did, for a heroin addict.   Sad Archer wasn\'t there.   Or here.   It\'s been a long couple of months.   Three, next week.   You should go sleep in a real bed.   I\'m fine.  I want to be here if    When he wakes up.   Yeah.  Did the doctor    The same.   Could be tomorrow,  could be another three months.   Could be Yeah.   Well, I guess I\'ll go.   I\'ll try to bring A. J.  by tomorrow.   Or Friday.  We\'ll be here.   At least he doesn\'t know Woodhouse died.   That would break his heart.  Mm hmm.   Although there\'s no telling what he knows.   Or what he\'s thinking about.   Well, dreaming about, I suppose.   No.   No, no, no!  No! [grunting]  No!  Noooo!  [jazzy theme]   Let me go, God damn it! Come on!  Go easy, Archer.  Poovey, I swear to Christ,  I will punch you right in the genitals.   It\'s okay.  Let him go.  You big lummox.   Oh, Jesus.  Woodhouse.   So, where are you, Figgis? You got any leads? What do you think happened?  I think he got too far behind on his dope tab,  so sometime last night his dealer punched his ticket for him.   Yeah, and wouldn\'t that be convenient?  [chuckles] Not for him.   You little rat fu   [whistling]  Oh! Now, scram, Archer.   Ow.  Son of a   I mean, just ow.   You can claim the body at the morgue.   But that better be the last time I smell you anywhere near this case.   Yeah, we\'ll see about that.   Yeah? And we\'ll see how you like it when I yank your P. I.  license.   [sighs] See you around, Poovey.   Take it easy, Archer.   Oh, hey, and Archer?  Come to think of it, where were you last night?  Ask your wife.  [growls]  Ah, you know his wife left him.   For you, Archer, \'cause you screwed her tits off at the precinct cookout.   So then she thought the two of you would get married  and live happily ever after, but then you were like, "What?"  Exactly.  That face right there.   I   [groans]  How does that help?  Mm, humanizes you?  [whistling]  Hey, pal.  You got a second?  I do not, actually,  and I am not, come to think of it, so screw.   Hm.  I\'m sorry.  Let me rephrase that.  Wh    Do you know who I work for?  Do you know how much I don\'t care?  About what? Living out the week?  \'Cause we\'re both out of luck, friend.   I left all my cash at the track.   But if maybe you wanted some dope    Do I look like a junkie to you?  I don\'t know.  I try not to judge.   You used to sell to this guy.   Yeah, Woodhouse.  He    Wait.  Used to?  He\'s dead.  What?  Oh, for the love of    He was one of   No, he was my best customer.   So, he was paid up?  Paid up? He paid in advance.   Yeah.  He was not great with money.   [chuckling] Right? I mean, who tips their dope dealer?  So, I guess we\'re done here?  We\'re done when I say we\'re done.   I\'m sorry.   Let me rephrase that.  [growling]  [sighs]  [snarls] Okay.   So, one of two things is gonna happen here.   Oh! [clatter]  Hm.  Wonder what the other thing was.   [jazz trumpet]  Goddamn.   Is it your feeding time already? [growls]  I wish you wouldn\'t antagonize him.   Well, I wish you could hold a tempo.   [rimshot]  Which, clearly, sarcastic.   No, it wasn\'t.   [snores] No, thank you, Zerk, that will suffice.   [Zerk growls] Huh?  Wha   What\'s   What    Ah, there he is.   The infamous Sterling Archer, private eye.   And I trust you know who I am?  I do.  But what do I call you?  Mother will do.   And so, you do know who I am, but you don\'t care?  What? No, I    That\'s what you told my bartender  when you stuck a gun in his ribs.   I   Well, first of all,  your bartender sells heroin.   Gasp.  And I pulled my gun  because I\'m trying to find out who killed my partner.   That would be Woodhouse.   Yeah.  He   How\'d you know that?  It\'s my business to know a great many things, Mr.  Archer.   What would you say if I offered you a drink?  I\'d probably say bourbon.   Old Buncombe, if you\'ve got it.   Oh, I have a bit of everything.   So I hear.  Hmm.   How do you take it? Usually alone.   Thank you for making an exception.   Please.   And so, I do hope you\'ll forgive Mr.  Zerk  for his hands on approach.  Maybe.   But I sure won\'t forget it.   Yes.  I believe that was the point.   I meant   I know what you meant.   Cigarette? No, thanks.   Never took it up.  Really?  But I thought they loaded all you G. I. s down  with cartons of them on your way up the gangplank.   They did.  Supposed to help keep you alert.   I guess I found it all stimulating enough.   Hm.  Normandy? Yeah.   Omaha Beach.   By way of North Africa and Sicily.   And after Normandy, through France and Belgium,  all the way to Berlin.   Well, I had to get to Berlin.   I\'d sent all my clean shirts ahead.   Mm hmm.  Speak any German?  You know.  "Don\'t shoot," "I surrender,"  "Hitler\'s the tops," stuff like that.  Mm hmm.   Bronze Star with two Oak Leaves and "V" device.   Legion of Merit.  Croix de Guerre with Palm.   Silver Star with two Oak Leaves.   Distinguished Service Cross with one Oak Leaf and "V" device.   Three Purple Hearts.  It goes on, Mr.  Archer.   Yeah, senior year, I was voted class flirt.   And yet, you turned down a battlefield commission to second lieutenant.   Well, after class flirt, I mean    In fact, you left the army at the same rank you went in.   Buck private.  And do you know what that tells me?  I need a new lock on my diary?  That you don\'t like taking orders.   Yeah, or having my time wasted.   So, if you\'ll excuse me    Oh, no.  I will not.   Excuse me? No.   I just said.  Sorry?  Me too.  I   Wait.  No.  I meant    I know what you meant.   I   Look, I\'m just trying to find the bastard  who killed my partner.  With which, perhaps, I can help you.   With which   Hang on.  Wait, really?  Perhaps.  But before I could help you,  I would need you to help me.   I\'ll do anything to find Woodhouse\'s killer.   And then avenge his death.   Well then, Mr.  Archer,  what would you say if I offered you a job?  I\'d probably say yes.   And also bourbon.   [Mother] Len Trexler.   I assume you\'re familiar with him?  [Archer, chuckling] Who isn\'t?  He\'s the biggest mobster in L. A.   Well, maybe not for much longer.   Why, is he sick?  Wh   No, you ass.   Although you could say that his time has come.   Wait.  You want me to help you make a move against Len Trexler?  Whose hobby is dissolving people in acid?  Oh, now, Trexler doesn\'t do the actual dissolving.   That would be his enforcer, Dutch Dylan.   I don\'t care who does the dissolving.   But if you help me, I can help you.   Perhaps.  You made that very clear.   Look, all I need you to do is go down to Pier 9 in Long Beach tonight  and simply observe and report back.   No.  Oh, come on.   I thought you had guts.   And I\'d like to keep them in their current location,  i. e. , inside me, not melting in a 50 gallon drum of acid  with my shoes and feet and face.   Never know how much I love you   Never know how much I care   When you put your arms around me   I get a fever that\'s so hard to bear   You give me fever   When you kiss me   Fever when you hold me tight   Fever in the morning   Fever all through the night   You give me fever   I\'m in.  Excellent.   Then find killer, uh, revenge do.   Careful what you wish for.   You just might get it.   Till you sizzle   What a lovely way   To burn   That\'s some set you got on you.   I mean, not your   I    I meant   I know what you meant.   Uh, yeah.  Uh, let me start over.   My name\'s Archer.   Lana Kane.   And, I\'m sorry, but have we met?  If we had, you\'d remember.   [rimshot] [Gillette] Stop it.   And so, um, you\'re the singer here.   Wow.  And you must be an old gypsy woman.   Close.  I\'m a private investigator.   I\'m doing some work for your boss.   And apparently doing it with a fresh new take  on the word "private. "  Can I buy you a drink?  Hmm.  Bottle of PBR.   [chuckling] PBR.  Wow.  I I would have thought your tastes  were a little more, um    Pierre Beauvais.  Rouge.   Ah.  Problem?  No.  Not when you\'re pulling down 25 bucks a day plus expenses.   And what sort of daily expenses  does a semi private investigator incur?  Bullets? Daily.   Or, I don\'t know, maybe a surf and turf dinner  at the Polo Lounge? Un hun.   And then maybe a room upstairs, at the Beverly Hills Hotel.   Uh huh.  And then, maybe    I\'m gonna leave you here.   Between hope and despair.   What the hell does that mean?  Before you shoot a big, salty load in your pants.   Shut up.  How much for the champagne?  Twenty six dollars.   Wha   I\'m not paying 26 bucks  for a bottle of frustration.  [growls]  [groans] You\'re lucky my ear hurts.   There.  Plus tip.   How about the tip of my cock? [rimshot]  [Gillette] Stop it! So, in that scenario,  would I take your penis in my hand? My mouth?  Asshole.  Wait, no.  I mean   Not   Goddammit.   [Archer] Pierre Beauvais Rouge.   Hardy har har.   Hey, 1933 called.   They want their gold digger back.   Meanwhile, I have to dip into my rainy day fund,  which is barely enough to buy an extremely nice umbrella.   Wait.  What the    Holy shit.   Leave it to Woodhouse.   Now I can find his killer and take revenge.   Although I better get moving if I\'m going to make it to Long Beach in time.   Okay.  So, first thing tomorrow morning.   Well, or probably after breakfast.   After which, I just remembered I\'m getting a haircut.   But after that,  vengeance will be mine.   Oh, duh.   Just like you always said, Woodhouse,  "Lock the safe, Archer, you dumb twat. "  I wanted to get mixed up with mobsters  like Mother and Len Trexler about as much as I wanted  a new hole in my head.   But I meant it when I said I\'d do anything  to find Woodhouse\'s killer.   Although, truth be told,  I\'d also do anything just to see Lana Kane again.   So here I am, headed straight into the belly of the beast.   Nothing between me and death but my wits  and the cold, blue steel of my . 45.   [chuckles] I have no idea why I\'m telling you all this.   Or why I picked you up.   I don\'t even know where you\'re going.  [whines]  Hopefully Long Beach.  [barks]  Well, too bad.   [whispering] Because I don\'t need a spirit animal,  and if I did, he\'d be an ocelot.   [whines]  Okay.  Observe and report.   So easy, even a cop could   Wait.   What the    Hm.  Now, what\'s a nice, unmarked LAPD girl like you  doing in a place like this? [engine approaches]  So, what\'s Trexler importing?  Some new, improved people melting acid?  Dammit, they\'re in defilade, I can\'t see what they\'re doing.   [sighs] I gotta get higher.   That ought to do.   [sniffs]  Now, that is a lovely parting gift.   And who\'s our lucky contestant, Bob?  Come on, you bent prick, look up.   Dammit.   [Man] Come on, move it.   [Archer] Huh.  Let\'s go, let\'s go.  Come on.   Guess Trexler\'s not opening a Chinese restaurant.   I mean, in this economy?  A whorehouse, though, bet that\'s pretty much recession proof.   Move, goddammit.  [cries out]  [Archer gasps]  [panting]  Okay, Archer, just stay calm.   Yeah, good advice.   Ow.  Oh.  Still tender, huh?  What the hell are you doing here?  Asking you the same thing.   None of your damn business.   Everything is my business.   Oh.  Including white slavery? Yes, incl   Wait.  What?  Those girls are tied up, asshole.   No, they\'re not, they\'re just    Ah, dog dicks.   Yeah, so   But wouldn\'t it be yellow slavery?  [scoffs] Wh   I don\'t know, racist.   White slavery\'s just as racist.  What?  No.  You know, if you differentiate between, like, cotton picking slavery    Jesus Christ.  and then white slavery, that\'s    Sexual slavery, then.  Okay.   Goddammit.  [engine starts]  My point is I think we\'re both anti slavery.   Yeah, you\'re a regular Granville Sharp.   But since I\'m guessing that was your boss taking the payoff    But he didn\'t know about this part.   Or any part, \'cause he wasn\'t here.   Wow.  Well, I\'m sold.   Really? No, dickhead.   And neither are they.  Whoa.   Look, I don\'t know what the hell you think you\'re gonna do.   Well then, that makes two of us.  What are you    Oof.   Well?  Goddammit.   Son of a bitch!  [grunts]  [sighs] I mean  So, funny story.   Jesus, it\'s the cop, Poovey.   So, yeah.  So    [screaming]  [grunting]  [panting]  [sniffs] Okay.   One of two things is gonna   [gunshots]  Wh What    What? the shit?  They knew me from work.   Ugh.  What? You think they heard that?  Because, just so I understand you,  your theory is the truck backfired,  whereas your theory is fireworks.   They are Chinese.   What in Christ Foo Yung  could they possibly be celebrating?  Who knows? They got their own calendar.   [sighs] Go back there,  you team of oxen, and   [door opens]  Can I help you?  Out of the truck.  [chuckles]  Do you know whose truck this is?  Do you know how much I don\'t care?  That\'s cute.  No, seriously.   You\'re making a   [grunts]  huge mistake.  Huge!  Do you hear me? Yes.  We\'re right here.   Well, you better just kill me.   That\'s   [clears throat, deeper] That\'s what I said.   Because when, not if, I find out who you are,  I\'m going to liquefy you.   Okay.  Same goes for those Chinese whores.   So I\'m serious.  You better kill me.   So, you\'re saying when I drive this truck out of here,  you\'d prefer I drove over your head, not your ankles.   Wait, what? No, no.   No, I meant   I know what you meant.   [screaming]  [crying]  What?  Nothing.   I mean, I feel like I already know the answer,  but are you crazy?  How are they my responsibility?  Because your crooked boss  took a payoff to let them off that boat.   What am I supposed to do with them?  Get them jobs.  There are plenty of Chinese restaurants, laundries    Now who\'s racist?  No.  Because those are places  where other Chinese people already work.   They don\'t speak English, dumbass.   I do little bit.  Then shut up.   [gasps] I\'m so sorry.   I can\'t even imagine the day you\'ve had.   God, the week.   The life.  [chuckling] Shut up.   Seriously.  Sorry about the laundry thing.   You\'re doing this, end of story.  I    A story in which a Los Angeles police detective  murdered three people.   [sighs] Dick.   Thank you very much! Thank you!  [sighs] Super.   Now I get to go report what I observed.   Then drove a truck over.   So, first, maybe a drink.   Or 12.   Goddammit!  Goddammit.   Goddammit!  [phone rings]  Who the hell is this?  [Mother] Guess.  [gulps]  I I was just coming to see you.   Oh, goody.   Because I am just on pins and needles   Well    to hear how you turned a stakeout into three dead, one crippled,  and Len Trexler ready to go to war.   How do you already know that?  And I swear to God, I\'ve got half a mind  to just kill you myself.  I    But the other half says you\'re slightly more use to me alive.   If   For now.   I   Because now you owe me.   My office, Archer.  First thing tomorrow morning.   [dial tone]  [sighs]  Ahem.   Mr.  Archer?  Depends.  Who\'s asking?  Charlotte Vandertunt,  heiress to the vast Vandertunt publishing fortune.   And I would like to hire you  to murder me.   Okay.1 So, what are we doing? Are we just jumping right into this, or    Not literally, you ass! You scared me half to death! Ow! Ow! Will you   Ow! Damn it!  You idiot! Ow! Stop it!  What is your   Ow! [huffs]  I would like a drink, please.   Ow.  Join this great new club.   Brandy, if you have it.  Fresh out, turns out.   Good Lord.  You should have your underbutler fire the housekeeper.   Yeah, maybe after he\'s done getting the caviar stains out of my spats.   I was being facetious, Mr.  Archer.   I   I know you\'re poor.   Well, middle class.  This cannot be the middle.   Look, Miss Vandertunt.   Heiress to the vast Vandertunt publishing fortune.   Right.  So, I\'ve had a long day.   [gulping]  [gulping continues]  My partner was murdered.  My office was burgled.   I pissed off two crime bosses and a dirty cop,  and crushed the ankles of a psychopath who,  just for kicks, melts people.   So, as much as I would genuinely like to,  I\'m afraid I don\'t have time to kill you.   You misunderstand me, Mr.  Archer.   I want you to help me fake my death.   For which I am prepared to offer you $10,000.   Oh.  And my body.   The ten grand is plenty.   I\'m afraid this is nonnegotiable.   [breathily] Do your worst.   [chuckles] I will.   [theme]   Ugh, so when I said do your worst  [chuckling] I   I know.  Sorry.  Long day.   Uh, plus my ear hurts? [gasps]  [singsongy] I have codeine!  [Archer] Because heirs to fortunes  like your family\'s don\'t fake their own deaths.   They murder their parents and blame it on some poor Hispanic or Negro.   Yes, I thought about that, but I don\'t know any Hispanics or Negroes.   No, they make up the Hispanic or Negro.   I honestly wouldn\'t know where to begin.   Okay, but   Boy, these are good.   Mmm! Aren\'t they? Zesty.   But putting aside, for now, why you\'d want to fake your own death    Because I have to get away from my family.   They\'re a seething cauldron of neurotic, alcoholic,  narcissistic, quasi incestuous megalomaniacs!  How quasi?  [sighs] I don\'t know.  A four?  Out of what? Are you going to help me or not?  I   Look, I really don\'t think you\'ve thought this thing through.   Mm.  For starters, even if you pull this off, what are you gonna do for money?  Well, I   I shall work, of course.   [chuckles] As what?  Uh, one of those.   A food perambulator.   Well, my apologies.  I thought you were heading into this half cocked.   Said the pot to the kettle.  [giggles] My ear hurt!  You\'re not some runaway kid whose family couldn\'t care less she\'s gone.   They\'re gonna be looking for you.   So, to make this work, you\'d need a body.   And not just any body.  A body your same size,  same height and weight, your same general bone structure.   A body   I mean, if you\'re gonna do what has to be done here,  a body with your exact same dental records.  [squealing]  [laughing giddily] Who is that?  I don\'t know! [laughs]  I mean, obviously she\'s a maid.  Really.   I just don\'t know her name, because   She\'s a maid?  Obviously.   Did you kill her?  Wha   No! Jesus! [scoffs]  My brother did.  [exhales]  Well, technically, I suppose the drunken abortionist did.   But my brother got her pregnant in the first place.   And my father would\'ve killed her  if she had refused to get an abortion, so  But, I mean, not really? Really.   Why do you think my father started the Spanish American War?  Wasn\'t it sugar? He got my aunt pregnant.   And sugar? I guess.  I don\'t know.  Shut up!  [sighs] The point is, this poor girl was dead  the minute her panties hit the straw.  The    In the stables.  Ah.   But want to know the best part? That wasn\'t it?  Look! What are you   Uh, no, don\'t    Not one cavity, not one filling!  Since when and how do you know that? Don\'t you see?  Her teeth are perfect.  My teeth are perfect.   Ergo, this plan is perfect!  I mean, dentally, maybe, but if she just disappears?  Think of her family.  Do you think I haven\'t?  Yes.  What?  I think you haven\'t.   [sighs] If you help me do this,  I\'ll make an anonymous payment to her family  for an additional $10,000.   Um, how does that bring them closure?  [scoffs] It comes with a note saying she\'s dead.   Look, nothing we can do will bring this poor girl back to life.   I know, but   Not even a voodoo priestess,  flown here from Haiti at great expense,  and then every year, on Grandma\'s birthday,  they throw it your face! Uh  So the best thing we can do now  is to fill this car to the rafters with dynamite  and shove it over a cliff.  [chuckles]  That is literally the worst thing we can do.   Oh, right.  [sighs]  Dynamite would blow her teeth all over the stupid beach.   Well, and   And then what\'s the point?  [crunching]  Exactly.   So we\'ll fake the crash tonight, but first we\'re gonna plant a few seeds.   [scoffs] First of all, if I wanted your seed    Seeds of deception.   Oh, sorry.  I thought you meant    I know what you meant.   What in God\'s name are you doing?  Scrooching down.  Well, stop it!  Stop that this instant! You stop    Shut up.  I don\'t want anybody in Dreamland to see me.   Well, I don\'t want anyone to see me being chauffeured by a dwarf!  Yeah.  Then we\'d have to find a dead dwarf and a tiny chauffeur uniform.   Why? To   Oh, never mind.   But she can\'t be dressed like a maid, so we need to put her in your clothes.   [gasps] Right! Then we should go to my hotel.   Which is  Nice? Where    Oh! is your hotel?  The Chesley, on Sunset.  That wasn\'t so hard, was it?  [snorting chuckle] That\'s what I said.   [guffawing] [groans]  [Dutch crying] [Trexler] Hey, hey, hey, hey.  Come on.   Where\'s my tough guy?  Huh? Where\'s my tough old Dutch?  [sniffles] There he is.   Huh? Now listen.  [sniffles]  Shut up and listen to me, okay?  Because I know   [stifled sob]  I know this isn\'t, you know, ideal,  but you gotta pull yourself together!  [sobbing] No, no.  I\'m sorry.   That was a poor choice of words,  but for Christ\'s sake, man.   There\'s two dead men walking around there  who stole from me   [crying softly]  i. e. , my whores, and from you, i. e. , your feet!  And you are gonna find them,  and you are gonna bring them to me,  and then I\'m gonna make them wish they were in hell with a case of the clap!  How can I? [sniffles]  They took my feet, Lenny.   They took my [sobbing] fee ee ee ee eet!  [sniffles] Ow.   Ow! Shut up.   [dial tone] Sorry.   I don\'t pay you to be sorry.   I pay you to make other people sorry.   Now here.  [line ringing]  Do what he tells you.   What who tells me?  The guy that\'s gonna fix you.   [man] Hello?  [speaking German]    [Archer] What? [Charlotte] Absolutely not!  Why not? I\'m not gonna stuff  that poor girl into my clothes, in the trunk of a car,  like so much forcemeat!  So much what? Forcemeat.  Such as one might find  in a quenelle, roulade, or galantine.   [scoffs] Well, now you\'re just being obtuse.   I\'m being obtuse? Yes.   As opposed to you, who wants to parade a corpse through a hotel lobby  just so you can dress her in your room?  Well, I\'d hardly call this a parade.   [man] Oh, good morning, Miss Vandertunt.  [gasps]  Can I help you?  No.  We\'re fine.  No, thank you.   My maid, whose name is, um  Bernice? Somewhat obviously.   Bernice! Yes, Bernice.   And she was dead drunk in a nearby saloon.   Poor thing.  [chuckles]  The curse of the Irish, and so forth.   Ah, jeez.  Well, let\'s get her inside.   No! Oh, no.  Thank you.  Thank you.   No.  We\'ll use this one.  No, no, no.   That   That one\'s good.  Let\'s   No, this one!  No! We are not going through  a revolving door with Bernice.   But it wastes so much less air conditioning than a regular door.   The regular door is wide ass open!  Oh, right.  Well, then, what\'s the point?  Exactly.   [bell dings] Honestly,  I don\'t know why you\'re so angry.   Which I think is why I\'m so angry.  [bell dings]  And I can see why you would be.  [Trexler] Oh, yeah?  I mean, you don\'t think I\'m being unreasonable?  No! I mean, no   I mean    Because not only did I pay a lot of money  for those magical disappearing whores,  I also paid you a lot of money.   Well, yes, but that was    I mean, that was more to look the other way, so    Figuratively!  Not literally,  while those assholes were taking my load!  [snickering]  [clears throat]  Do you have a cat? I smell dander.   Now, you listen to me, Figgis, you schnorrer.  You\'re gonna find my whores,  and you are gonna find the bastards who took my whores,  and crippled my right hand man, or    Or   I\'m just spit balling here    what if I just gave you back the money?  Because I do not want the money!  That is why I exchanged the money for goods and/or services,  which is the core concept of economics.   Isn\'t it sugar?  Or, like, scarcity of sugar?  You got one week, Figgis.  Or else.   Wow.  Goosebumps.   A week? How in the risen Christ am I supposed to find them in a week?  I don\'t even know where to think about thinking to start looking!  [chattering in Chinese] Okay, okay! Okay!  Okay! Goddamn it! [chattering stops]  Okay.  I gotta go to work, but I\'ll be back tonight.   And when I get back, I wouldn\'t mind if the place smelled  like Lemon Pledge and orange chicken.   Mm, maybe Chinatown?  Oh, yeah.    Hey, and while we\'re at it, why not regular China?  Or maybe Sarcastic Island, off the coast of That Was Uncalled For.   Will you shut up? Gladly.   And then ask yourself cui bono?  [Archer] What? I said, "Why was your office ransacked?"  Because somebody killed my partner, and he left an envelope full of clues in the safe.   Why on earth would he do that? What? No, not the killer, my    And what on earth are you doing?  Trying to offset some of the blue.   She looks like a   a rodeo clown.   You\'ve clearly never been to a rodeo.   Must you rob this poor girl of her very last shred of dignity?  You did that! You did that when you stuffed her  in the trunk of your Rolls Royce, you spoiled little    [muffled grunting]  Wait.  Really? Mm!  [breathily] Ohh Okay.   [muffled grunting]  [zipper unzips]  Oh! Cover her face.   [chuckling, muttering] What?  [quietly] I don\'t want her watching us.   [chuckles] Oh.  Okay.   [Charlotte] So  why did someone murder your partner?  That\'s what I\'m trying to find out.   Really? I would think who is much more important than why.   I   Because if you found out who killed him,  you could make them tell you why.   Wow, you\'re a regular Monsieur    And last night,  whoever, or whoevers, broke into your office  presumably knew you\'d be elsewhere.   I   Huh? So, who knew you wouldn\'t be there?  Well, I mean, it was late at night.  There was no reason  for anybody to think I would be at the office, so  [Poovey] Ya lost me.   [Figgis] "Cui bono," you dummy.   It\'s Latin.  It means "to whose profit. " So?  So, who knew you wouldn\'t be there?  So, you big ox, when Trexler loses  who gains?  [Charlotte] Oh, come now.  Don\'t be such a pout.   I think getting Bernice through the lobby  went about as well as could reasonably be expected.   [clattering] [barking]  [groaning]  [clears throat] Sorry.   Besides, if   If you don\'t shut your fat mouth,  it\'s gonna be you going over that goddamn cliff instead of Bernice!  Please! Then you\'d never get paid.   [brakes screech]  It would be worth it.   What\'s this? Why have we stopped?  To get some answers.  I won\'t be long.  Stay here.   I shall do nothing of the sort.   [sighs] Of course you shalln\'t.   Why, the very idea, sitting in a car in the street like some sort of    Dirty cop.  Well, or any tradesman, really.   Oh! I need you to stop talking.   And when we get in there, I need you to continue  to stop talking to anybody.   You\'re hurting me! [whimpers]  And it\'s the highlight of my day.   [exclaims in German]  [speaking German]  [Archer] Do what? What?  What? What do you want?  Couple minutes with Mother.  [scoffs] Knock yourself out.   Well, I\'m sorry I can\'t be of more help to you, Lieutenant, but    "Can\'t" and "won\'t" are two very different things, Mother.   And yet the end result is still the same.   Why, Mr.  Archer.   Mother.  Archer.   Figgis.  Archer.   Poovey.  You look like shit.   [sighs] Couldn\'t sleep.   Noisy house guests.  What do you mean, "house guests"?  [chuckles] Wouldn\'t they be cave guests? [rimshot]  [man] Stop it! What are you doing here, anyway?  I heard they did a nice wedge salad.   Ooh.  We don\'t.   Aww.  And now that we\'ve settled that,  if you two will please excuse us?  Okay, Mother, but remember what I told you.   Remember what I told you.   [snickers, sniffs]  It is just Dandertown Frolics.   Move, dick!  Slang for "detective," so not an insult!  What is insulting is that you\'ve kept me waiting for ten hours.   I   Sorry.  I\'ve had a busy day.   I\'ll bet.  I\'ve had quite a busy day myself  trying to shut down rumors I had anything to do with that bloodbath down in Long Beach.   I wouldn\'t say "bloodbath. "  Although, now that I come to think of it,  the easiest thing would be to just tell Len Trexler it was you.   That would be pretty easy.   But I have another job for you.     Great.    Come back at midnight.  I\'ll give you the details.   And don\'t be late again.  Um, okay.   Anything else? Well, uh,  it\'s just that while I was down in Long Beach,  somebody broke into my office and tossed the place.   And? And, well, I mean, it\'s just,  not many people knew I wouldn\'t be there.   In your office, late at night.   Yes.  And?  And I will see you at midnight.   No, it\'s just, what\'s a society dame like you  doing in a place like this?  Leaving it.  Let\'s go.   Wha   Rude! Bernice is waiting.   Oh, right.   [gasps] Miss Kane!  Archer.   Wow.  Fancy meeting you here, huh?  At my job? Yeah.  I mean, what are the odds?  One to one? Yeah.  I don\'t know.  Maybe.   So, um  Yeah.  So, uh, okay.   See   See ya around, or    [gasps] Oh, my God! You have a crush on her!  What? No I don\'t.  I    Yes, you do! That was the cutest thing!  And I think she has a crush on you.   No, she   Wait.  Really? Absolutely!  Why   Why   Why do you think that? Did she    Just admit that you like her.   Well, yeah.  I mean, of course I   Hey! Yeah.   Me and him? We just fucked!  What is wrong with you?  Well, for one thing, I may be literally starving to death.   [gasps] Clams! What?  Oh, we should stop for fried clams  at one of those darling little shacks.   [Archer] We\'re not stopping for fried clams.   There is a dead woman in the trunk!  Well, obviously, I meant after.   Also, I think we\'re being followed.   What? We\'re not being followed.   There aren\'t any headlights back there.   I think their headlights are off.  No, they\'re not,  because it\'s pitch dark, and we\'re not being followed!  I think we\'re being followed.  We\'re not being followed!  And also, how have you not been murdered?  I think we\'re being f   [brakes screech]  We are not being followed!  I am a trained private investigator!  If we were being followed, I would know it!  Fine.  Then drive.  Actually, we\'re here.   Sorry, Bernice.  Won\'t be long.   Okay.  So, I\'m gonna soak the upholstery with gas, set a 20 second cordite fuse,  then we\'ll put Bernice in the driver\'s seat, jam a rock on the accelerator,  light the fuse, and then slam it   [grunts]  [Charlotte screams] [brakes screech]  Archer!  [groaning] [shushing]  [groaning continues] Shh!  [speaking French]  Wha   [mutters]  [woman screaming] [man yelling]  Sorry! Our headlights don\'t work! [bullet zings]  [tires screeching]  [blows]  [cackles]  [laughing maniacally]  So, you\'re just straight up crazy.   [blows raspberry] Ow.  [groans]  Well? Are we doing this, or what?  Because if I don\'t get some clams soon, I won\'t be responsible for my actions.   What? I told you we were being followed.   [grunts] That was just a car with broken headlights.   It was a coincidence.  [grunts]  Because we weren\'t being followed!  [sighs]  Goddamn it.   Hello!1 So, uh, what are we doing? Are we just jumping right into this, or    How are you assholes even here?  [sighs] We followed you.   Duh.  Hmm!  Looks like she\'s having a rough night.   Her? What about me? Will you shut up?  Will you stop illustrating my point?  So, is this the part where you tell me it\'s not what it looks like?  I don\'t know.  What does it look like? You tell me.   It\'s not what it looks like? Which is  Murder, Figgis, you insufferable little prick!  It looks like murder! Yeah, I guess it does, kind of.   But it shows what you know, because it\'s only accessory after the fact.   [scoffs] We were merely using this poor  pre deceased young woman to fake my death.  What?  Why? She\'s trying to get out  of a quasi incestuous home life situation.   How quasi?  [sighs] Like, a four?  Eh.  Put a ham in it, Poovey.   What\'s your story, lady? Who are you?  Charlotte Vandertunt?  Heiress to the vast Vandertunt publishing fortune?  Really? Schmancy.   Well, then, seeing as how that\'s the case, are the keys in the Rolls?  Yeah.  They\'re   Wait.  Why?  Because I\'m going to drive it,  and Sergeant Poovey is going to drive you in my car.   To jail.  Because you\'re both under arrest for murder.   What? Goddamn it.   Poovey? Huh? Oh.   Now we\'ll see how you like getting your tits screwed off for a change.   [snickering] Wh   What?  Remember? \'Cause you screwed his wife\'s tits off.   Damn it, Poovey! What? Figuratively!  Well, either way, I can tell you right now I    Wait.  Did you say "a change" or just "change," as in spare change?  Huh! What change? They\'ll be passing you around for half a pack of smokes.   Pff! I\'m worth at least two packs.   Pff! You know.   And, Poovey, book her as a Jane Doe.   [gasps]  A what?  Oh, shit.   [theme]   [Archer] Well, at least let me talk to her.   [Poovey] No.  I told you, you can\'t.   Little Miss Vanderpanties is in solitary,  down in the sub basement.  Yeah.  And why do you think that is?  How the hell should I know?  Wh   Because you do! No, I don\'t.   Are you booking Charlotte as a Jane Doe?  He\'s gonna keep her locked up here,  call her parents posing as a kidnapper,  and use the ransom money to square things with Len Trexler  for losing his Chinese sex slaves!  Oh.  Thought you meant besides that.   The Chinese sex slaves, by the way, that you let goooo!  Keep your frickin\' voice down.  [groans] Ow!  And speaking of which, where the hell are they?  [gong bangs] [chattering in Chinese]  Your house? Are you shitting me?  Aw, I wouldn\'t shit you.  You\'re my favorite turd.   But what are you gonna do with them, Poovey?  What\'s your long term plan?  [chattering continues] [shouting in Chinese]  [groans] Like living with a bunch of roosters.   That\'s your plan? Well, it\'s a plan.   I mean, obviously, we\'ll put it to a vote, but    Not after I tell Figgis   [grunts] Ow!  Don\'t be stupid.  If you want me to talk him out of this murder rap,  you\'ll keep your damn piehole shut!  Poovey.  Poovey!  I could actually go for some pie.   Come on! Come on! Move your asses!  Yeah, yeah, keep on bitching, if ya want me to bust your heads open for ya.   Hey, uh, could I order some pie? Or have you singlehandedly  depleted the global strategic pie reserves?  Whoo! Are you crazy? You wanna get yourself killed?  Oh, my God! Is diabetes contagious?  Hang on.  Tsk.  I know you from Dreamland.   Dreamland? Do you know Lana Kane?  We\'re her band, man.  I\'m Floyd.   This is Verl.  That\'s Cliff, and that\'s    Ray Gillette.  I\'m kind of the bandleader.   We didn\'t vote on that.  No, you\'re not.   I\'m Archer.  I\'m a private eye,  doing a little work for your boss, Mother.   So what are you in here for?  Well, murder, but technically,  it was just gross abuse of a corpse.   How about you guys? What are you in for?  Yeah, Ray.  What are we in here for?  [inhaling sharply] Okay.  My turn.   Okay.  Hey, come on.  Let me   Hey, relax.   Hold on.  You\'re gonna get yours.  You\'ll get a turn, man.   Can I please   Ray, take it easy, man.   Goddamn it! I insist you let me share your marijuana cigarette!  [muffled grunt, snort]  Well, serves y\'all right for being so damn stingy.   Serves who right? "Whom. "  How is six years in jail right?  Six years? For one lousy goof butt?  [sighs] It\'s our second offense.   I am lovin\' this marijuana cigarette!  [muffled grunt, snort]  Or it will be, once they run our prints and figure out we gave \'em fake names.   Ha! Oh, man, was my fake name not the best?  I swear, I am such a pistol.   You\'re lucky I don\'t have a pistol.   Or even a belt.  Or even shoelaces.   What if I told you I could get you guys outta here, no charges filed?  I need your help to do it, though.  To do what, exactly?  Escape, obviously.   What? What do we have to do?  Well, for starters, I\'m gonna need you to forgive me.   Forgive you? For wh   [vomiting]  Damn, Ray! Really? Ugh!  Damn, man! Why the hell\'d you do that? [vomiting continues]  Hey, guard, we got a sick man in here!  Aw, man, I\'m gonna be sick too.   No, you are not.  Well, I am.   Guard! You assholes!  Whoever puked in my cell, I\'m gonna make ya mop it up and suck on the mop!  [vomiting] [groans]  [vomiting] Oh, man! [vomiting]  Goddamn it! [chuckles] Seriously.   Oh, you think that\'s funny, you shit heel? Oh, sorry.   I\'m just a sucker for physical comedy.  Case in point  [grunting]  [chokes]  Daaaamn!  Remind me never to rent you a mule.   Why would I want to rent a mule?  Maybe you\'re afraid of commitment.  So, listen.   What do you think about our chances of getting out of here?  Hmm.  I don\'t know.   Four? Out of five?  [grunts] Why not?  [Mother] I\'m sorry.  I must have misheard you.   Because it sounded like you said you\'re not doing your second set.   I don\'t have a band.  They never came back from their smoke break.   Bet they got arrested again.  Idiots.   What is it with you people and reefer?  Do you mean musicians or Negroes? Pick one.   No, because I\'m going home now, so    You most certainly are not.  Get up there and entertain those people.   How? Do you want me to do a striptease?  Hmm.  That was a joke.   Well, clearly.  [stammers]  But I wonder.  What if we had a comedy night?  Comedians, little routines  And where the hell is the bartender?  [woman] Excuse me.  Excuse me.   Excuse me! Doctor, where are you taking this patient?  Yeah, what do we got going on here?  Tests.  Just some routine tests.   Okay, let\'s get you dancin\', handsome.   I am handsome.   Maybe I could do a comedy routine.   I mean, how hard could that be?  [Cliff] Seriously? [Archer] What?  You look like a rodeo clown.   [chuckles] You\'ve clearly never been to a rodeo.   Aw, brother, I have.   That was the circus.   No.  There were lions.   Look, man, Verl\'s got to be the cop.   I mean, you know, no offense, but    The fact that you feel like you have to say "no offense"    Moot! Wait.  What?  What? Moot.  It\'s my plan.   I\'m the cop.  [scoffs] Come on.   You look like you should be policing a cornfield.   Arresting crows and shit.   Caw! Caw! Seriously.   No.  I\'m the cop.   For one thing, I have military experience, so    Me and Verl were in the army.  And I was in the navy.   Well, but, you know, I didn\'t segregate the service.   And no offense, but   But here it comes.   Well, but what did you do, exactly?  I was in the Transport Corps.  I was a steward.   Exactly.  So, you know    Oh, I get it.  So, no matter how eager  Negroes were to prove ourselves in combat,  thanks to segregation, most of us had to serve in support units.   And driving trucks and serving coffee don\'t exactly make us war heroes.   No.  Come on.  Look, I realize that a segregated service is just crazy.   Especially when you think about what we were fighting for over there, but    Oh, so now you got a "but. " But if you think about it,  the most racist thing would be if whenever there was a war,  we only sent Negroes.   Wow! Words fail me.   I failed my induction screening.  Well, obviously.   You put the "F" in "4 F. " You know    Okay, Verl can be the cop.  But I\'m still squad leader.   And I need you guys to respect that.   Come on.  Come on.  Move your lazy asses.   Oh, that\'s good.  That\'s good, Verl.  Very believable.   Will you quit jamming my ass with that thing?  He said, coyly.  Silence, prisoner.   [men chuckling] Yeah.  Shut up.   And the next cop we see, I\'m getting his uniform.   So [sighs] [door opens]  Damn it.   Complete and total bullshit.  Dress that line, boy!  [men chuckling] Talk about looking like a scarecrow.   Caw! Caw! Doesn\'t even work there, so  So, hey, I\'m not an architect, but I\'m pretty sure  you can\'t leave a building through the sub basement.   So, unless they keep all the fingerprint cards down here    In the dampest part of the building    What the hell are we doing down here?  Well, um, it\'s a surprise.   Oh, goody! Let me guess.   Is it, uh, a truck full of my Chinese whores?  Uh, better.  Oh!  A slightly larger truck full of my Chinese whores?  Even better.  I feel like we\'re gonna run out  of things to fill with Chinese whores.  No.   You\'ll forget all about them when you hear what I\'ve got for you.   Intriguing.  [chuckles]  All right.  Give me a hint.   Two words: Charlotte Vandertunt.   [gasps] The heiress to the vast Vandertunt publishing fortune?  And, by inference, an ideal target for kidnapping.   I\'m not kidnapping a Vandertunt.   You don\'t have to.  I already did.   Are you serious? Oh, Figgis, that is some good work.   Where is she? Downtown, booked in as a Jane Doe.   You got her in that shitty jail?  No! You go get her, and you bring her here.   But   "But" nothing, ya little weasel.   Bring her to me.  I want to meet her.   Oh, I bet she\'s charming.   [screaming]  [screaming continues] What   What is happening right now?  That\'s what I\'m trying to   What the hell is wrong with you?  Everything!  I spent my life in jail, and now I\'m a disgusting old woman!  [overlapping chatter] What is she talking about?  My God, the future is terrifying!  How many years have I been in here?  Wha   [chuckles] It\'s been, like, a half an hour.   What? No, but [breathing heavily]  But then   How    [whispering] How are there Negro policemen?  Uh, definitely Negro policemen.  [overlapping chatter]  I   But   I mean, since when?  In L. A. ? I wanna say  Was it 1886?  Yep.  Patrolman Robert W.  Stewart.   Big Beat Walkin\' Bob.   They called him that? How should I know?  [sighs] Uh  [chuckles] Well, then, I don\'t know what to say.   I am simply mortified.   Please accept my apology.  I  [chuckles] You\'re my first Negroes.   So, was this a surprise?  Because I already know a crazy lady.  His Aunt Marva.   Eats paper.  By the pound.  Mm hmm.  God bless that mess.   So, no.  The surprise is, we\'re gonna seriously jeopardize  our own chance of escaping by taking her with us.   [discontented overlapping chatter]  [Poovey] I say we put it to a vote.  [sighs]  I vote no.   Poovey, come on.  Don\'t do this.   Make me.  I mean, don\'t make me.   Look, I know you cops have to check your weapons up front,  and there\'s five of us and only one of you, so    So who wants their ass beat first? [bones crack]  And before you decide, keep in mind I\'m gradually gonna get more tired,  but also gradually more berserker.   [shrieks in delight]  This is the best day ever!  [shrieks]  Being a Negro must be so exciting.   [applause] [Lana] Thank you.   Oh, thank you.  Oh, you\'re too kind.   How\'s everybody doing tonight?  Doing good? Having a swell time?  [snorts] Yeah? Everybody having fun?  Painting the town red? Wonderful!  Terrific.   So, I\'m gonna want a rematch.   [breathily] Me too.   What in the hell is she doing?  I\'ll tell you who\'s not having fun.   Al Capone.  He just died.  You hear about this?  Yep.  He died of syphilis.   Wouldn\'t wanna be that broad, would ya? [laughs]  [in ditzy voice, Brooklyn accent] Hi, Alphonse?  Yeah, it\'s me, Trixie.   Yeah, so, I was just callin\'  to say thanks for a such a lovely evenin\'.   Yeah, me too.   Uh huh.  Uh huh.   Yeah, so listen, um  Tsk.  [sighs]  [audience member coughs] [in normal voice] You know, like she\'s calling  notorious criminal Al Capone to tell him she gave him syphilis.   That\'s   That\'s pretty awkward, right?  Although she was probably a prostitute.   And why you\'d give your phone number to a prostitute  So   So what else?  [Poovey coughing]  You know how pissed off Figgis is gonna be  when he finds out you walked off with his million dollar payday?  Roughly the same as if he finds out about your new Chinese sister wives?  [gong bangs] [women exclaiming]  Oh, goody.   [exclaiming continues] Another sweater.   [sighs] All right, Archer.  You win this round.   Yeah.  I mean, you\'re handcuffed to a pipe, so obviously.   Hey, let\'s go.    We\'ll go when your squad leader says we\'ll go.   Which is now.  Let\'s go.   Hang on.  We still gotta get our fingerprint cards.   Oh, right.  Where do they keep them?  Second floor, Room 202.   But good luck getting in there without a   [alarm blaring]  [braying laughter]  A distraction.  Nice!  [Poovey] I was gonna say   Ooh! Sprinklers! Nice!  The key, you dickheads!  Ohh, right.  Duh.   Whew.  What else?  Uh   Oh, prostitutes and, uh, syphilis.  Okay.   So, I heard about a male prostitute who got syphilis.   Yeah.  Apparently, he was fine for a while,  but then business kind of dropped off.   Reminds me   Uh, reminds me of my cousin Eddie.   Uh, he goes to see the family doctor.  Doctor says,  [in masculine voice] "Well, I\'ve got some good news and bad news.   The bad news is, your wife has syphilis. "  "My God," Eddie says, "what\'s the good news?" Doctor says,  [in masculine voice] "Good news is, she didn\'t get it from you  [laughs] "based on this  medical examination. " [faint coughing]  All right.  Let\'s   Let\'s see what else I got here.   Uh, syphilis, syphilis,  syphilis, syphilis, syphilis, syphilis, syphilis  Oh, hey! How \'bout that Taft Hartley Act?  [man] Show us your tits!  I mean  Oh, jeez, I\'m getting wet! [clamoring]  [Archer] Will you hurry up? Hang on.   I got everybody\'s but mine.  Uh  [cackling]  Here it is! Oh, my God.   Oh, it\'s hilari    [laughing]  "Phil McCracken. "  [laughing continues]  [siren wailing] Right?  What the hell is going on here?  Uh, do what now? I said, what the hell\'s going on here?  [clears throat] It\'s a   a prisoner   prisoner transport.   Uh, taking these reefer addicts over to Newton Street    Oh, well   for treatment and counseling.   Nope.  For what?  Damn it, Floyd.  Floyd? Wh    Why did he   Wait a minute.   What\'s your badge and unit number? F Four?  What? [grunts]  [goofy laughter]  Okay, you are just terrifying.  [squeals, brays]  Shut it, McCracken.  And "treatment and counseling"?  Seriously? [Floyd] What?  I bet in the long run it\'s more economical.   Just get in the truck.  [engine starts]  Yeah, I\'m getting in the truck because I choose to get into the truck.   I   Wait! Take me with you.   We are.  Oh.   Well, then, I shall thank you to mind your tone.   [alarm continues blaring] [shouting] What?  [shouting] I said    [alarm stops] [normal voice] Oh.   I said, "Archer got away. " Oh, that son of a    As did the Vandertunt broad.   What? How could you let that happen?  There were five of \'em!  And I had to check my gun, obviously, so I    See you didn\'t check yours.   No.  No, there was so much confusion.   Yeah, right?  Right.  For instance, I\'m confused  about why I don\'t just go ahead  and shoot you in your stupid fat face.   Well, for one thing   [gasps] Noooo!  [ringing in ears] [muted] Okay, you dummy.  So tonight, right now,  you\'re gonna find the Vandertunt broad, and you\'re gonna find Archer.   You\'re gonna bring her to Trexler\'s, and you\'re gonna leave him in some alley  [gibberish] with a case of lead poisoning, just like his partner.   [normal volume] You got it? Mawp.  Mawp.   That better have been a long ass apology.   [Mother] I\'m sorry, what was that?  No, just, if I had more time, I   I could really tighten up my set.   Oh, I don\'t know how you\'d improve on a solid half hour about syphilis.   Wait.  What? Ew!  What I do know is all the refunds I gave  are coming out of your paycheck.   But   You\'ve got a "but"?  I\'ll say.  Zip it, Missy.   And, come to think of it, the refunds will come  out of all your paychecks!  Damn it, Ray! That\'s some bullshit.   And I swear to God, if you people get caught  smoking reefers again   I\'m sorry.  By "you people," do you mean    Out! All of you, out!  Not so fast, Shamus.   [sighs] Damn it.   Hey, not that it should matter, but I was a tanker.   761st Tank Battalion.   Wait.  Patton\'s Panthers?  You guys saved our asses at the Bulge.   Mm hmm.  Well, now I feel like an asshole.   Well, can\'t help you with that.   [Mother] Archer! And that little chippie of yours.   [laughs] I beg your pardon?  Keep it up, and you will.  Wait.  What?  I\'m not accustomed to being stood up, Mr.  Archer, and yet once again    I know, and I\'m sorry.  It\'s just    Well, she isn\'t just some chippie.   She\'s actually Charlotte Vandertunt.   I   You mean, the heiress to the vast Vandertunt publishing fortune?  Uh, duh.  Zerp.   Then do tell.  What\'s a nice heiress like you  doing in a joint like this? I rescued her.   Len Trexler and that cop Figgis were gonna kidnap her, so    How were they going to do that?  Well, nobody knows where she is, so    I\'m trying to escape a quasi incestuous family situation.   How? A four.   Eh.  Yeah, so    So, presumably, the Vandertunt family  still doesn\'t know where she is?  I mean, don\'t know how they would.   Excellent.   [gasps] Oh, shit.  What?  [Mother] Well, then, I suggest you wake him.   Unless you think Mr.  Vandertunt would rather see his daughter gradually  via the mail.   [joyous squealing] [tapping floor]  [high pitched laugh]  Best day ever!  [growls]  Right?1 [yawns]  [sniffs]  So, uh, what are we doing? Are we just    Do you not see the phone to my ear?  I   I do, but   What?  I said, I   You think this is some sort of joke?  Maybe the one about the interrupting cow? Moo!  Shut up.  Look, I   [growls]  Listen, you had just better put Mr.  Vandertunt  on the line this instant!  Well, then, go find him.  [gasps]  Oh.  Well, then    Hello? Ass! Apparently that was your brother.   What? Cecil?  [growls loudly] [growls]  Seriously.  And let me guess    He   Let me guess!  He said he didn\'t believe that I\'d been kidnapped.    Yes, he    Has this happened before?  No.  I don\'t know.   Well, he   Hey, do you need me for this?  Yes! Because I\'ve been awake for, like, three days.   Your point being? I desperately need sleep?  You can sleep when you\'re dead.  It may literally come to that.   Because Len Trexler is going to be left holding a very empty bag on this.   And to make that happen, I need you to drive out to Vandertunt Castle  and convince the old man I\'ll mail her home in several different boxes.   [growls] But not really,  though, right? Well    No! Well    Look [yawns] I can\'t drive  way the hell out there without some sleep.  I    [singsongy] I have Dexedrine.   Ah, and the universe provides.  [pills rattle]  Okay, so, once I\'m out there, [pills crunching]  how am I supposed to convince Vandertunt you\'re serious?  Take him a finger.   Huh? But not one of mine, though, right?  No! Well    I\'m not taking him anybody\'s finger.   I\'m just trying to save you a trip.  How    I mean, you don\'t want to drive all the way out there just to have him say,  "On second thought, to make this happen, we\'re going to need a finger. "  Nobody has ever said, "To make this happen, we\'re going to need a finger. "  Oh, you\'d be surprised.   [shudders]   The last thing I wanted to get mixed up in is  a kidnapping, even one as phony as a three dollar bill.   Because doing a stretch in jail would be the least of my worries.   Vandertunts have enough juice in this town to make sure  I never even see the inside of a cell.   So I am not looking forward to this.   Plus I bet that creepy old joint\'s  as haunted as Mrs.  Muir\'s twat.   Hmm.  I know, right?  Oh, also, when I said I\'d take you to the bus station  [tires screeching] [man yells]  [exclaiming] [laughing]  [Figgis] Typical Archer.   Figures he\'d be a goddamn slob.   Uh, I think maybe somebody tossed the place?  Oh.  Yeah.  Maybe.   Wonder what they were after.   Who knows? Maybe some poor dumb bastard broke in here  to steal back the photos of his cheatin\' wife gettin\'  [clears throat] Sorry.   Why   I was gonna say "flap hammered. "  Why do you constantly bring that up?  What, Archer hammering your wife? Yes!  In her flaps? Yes!  [muffled audible shrug] [sighs] Okay.   Well, we\'re not gonna find any clues to lead us  to Charlotte Vandertunt in this dump, so let\'s    Yeah.  There\'s no telling where she is.   [mock gasp] And if we don\'t know where she is?  It\'s frustrating?  No.  Then nobody knows where she is.   Uh huh.  Including her father!  Yep.  Which means we can just tell him  we kidnapped her, collect the ransom ourselves, and then pay off Trexler!  Ohh.  Okay.  Yeah.   But on some level, it\'s also gotta be pretty frustrating.   Not as frustrating as you!  In the meantime, she was at Dreamland with Archer the other night.   [line ringing] So go snoop around, see if you turn up anything.   [chuckling] Besides a cold brewski, am I right?  Hello? Yes, Vandertunt Castle, please.   Damn it, I don\'t care if the number\'s unlisted! This is a police emergency!  Thank you.   That worked? Why are you still here?  Yes, hello.  This is, uh    [clears throat] uh, ze kidnapperz.   [wheezy, gravelly voice] Please hold the wire.   I apologize for the heat.  It\'s positively tropical in here.   But that\'s how Father prefers it.   Can he hear us?  Oh, yes.  He\'s just being rude.   [loudly] Father, say hello to Charlotte\'s kidnapper.   No, no   I I I didn\'t kidnap her.   I\'m just sort of a go between.   A fine distinction, legally speaking.   I know, but look, I\'m just trying to make sure she gets home safely.   In exchange for one million dollars.   According to the person, or persons, who asked me to deliver the message.   Whom I\'m sure she\'s boring senseless  with her constant raving about incest.   Uh, I wouldn\'t know about that.  Oh, it\'s when, uh    I know what it is.  [quietly] Did you know it\'s forbidden?  Everybody knows it\'s forbidden.   Oh, you\'d be surpri   Yes, Pelham?  [wheezy, gravelly whispering] Mm hmm.  Mm hmm.   Ohh.  Mm hmm!  Yes, I think a finger should suffice.   Oh, is he taking drink orders? \'Cause I could go for a couple of fingers of Old Buncombe.   Like, a whole handful.  At 7:00 a. m. , you care for bourbon.   Deeply.  Very well.   Finish your call, Pelham, and then Mr.  Archer needs a drink.   I hate to say "need. "  Well   Yeah.   Pelham has had the most interesting telephone call.   Tell me, Mr.  Archer, does, or do,  your person, or persons, possess an accent vaguely Germanic?  That\'s pretty confusing, but no.   Most confusing, yes, because such a person  is on the telephone just now, claiming that he is the kidnapper.   "He"? I mean, what? Th That\'s impossible.   Yes, even Charlotte isn\'t stupid enough  to get herself kidnapped by two different kidnappers at once.   Well   Which means one of you is lying.   So I\'m afraid I shall have to ask for proof you actually have Charlotte.   What kind of   Wait.  Oh, no.   Yes.  I\'m afraid I require a finger.   I I could bring you her.  Just drive by the house.  She can wave to you.   Mmmmmmmmmmm, no.   I   That\'s     Then how about a photo of her holding today\'s newspaper?  Mmmm, well, now, that could work.  Yeah, it\'s    Just make sure that she\'s holding the newspaper with nine fingers.   Aw, goddamn it.   Well, actually seven.  What?  You know, not counting her thumbs.   And then, obviously, bring me her severed finger  and the photograph so that I may compare the two.   [sighs] Yeah.  Um, obviously.   Father, say good bye to Charlotte\'s ostensible kidnapper!  [sighs] So I guess that\'s a no on the bourbon?  Yes.  Good bye.   [sighs] Where the hell am I supposed to find a finger?  Hello? Hello?  Hey, listen to me.  Whoever you are,  and whatever this whole thing is, I don\'t want it.   Well, I\'m very sorry to hear that.   Well, too bad, because   Because you\'re getting it,  whether you want it or not.   So, let\'s get to it, shall we?  No.  Look   Look, listen.   I didn\'t know, okay?  I thought this was gonna be, like,  some pull on fake feet, man, not   not    Oh, sweet Jesus Lord God Christ, not some freaky metal robot legs!  [meows] That\'ll do, Schnuckiputzi.   [meows] And also, it\'s not just the legs.   No, you crazy Kraut bastard, I don\'t want any part of those parts!  But your employer, Mr.  Trexler, does.  It\'s not his body!  Look, I\'m just following orders.   What? That\'s what the Nazis said!  Okay, yeah, tell me about Nazis.   [grunting]  [slurred] What is taking so long?  [speaking German]  [meows]  I said, that will do!  [purring]  [slurping]  Mm.   Mm.  What a load of shit.   I should be looking for my partner\'s killer,  but instead I\'m looking for a damn finger.   [tires screeching] [belches]  [gulps, belches]  [hot dog thuds]  [Poovey grunts] [body thuds]  [body being dragged]  [sawing] [Krieger humming]  [sawing stops] [humming stops]  [sawing resumes] [humming resumes]  [sighs]  [speaking German]  [air raid siren in distance]  [sighs]  [sighs]  Well,  I hate to say I told you so.  Do you?  No.  It\'s one of the few great pleasures in life.   Hang on.  Do you live in here? No, you ass!  I live in the ten room penthouse apartment upstairs.   Oh.  You don\'t happen to have  a bunch of surplus fingers up there, do ya?  What do you think? Honestly?  Hardy har har.   If you need a finger, just take one.   But   No, I\'m not cutting off her  [snoring loudly]  Man, that septum is deviated, huh?  That\'s not her.   [Archer] Poovey? Mm hmm.   Tried to break into the club first thing this morning.   I assume looking for Drooling Beauty over there.   Yeah, you really threw a monkey wrench into Figgis\' plan.   His plan? Yeah, to ransom her off.   Why? Wh   To pay back Trexler.   For what? What are you    For the sex slaves Trexler was gonna    Oh, I get it!  Do you? You\'re saying this is all my fault.   Isn\'t it? I   Look, this whole fiasco started  because I came to you for help!  Exactly.  Whose fault is that?  Son of a   That is so    So now I gotta go find a goddamn finger?  And if I were you, I\'d take one of her rings to put on it.   They say the devil\'s in the details.   And silk pajamas.  What?  Get up, you lummox! Huh?  Wuzza   What the   Archer?  Get up, dummy.  We gotta go.   You better pray to God it wasn\'t you who hit me,  because whoever it was  hits like a weak little bitch of a girl,  who was born with some kind of little bitch of a birth defect,  so that instead of a fist, she just has this tiny little bitch of a  nubbin.   And I guess I\'ll drive, since you clearly have a concussion.   Yeah, not feeling great.   [smacking lips]  [gulps] Ahh.   You know you\'re killing me, right? Sorry,  are you talking to me, or just meat stuffed intestines in general?  Figgis is counting on that ransom money.   I can\'t double cross him again.  Why not?  Because if he finds out, somebody\'s gonna find me in a hole in the desert.   [laughs] No, they\'re not.  Exactly!  Look, it\'s your own fault for doing right by all those Chinese broads.   Talk about no good deed.  It was a good deed.   And now I need you to help me do another good deed.   Defraud an old man out of a million dollars using a severed human finger.   And reunite a family.   Of daughter and sister bangers.   Alleged daughter and sister bangers.   [sighs]  [muffled] Well, let\'s go to the morgue.   That\'s the spirit.  [gulps]  [hot dog thuds] [tires screeching]  [belches]  [man] Excuse me?  I said, I\'m looking for a corpse.   White, female, mid 30s, fresh, within, say, the last 12 hours.   Jesus Christ, every full moon.   Beat it, ya sicko, before I call the cops.   I am the cops, asshole! I\'m working a missing persons!  Well, maybe lead with that, huh?  Just buzz me in, ya hump.  [door buzzing]  [gulps, belches] [Archer] Jesus Christ.   What is it, National Hot Dog Day? No.   There isn\'t one.  Yet!  Can you Oh, right.  LAPD.  We\'re looking for a    Missing persons, yeah.  White female, 30s, brand newly deceased.   Your jerk off partner\'s already back there.   [sighs] Our what?  Eyeglasses, dark hair, gray at the temples,  mouth like somebody used a tomato capper to scoop out a pig\'s asshole  and glued it under his nose?  Aw, shit! [door buzzing]  Are you nuts?  Do you wanna get caught? We\'re not gonna get caught.   Now shut up, put these on, and follow my lead.   Aw, jeez.  He\'s really doing it.   [sighs] Sorry, lady.   But if you think about it, which I guess you can\'t,  this whole thing is Archer\'s fault, so  [muffled gag] [whispering] Will you get in position?!  [quietly] Okay! Jesus!  Okay.  Jesus.   On one, two  Ohhhh  [crunch] [disgusted groaning]  [Archer, in English accent] Great Scott! Wha    Don\'t you move, you sick bugger!  No   No, no   This   This isn\'t   I I can explain.   You\'re damn right you will   to the bobbies!  By which I mean the police!  I am the police.   Well?  Well, whaaa    Holy shit! I can\'t believe I did that!  I can\'t believe it took you so damn long.   What, are you hourly? Pfft!  [muffled] No.  Wh    Where the hell did you get that?  It was just sitting there.   That could\'ve been inside somebody.   [muffled grunting]  [gulps, sighs]  Well, it is now.   [belches]  Anything, whatever, a little box.   [Poovey] Aren\'t we supposed to put it in milk?  But   That\'s for a tooth, dummy,  if you\'re gonna put it back in somebody.   Yeah, that makes more sense.  Now, what are we gonna do about him?  [chuckles] I actually have some thoughts on that.   He\'ll freeze to death in there!  No, he won\'t.  I\'ll call them in, like, half an hour.   Oh.  Wait, wait, wait, wait.  What?  [chuckling] Strip him.   Really wish we hadn\'t have done that.   I can never unsee him naked.   I mean, the size of that thing.   Hollow that big bastard out, you could use it for an umbrella stand.   Ugh!  Goddamn it! What?  [Cecil] Oh, I suppose I\'m just surprised.   Why? You said you wanted her finger,  so, you know, here\'s her finger.   It\'s really in there? See for yourself.   Mmmmmmmmmm, no.   I\'m sorry?  I trust you.  Unless What?  [shouting] Father, do you wanna see  Charlotte\'s ostensible severed finger?  No.  We\'re good.   Are you   This could be anything!  It could be a piece of a hot dog!  Eww! Don\'t you start!  You say it\'s her finger, I take you at your word.   And I assume you\'ll be in touch shortly with complicated instructions  for the exchange of the ransom money for my horrible sister?  I mean  [Mother] Good.   Then it\'s all settled.  Yeah.  Uh, I guess.   I\'ll expect the ransom within 24 hours, so you\'ll see to that.   But   And then you\'re gonna help me find my partner\'s killer, right?  All in good time, Mr.  Archer.   Right.  [Charlotte inhales deeply]  [yawns]  Is it just me [sniffs]  or does it smell like finger?  [device ratcheting] [vital signs monitor beeping]  [sighs] Almost there.   So close.   [distant explosions]  [speaking German]  [sighs]  Oh!  [sighs]  [chuckles]  [both gasp]  [weapons cocking]  [cat]  [gasps]  [whistles] [clacking]  [growling]  [general, men]  [barking, growling] [shouting in German]  [men yelling, screaming]  [screaming continues] [growling continues]  [meows, purrs]  [crying]  [explosions grow closer]  [explosions continue]  [dogs growling, snarling] [nurse screaming]  [clicking tongue] Tu tu.   [meows]  [purring] Yeah, you\'re just a widdle whore  for the cuddles, huh?  Okay, I gotta get some sleep.   You be a good girl.  Who\'s a good girl?  Yeah, you\'re a good girl.   [chuckling]  [laughing]  [whirring, clicking]  [maniacal laughter]1 [Schnuckiputzi purring]  So, uh, what are we doing?  Are we just jumping right into this, or what\'s the deal?  [Krieger whistling] [door opens]  [growls]  Alrighty! And how\'s our patient?  And, follow up, where is our patient? [meows]  Meaning? [meows]  Okay, you know what?  You\'re about as helpful as tits on a    [yells] You!  [meows] Look what you\'ve done to me!  [hoarse voice] Yeah, right? I\'m a monster!  You\'re a miracle! You didn\'t even have feet!  Now look at you, walking around on new legs,  with hands that can crush steel    [high pitched voice] And, I mean, don\'t try it right now, obviously, but    [gasping] Look at me!  I\'m a goddamn freak!  And I don\'t know who I\'m gonna kill first,  you or that son of a bitch Len Trexler.   Well, first of all, it\'s "whom. "  Uh, no, it isn\'t.  It absolutely is.   Doesn\'t matter.  But if it\'ll help you decide  This serum, which is sort of the key to the whole deal, I call Factor K.   And?   And your body will reject its new components,  and you will die in agony, unless you get an injection of it.   Wha   Well, give it here, shitbeard.   Uhh! Goddamn it.   Ow.  Okay, that kind of hurt,  and I\'m already in a pretty bad mood,  so I\'m gonna kill you first.   So, any last words?  Every 12 hours.   Cryptic.  Nice.  Usually people just blubber and beg,  and those big gloobs of snot run outta their nose, but you    If you don\'t get a shot of Factor K every 12 hours, you will die.   Bullshit.  Which   And that\'s fair, but    Let me guess.  You\'re only gonna make enough for one injection at a time.   [chuckling] Well, I am now.   Goddamn it! Yeah, so, like an insurance policy.   How long does it take you to make it? I don\'t know.  An hour?  Well, then, I guess I\'ll wake you up in about 11 hours.   Wake me   [grunts] [body thuds]  What the   Are you  Dreamland has a whole goddamn  Nazi robot farm in the basement.   In this economy!  [Figgis] Hello?  Hello! Son of a    Hang on.  [lighter clicks]  What the   Oh, for the love of cocks!  [sighs] I mean, seriously, just  Goddamn it.   [opening theme]   Hello! Can anybody hear me?  Man, that thing is outta control.   Hello! Hello!  Somebody! Hey! [flame whooshes]  What the   No, no, no, no, no, no, no!  Help! My pubes! [sobbing] [thudding]  My goddamn pubes are on fire!  [muffled] All right.  I guess let him out.   Now that second lunch is ruined.   [sobbing, yelling] [coughing]  Aw, man! Some of it got in my mouth.   [scoffs] How long was I in there?  How should I know? Usually dead people don\'t just climb out of these drawers  with their big bushy birds on fire,  so for all I know, you\'re that zombie  that got walked with! That what?  In the movie I Walked with a Zombie.  The zombie titular.   I\'m not a goddamn   I am Lieutenant Cyril Figgis, LAPD, you sentient shit sacks!  I showed you my shield! And if you\'d show it to me again    I don\'t   Whoever hit me took it.   [gasps] Goddamn it! And my service weapon!  And yet they left you your lighter.   Wait.  When I got pistol whipped, I was talking to an English guy.   We don\'t have an English guy.  I   You have to remember me!  Uh, actually, I don\'t.  And also, I don\'t, so    Oh, you think you\'re pretty smart, huh? I mean, smart enough to know  you cut a finger off one of my cadavers   Which, ew.   And also gross abuse of a corpse, which is punishable by    I know all about gross abuse of a corpse!  Yeah, that\'s kind of my whole point.  [growls]  As the Lord our God Himself is my witness,  upon the conclusion of my current business,  I shall return to this place  and visit upon you an apocalypse of such terror and destruction  that you will rue   rue the very fact of your miserable birth!  I\'ll be here.   I actually won\'t.  Well, unless it\'s before Friday.   Oh, yeah, that\'s right.  What\'s it you\'re leaving to do?  Lumber inspector.  Huh.  Didn\'t know that was a thing.   That\'s because you have no vision.   This, Danny   [sniffs] this is your world.   Yeah.   Please, Figgis, for your sake, tell me you\'re joking.   It\'s just a temporary setback, but I am going to fix this, trust me.   That\'s the whole point.  I don\'t trust you.   I wouldn\'t trust you to fix potato [bleep] salad!  You\'re probably one of those assholes who puts relish in it!  I mean, first my whores, and now Charlotte Vandertunt?  How many women can one man lose?  Oh, plus your wife.  Would you    Oh! Mr.  Trexler,  I swear to God that I will get you your million dollars.   You know, you say that with the confidence of a man who has a lot longer to live.   I   [click, dial tone]  How\'d that go?  How do you think it went?  Not great.  Ya think?  Yes.  Because while I was getting pistol whipped  and shoved in a drawer at the morgue    losing precious time, not to mention my gun and my shield    you were supposed to find Charlotte Vandertunt.   And, so, how did that go? [pounds desk]  Also not great.  But more importantly    Because we know Archer broke her out of jail,  and we know he\'s working for Mother, so    Son of a bitch! I bet she\'s gonna try to ransom Charlotte!  Wait.  Shut up.  "More importantly" what?  What is that smell? What is what smell?  [sniffs] That.  Smells like cuy.   What the hell is cuy? Roasted guinea pig.   Huh? They blowtorch the hair right off of it.   It\'s like the national dish of Peru.  [sighs] Did    Or is it Ecuador? Did you    Which one\'s the native habitat of the spectacled bear?  Did   Wait.  Shit.  They both are.   Hang on.  Uh, hey, let me see your service weapon.   Huh? Yeah.  Here.   Now, Peru has the pisco sour, but    Did you find Charlotte Vandertunt? Tell me before, so help me God,  I put a bullet in your big fat stupid face!  [clears throat] First of all, that\'s just hurtful.   And second of all,  it doesn\'t matter where she is, just where the ransom money is.   Hmm.  Presumably with the Vandertunts.   So all we gotta do is    Insinuate ourselves into this whole deal,  like we\'re there to help, and steal the ransom during the exchange.   Yeah.  It\'s a piece of piss.  Now, aren\'t you glad you didn\'t shoot me?  [sighs] For now.  Although I\'m sure at some point I\'ll regret that decision, so    Why is there blood on the barrel?  What? No.  That\'s, um, hot sauce.   Well, why is there hot sauce on it?  With a couple of hairs stuck in it.   Oh, sweet Christ.  What?  Did you beat a guinea pig to death with your service weapon,  slather the thing in hot sauce and eat it?  Yep!  Well, I officially regret my decision.   [chuckling] Man, I almost always do.   [gong bangs] [chattering in Chinese]  Hey! Who keeps leaving the goddamn seat down?  Looking your way, Huizhong.   [Poovey] So, how are we gonna play this with the Vandertunts?  We\'re gonna play it that you keep your fat mouth shut    Again, hurtful.  while I explain to them  that the cavalry is finally here.   Yes, it\'s right here, as per your demand    a million dollars in unmarked, untraceable  20, 50, and 100 dollar bills.   Okay.  Good.  Good.  That\'s    Sheer idiocy on your part, frankly.   I\'m sorry? As well you should be.   What do you   I mean, including the bag,  which, by the way, was a gift,  the whole thing must weigh a good 50 pounds.   Well, too bad.  I   I mean, an envelope  with a hundred Sammies would\'ve been so much easier.   A hundred what? Sammies.   After Salmon P.  Chase,  the man on the $10,000 bill?  Well, what the hell am I supposed to do with a $10,000 bill?  Well, what does one do with a twenty dollar bill?  Buy a single orange? That\'s    Just make sure the money\'s at the drop by midnight,  and that you follow my instructions to the letter.   Mmm, like a reverse scavenger hunt.  [sighs]  And once we have the money, we\'ll arrange for the return of your sister.   Oh, right.  Yes.  Sorry.  I forgot that part.   And that\'s a firm firm? Yes.   And no cops, at all, anywhere.   No police.  Also a firm firm?  Yes, it\'s a firm firm! Wait.  Why?  What? I   I don\'t know.  No reason.   I\'m sorry.  This is my first kidnapping.   Well   [in spooky voice] Or is it?  [evil chuckle] Jesus Christ.   [click, dial tone] Ciao! Alrighty, then.   Who\'s for cuy?  [Figgis yells, gags]  [muffled gag]  [sniffs] Yes,  that\'s probably why you smell burnt hair.   But don\'t judge them by their looks.   They may seem appalling [chomping]  but trust me, they\'re quite delicious.   [in spooky voice] Yes, delicious.   Like all taboos.   [muffled] You\'re frickin\' weird.   I mean, just weird.  [Lana] What is?  [gasps] Lana! Uh, I mean, Miss Kane.   I   I mean, uh   "Lana" is fine.   I\'ll say.  You\'ll say what?  Nothing.  Ah.  A man of mystery.   Well, you know, mainly in the sense that I try to solve them, you know    On your own.  Well, yeah.   I mean, since my partner died.   Which I actually should really   I meant without the police.   Without the who now?  "No cops, at all, anywhere,"  I believe were your exact words.   My exac   Were you eavesdropping on me?  Yes.   Did you have a follow up to that, or    No, actually, because you caught me totally off guard by not denying it.   But how much of that did you hear?  Depends.  What\'s your angle, shamus?  [chuckling] Well, uh, probably about 30 degrees.   [rimshot] [Gillette] Diminishing returns, Cliff!  But I\'m not working any angle, so    So, then, you wouldn\'t need any help?  No, I   Why are you so interested? No reason.   Just thought maybe you could make it worth my while.   Well, I   I can\'t, so    What if I made it worth your while?  Umm  No.   No what? Wait.  What?  What? At the club, I said, "Umm,"  and then I was gonna say, "No," but then you didn\'t let me finish.   Oh, you finished, all right.  Yeah.  Maybe try Woolite?  Which, by the way, makes one of us!  Oh, please! Wait.  Seriously? Get out.   \'Cause I\'d be happy to, you know    Get   [chuckles] st stay and watch you finish.   out! Jesus!  Look, if you   Ehh!  [sighs] Great.   Now I have no liquor.   Just a big fat pair of blue lady balls.   [meows, purrs]  [speaking German] [meows, purrs]  [spits, groans] That\'s my mouth! [whining]  Get outta here! [spits] Oh!  [spits] If I wanted your asshole on my mouth,  I\'d do it while you were asleep!  Which we\'ve never talked about, but   Ow!  My face! How long was I out?  [meows] Oh, that helps.   Man, I gotta warn Trexler Dutch wants to kill him.   Mainly because Trexler hasn\'t paid me for my work yet, but also because    Say what you will about Der Robotik Ubermenschen.  [objects clatter on floor]  Sure can punch good.   [man laughing] I\'m sorry, darlin\',  but you\'re gonna have to repeat that.   [clears throat] I said,  "I had a little towel,  "but I lost it walking here,  so I need your clothes, your boots, and your motorcycle. "  [laughter] Oh, is that all?  Yeah.  That oughta do it.   You, uh, sure you don\'t need me to, uh, check your oil?  [laughter]  Oh, okay.  And by that remark,  I assume you\'re referring either to my robotic limbs  or offering to plunge your finger, and/or penis, into my anus.   [men] Ohhh! I\'ll plunge my fist into your    [chuckles] Were you gonna say "anus"?  [bones crack] [screaming]  \'Cause a finger\'s one thing.   But a whole fist? Aaahhh!  That\'s like [yelling]  I just never understood that.   [crying out]  And I\'m not trying to judge.  [grunting]  But it\'s like, at some point, you gotta question your choices.   [yells]  Whoo!  I don\'t know.  If it\'s two consenting adults, [zipper zips up]  I\'m like, "Live and let live. "  But if you want me to let you live, chief,  I\'m gonna need those keys.   Here.  [whimpers] Take \'em!  Hey, thanks.   Oh, and if turns out you lose that arm,  just give me a call.   [chuckles] I got a guy.   He what?  Uh, is going to kill you.  Was I not    What are you talking about?  Why? Stop it!  What, I should be calm when you tell me  a goddamn robot wants to kill me?  No, not you.  Wha   Wha   Then who?  No.  Sorry.  You.  He wants to kill you.   The good news is, without my help,  he\'ll be dead in ten hours.   Okay, well, my house is a fortress.   I got a ton of guys.  We\'ll outlast him.   Yeah.  You say that  Feels pretty good, huh, Dutch? [chuckles]  Yes, it does, Other Dutch.  Yes, it does.   [sighs] Goddamn it.   I think youre confused, doll.   [Charlotte] I am not in the least confused!  I don\'t care if my family does pay the ransom.  I\'m not going back there!  I meant you were confused about me caring what you did after the payoff.   You\'re not planning to blindfold me and hide me in a bomb shelter  with limited oxygen and send my family cryptic notes  about how to find me in a race against time for my life?  Who are you, collective pseudonym Carolyn Keene?  What? Who would go to all that trouble?  Johann Schmidt, aka the Red Skull, in my Nazi kidnap slash rape fantasy.   [growls] Ew!  Right? Shut up.   Look, tonight your brother is going to drop  the ransom money at the Griffith Observatory.   Archer is going to retrieve it and bring it to me.   And if nobody screws up, once I have the money, you\'re free to go.   Well, but that\'s my whole point.   [sobs] Go where?  [growls] Who knows? Maybe a handsome  young Nazi scientist will take you in.  [door opens]  Do what now? [gasps] What the hell are you doing?  Just filling the coolers with ice.   You know, normal bartendery stuff.   Oh, so suddenly you work here again? I    What happened to your face? I    Did someone catch you snooping? [Zerk growls]  Uh, no, I walked into a door repeatedly.   Oh, yeah.  My mother used to do that.   Well, you better not have been snooping on me, mister.   Are you   Pfft! Come on! I wouldn\'t do that!  [quietly] So, Archer\'s the bagman for a kidnapping, huh?  Okay, then.   Because you know what happens to snoops.   They get poops? What?  [Cecil] It\'s just that the kidnappers  were extremely clear on that point.   No police, at all, anywhere.   Well, of course they\'re gonna say that, but trust me    I trust him.  He brought me a finger.   [chomping]  [sighs] Only you.  What?  All I had today was some cuy.  [gulps]  Oh, and congee.   Oh, and a bunch of salted duck eggs.   Look, we\'ll be right behind you, so just follow their instructions,  drop the ransom off, and with a bit of luck, we\'ll get it and the kidnappers.   Okay, but I have a bad feeling about this.  [engine starts]  Well, I don\'t care.   Hmm.  Fair enough.   Do you wanna go? [belches]  [hot dog thuds]  [Archer] I thought I made it pretty clear to the little weirdo  that I didn\'t wanna see any cops near the drop.   I guess you can\'t blame the guy for trying.   Plus it\'s not like I can\'t handle Figgis and Poovey.   But I may have to wait them out.   Whatever.  You paid for an hour.   Well, that\'s my whole point.  It may take a lot longer than an hour    Well   And I\'m not paying you any extra.   What? But feel free to hike  the five miles back to Sunset in those heels.   What the hell? Who brings a hooker?  [Cecil, quietly] Okay.  Here\'s the topiary garden.  [car door opens, closes]  Which I wish I could buy it so I could burn it to the ground.   Topiary.  My God, what rubbish.   Shrubbish! [laughs]  So freakin\' weird.  [Cecil] Hmm.   Well, I suppose that looks like a mushroom.   What? It\'s clearly a mushroom.   Well, then [grunts]  [loudly] All right, then.  I\'m off.   Alone, as I arrived, with no police anywhere!  [sighs] I mean Seriously.   Okay, Archer.  It\'s your move.   [car engine starts] Damn it.  I gotta at least tip her.   This is definitely gonna take longer than an hour.  [car departs]  Man, I wish I had a    Smoke grenade? What the shit?  [Poovey coughing] Goddamn it!  [Figgis] Will you come on?  No, no, no, no, no, no!  Goddamn it! [car departs]  [sighs] I guess it\'s not his move.  [tires screech]  [screams] Jesus!  Sorry.  Here.  Take these.   What the hell are these for? Um, I guess parting gifts?  What? I don\'t know.  Maybe you can sell \'em or whatever.   Because, listen, this car chase is gonna get a little crazy    Well, then, let me out! Stop the car!  Let me finish! Because my point is, I don\'t really have time to stop.   [screaming] But I\'m not gonna have that,  so I\'m gonna need you to kind of jump out.   Are you nuts? I\'ll slow down a little, obviously,  but when you hit the ground, [screams]  you\'re gonna wanna kind of roll.   [grunts] [body thudding]  Yeah, just like that! Good instincts!  Asshole!  Seriously!  [Figgis] They\'re gaining on us! Step on it!  Trust me, it\'s totally stepped on!  Oh, son of a [cocks gun]  Oh, shit.   [gunshots] [tires screeching]  [yells] Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no!  [engine sputters, stops]  [sighs] Goddamn it.   Did ya get \'em?  No.  I got somebody, though.   [laughing] Wow.  Good policin\'.   [cocks gun] Shut up.   Son of a [tires screeching]  No, no, no, no, no, no!  [crashing]  [crashing stops]  [coughing] Oh, goddamn it.   [crash]  So  how was your evening?  [clears throat] Uh, not g great.   [growls]  [knuckles crack]  And I assume about to get worse.1   So, uh, what are we doing?  Are we just jumping right into this, or  (muffled grunt)    (squealing laughter)   (muffled gagging)  Now, then, I assume I have your undivided attention?    (muffled): Uh huh.    Good.  Because you have mine.   And I am just dying to know  why I\'m not rolling around in a million dollars  like a kitten with a million dollars.     Grnk!   Well? I\'m waiting.   Grnk!  I\'m sorry.  All I\'m hearing is "gurnk. "  Did someone named Gurnk take it?    (muffled yelling)   Well?  I\'ve got all night.  And he\'s hourly, so    (muffled gagging)   Oh! Oh, he wants the check.     (muffled gagging continues)   No, I think a pen.     (muffled): Uh huh.    Damn it.     (gags)   Palm.   Palm reader.     (muffled) Uh uh.    Mmm palm reader?    Uh uh.    Palm reader!    Uh uh!   Palm hand  Oh.  Ooh! Handwriting! Handwriting!    (muffled yelling, gagging)   Paper.     (muffled) Uh huh.    Damn it!  There\'s a nice way to do that.   (muffled yelling, gagging)  Hard surface.   (muffled gagging)  (gasps) I just adore parlor games.   When I was a little girl, we used to    MOTHER: Don\'t do that.    Do what?  Humanize yourself.  I don\'t know  what that idiot\'s scribbling over there,  so there\'s still a chance  I\'ll have to mail somebody your foot.     Ew.    You don\'t know the half of it.   (muffled gagging)  What is this even supposed to be?    CHARLOTTE: Seriously?   (muffled gag)  Why didn\'t you just write it?    (muffled gag)   (gasps) Palm reader!  (frustrated, muffled yelling, gagging)  Oh, just let him go.   (wheezy coughing)  (gasping)  Well, I actually don\'t have all night.   (breathing deeply)  (raspy voice): Cops  Cops took it.   (thud)     The cops took it.     (raspy voice): Yes.    Well, isn\'t that convenient?  (continues in raspy voice): No.  Actually, it\'s extremely inconvenient, because  Hang on.  (gulping)  (coughs, normal voice) Because then I have to come back here to Frankenstein\'s bullshit.   Common misconception.  Frankenstein was the doctor  and not the monster.   I would have gone with Pantagruel.   Oh, and the next time you put your hands on me,  you better kill me.   Oh, I think that goes without saying.     Look, her brother   Ugh!  shut up must\'ve brought the cops,  and then they double crossed him and stole the ransom.   So I chased them, but then Figgis shot out my tire, and    Figgis?   Yeah.  Him and Poovey, they  Tell me this doesn\'t have anything to do  with Trexler\'s missing whores.   Okay.  Although, come to think of it  If Figgis doesn\'t square things with Trexler,  he\'s walking around dead and just doesn\'t know it yet.   (gasps) Not unlike Frankenstein\'s monster!    Or you.    (clears throat)  And so, since you know where those bent coppers  are taking the money  go get it!  (sighs) Okay, but before that,  I haven\'t slept in, like, literally four days, so    (gasps) I have Dexedrine.    (sighs)    Gimme.    Oh, and here.  You should also take the codeine,  just in case you need to smooth down the jagged edges.   (inhales sharply) Although I\'m not sure which is which.   (sighs) I mean    FIGGIS: Are you crazy?   POOVEY: No.  Shut up.   Come on.  Listen.   Trexler doesn\'t know we have the money  So what? He knows I owe him the money!  Jesus, are you suicidal?  (chuckling) Me? Hell, no.   I\'ve got tons to live for.     ("Pomp and Circumstance" playing)   WOMAN (over P. A. ): Bai Poovey.   Chang Poovey.     Guong Poovey.    (Poovey sniffles, coughs)    (inhales sharply) Goddamn it.    Jiang Poovey.     I promised I wouldn\'t cry.  (sniffles)   Liling Poovey.   Well, promise broken! (sobs)    (blows nose loudly)   Peng Poovey.   Oh, Peng! Oh, he overcame dyslexia! (sobbing)    You, on the other hand   Wha What about me?  No, just, you know, you said "suicide. "  And?  (laughing) Oh, come on!  White? Divorced? Cop?  Access to a firearm? Cuckold?  (laughing) Statistically, you\'re already dead.   Well, I am if we don\'t take Trexler his money!  There were two cars chasing us in the park, remember?  For all we know, those were Trexler\'s guys!  Wha How?  Trexler didn\'t even know the drop was happening!    Well, then, who were they?   I don\'t know!  But whoever they were, betcha they\'re pissed.   (off kilter footsteps)  Throw me out of a goddamn car,  ya limp dick gumshoe son of a bitch!  New dress all shit housed.   New Delman heel somewhere in the goddamn idiot woods.   Got grass and goddamn dirt up my crack.   I swear to Christ, when I find your ass,  you\'re gonna wish I had died, because  (inhales, exhales deeply)  Ahem.   Can I help you?  I\'m commandeering this vehicle.   (laughs) You\'re what?  Commandeering this vehicle.   I\'m a a detective.  LAPD, so  Look, lady and here,  obviously, I\'m using the word "lady"  in the very broadest possible sense  I\'m sorry that prick Archer shoved you out of a moving car,    but I am in no mood for   (cocks gun)    Well, that, for one thing.    Let\'s go, toots.  I got places to be.   Okay.  A, the free clinic\'s not even open till 9:00  Oh, hardy har har.     And two   What the    Yeah.    Who the hell do you think you are?  Ohhh, shit.   Yeah.  "Oh, shit. "  Special Agent Lana Kane.   Um, uh, Trinette McGoon.   Nice to meet ya, Detective McGoon.     I\'m, uh, not really a cop.    No shit.   So, what are you, like, in the FBI?  No.  The FBI doesn\'t have any female agents.   They did have one Alaska P.  Davidson    but J.  Edna fired her.    "J.  Edna"?  Hoover.  And trust me,    history will not be kind to that man.    How come?  Well, besides his being a misogynistic,  anti Semitic, anti Catholic racist    Anti Catholic?   how do you feel about cross dressing?  Eh, I try not to judge people.   Well, then, you\'re in the minority.   Yeah, speaking of, uh  (sighs) FBI? Literally, maybe five Negro agents.   Actually, probably less    Fewer.    Shut up.  Since Marcus Garvey died.   So, no, I work in the Intelligence Unit    of the Internal Revenue Service.    (laughing)    What? The IRS has cops?   Yes!  (laughing) Doing what?    Uh, ever heard of Al Capone?   Seriously?  Well, he died in prison thanks to the IRS.   He died in prison thanks to tertiary neurosyphilis.   Well, okay, fine.  Um, uh (mutters)  Oh, oh, the Lindbergh kidnapping.  The IRS solved that.   Oh, yeah, I bet they were so happy to get their dead baby back.     Don\'t be a twat.    Fair enough.   ARCHER: I thought it was unfair  for Mother to blame me for the drop going tits up.   After all, she was supposed to be  helping me find Woodhouse\'s killer.   But so far, she\'s done nothing.  Right?  Hey, I said, "Right?" Oh, Jesus,  I thought I was talking to a tramp or a dog, or  Man, this Dexedrine really does have an edge.   Better take one of these codeines.   Although I\'m not sure which is which,  or what I\'ve actually been taking.   So  better take one of each.     (crunching)   Mm.  Well, or two, maybe.     (crunching)   Or three.     Three, and that\'s it.  Done.    (crunching)  (laughs) Okay, five.   So, what\'s wrong with this thing?  There\'s a bullet hole in the radiator.   Yeah, there is.     Eh, you got a raw potato?   Uh, no.     A raw egg?   No.     Black pepper?   No, Trinette\'s concussion!  (gasps) You think I got a concussion?  Maybe, with your crazy jibber jabber  about Spanish omelet ingredients!  Huh? Oh.  No, dummy.   Those are just jerry rigged ways to fix a leaky radiator.   Whaaat?  Throw a chunk of potato or some pepper in there, cap it.   The steam pressure shoves it in the hole and seals it up.   Same with an egg.  Ya crack it in, it cooks on the way to the hole.   Bull shit.   Aw, come on.  That\'s common knowledge.   It is absolutely not.   Why do you think it\'s called the "potato compartment"?  Why do I think the glove compartment  is called the "potato compartment"?    "Glove compartment"?   Is this some Irish bullshit?    Oh, now who\'s a racist?   Oh, for the  Even if I shoved an entire uncooked breakfast in there    Which you wouldn\'t wanna do.    all the water already leaked out.   Well, yeah, so you just piss in it.     I think we should split up.    What?  Yeah, you don\'t need me.   I\'m just slowing you down.  So, uh  Aw, come on.  Don\'t say that.   No, yeah, you should go.  Away.     Ya sure?   So very.   Well, okay, then.  I (sighs)  Guess I\'ll just ride with this mook.     (car approaching)   What the  Good evening, ladies.   (sighs) Why are you here, Mr.  Vandertunt?  In the hope the kidnappers left my bag behind.   It was a gift.   Well, you\'re out of luck.     And those cops you brought stole the money.    What? Those finks!  Yeah, that prick Archer said  one of \'em owed a bunch of money to Len Trexler.   Well, then, that\'s where we\'re going.   We\'re commandeering this vehicle.   Can obvious prostitutes do that?    I\'m not an obvious prostitute!   She\'s a T man, ya dummy.   Wow! I would not have guessed that.   Not a transvestite, a treasury agent!  And quit blabbing that around.  Bel Air Road.     Go!   Yes, sir!    "Ma\'am"!   Sorry! However you self identify!  Ugh! Will you calm down?  I just wanna get some hot water!  Well, you\'ll be in hot water if you try to sneak off  before Archer comes back with that ransom money.   I heard you! Tsk!  You make being kidnapped just awful.   There\'s a reason they say "kidnapping victim"    and not "kidnapping winner. "   (trapdoor opens)    KRIEGER: What\'s that?   (gasps)    (Zerk growls)   (screams)  Don\'t you have a house to haunt?  No.   And what is that? What do you have?  Um    Nothing.    (trapdoor closes)  (locks clicking)  I think it was something.   Boy, you don\'t miss a trick.   We\'ll see how funny you are hopping around on one foot.   (chuckling)  That actually does sound funny.  (chuckles)  LANA: And wait.  Weren\'t you wearing a polo uniform?    Did you go home and change?   I did, yes.   In all the excitement of the ransom drop, I evacuated.   Yeah, well, I would\'ve hightailed it too.   No, no, no, no.  Common misconception.   When a person evacuates,  it means they empty their bladder and bowels.     (both): Ew!   Well, I\'m sorry.  I didn\'t invent Latin.     Oh.  Ooh.  So what do you call this?   No.     What, the potato compart   No.     Spud box?   No!    Tater hutch.    Rrrrrgh!  I knew we\'d get there eventually.   Can we eventually get to Trexler\'s?  I mean, presumably.   Ugh! I swear to God  FIGGIS: Poovey, if you don\'t shut up  POOVEY: No, you shut up! Come on! Wait!  It\'s not too late to turn back.   Yes.  It is.   And why the hell are you so desperate for money?  Because you know how much it\'s gonna cost  to send a kid to Stanford in 1967?  I know if you don\'t shut up,  you won\'t have to worry about it,  because I\'m gonna shoot you in the genitals!  Huh.  Now, why would the door be open?  Maybe he\'s got a selfish partner  who left the door open on purpose  so his new puppy could get run over by a car.   Oh, and the puppy\'s name is Dreams!    (cocks gun)   Oh, go ahead.     Blow it off!   (shushing)  (quietly): Something\'s not right, you idiot.     (whispers): Oh.    (cocks gun)  CECIL: So, Trinette, as a prostitute,  how do you feel about role playing    Whatever fluffs your feathers.    Please let me finish.   Where the story revolves around merkins,  mistaken identities, and incest.     (both): Ew!   And it\'s a musical.   No, you lumpy little pervert!    What happened to not judging people?   There\'s a limit.   Well, yes, of course.   That\'s why we would have a safe word  (spooky voice): that only I would know!  You\'re (bleep) weird.   (evil chuckling)  (Archer chuckling)  (laughs)  Oh, man.  Never gets old.   I don\'t wanna sound greedy, but maybe, if I\'m lucky,  I can get the money and get Figgis murdered.   Whoa.  I  I may have over smoothed.   Yeah, definitely a little too smooth, because  Hang on.  Did I just open that?  No, dummy.  You just got here.  Hey!  Come on, Archer.  Get your shit together.   Door wide open, none of Trexler\'s goons around?  Something smells fishy.     But also (sniffing)   (cocks gun)  kind of like cuy.   I know.  It sounds disgusting,  but trust me, it is utterly delicious.     (spooky voice): And taboo!   Jesus Christ!  Your family tree must look like a telephone pole.   Ugh! Seriously.   Okay.  There\'s Archer\'s car, the cops  Park behind them.   And both of you wait here.   With pleasure.   I\'m not staying out here with him.   (sighs) Okay.  Trinette, come with me.  You stay here.     But   No "buts!" Except yours, in that seat!    Those   I know! They\'re homophones!    Now sit!   Oh, all right.   I suppose I could use this time to constantly honk the horn.   (groans)    Oh, my God! This place is amazing!   (chuckles)  Sorry.  I\'m just extremely wealthy.   And loud.  Now, shut up and  Oh, wait a minute.  Why would the door be open?  (quietly): Was that rhetorical?  No.  Now come on.   Because it could\'ve been left open for any number of reasons.   (spooky voice): Only some of which are sinister.   You are so lucky I don\'t have a silencer.   I\'m also just lucky in general.     (distant running footsteps)   (all gasp)  (all breathing heavily)    Did you hear that?   Obviously.   Do you think it was one of Trexler\'s goons?  Oh, boy, I hope so.  You know, as opposed to a ghost.   There\'s just so few of them who are friendly.     I mean, basically you got   (distant running footsteps)  Casper?    (squelching footstep)   What the  (clicks)  (groans)  Was that a lighter? Can we smoke?  Shut up! And no!    It\'s medicinal.    (distant running footsteps)    Ooh, gimme.    Shh!    Stay here.    (lighter clicks)  (inhaling)  (muffled): Mm kay.   (sighs) Before this is over,  please, don\'t be surprised if I shoot you.     Mm kay.    (squelching footstep)  What the Holy shit!  (sniffing) Is that  (sniffing) marijuana?  (chuckling) Oh, come on.  Give it a rest.     Give what a rest?   Oh, my God.  Look,  how or why you did it, I don\'t know, and I don\'t care,  but I know burnt pubes when I smell \'em!  First of all, I Wait.   Why do you know what burnt pubes smell like?  Because I grew up on a farm.     (squelching footstep)   Oh! Son of a    What was that?   Hold this.   Gonna do your armpits?  Huh.   That\'s not very Casper y.   Do Do you think it\'s Trexler\'s?  (snickers) Oh, please! With your luck?  Oh, sweet mother of Christ!  Wh What the hell is happening?    And why the hell are you here?   That\'s it?  No "Sorry I shoved you out of a moving frickin\' car"?  I said sorry in advance.  And what are you doing here?    And, follow up, why do you have a gun?   Uh    Because, you dick, she\'s a   Trinette!    She means "transvestite. "   I\'m    What?   I am not a  Is that why your hands are so big?  I\'m not a transvestite, you idiot!  For the We had sex!    Ooh.    Yeah, but I wasn\'t down there.     Oh, I know.    No, like down there down there.   Believe me, I know.     Well, that\'s not very Casper y.    Poovey!    Aha!   Where\'s the money?  And the bag that contains it.   I don\'t know.   Well, then, I guess I\'ll be on my way.     Really?   No!   Aw.   Figgis, get your ass out here!  FIGGIS: No.  I\'m protecting the ransom money.   (chuckling) From what? All these witnesses?  (sighs) Can\'t have anything nice.     (chuckles) Certainly not clothes.    Stuff it, shamus.   (clears throat) Mr.  Vandertunt!  You\'ll be happy to know we recovered the ransom money.     So   Well, the main thing is the bag, bud.   But, unfortunately,  all of this has to be entered into evidence    Where anything can happen to it.    Oh, right.     So, can we   No, no, no, no.   First I need to count it to make sure you didn\'t steal any.   On what possible legal grounds?  Uh, uh, citizen\'s arrest?    Not a real thing.    You wanna bet?    (cocks gun)   Do you?    Kind of.    Can we    Poovey.    Huh? Oh.     Lana, you wanna   I wanna talk about the fact  that we\'re standing in a cranberry bog of blood!  (overlapping chatter)  Well, it is a full moon, so  It\'s actually a waxing gibbous.   Oh.  Then never mind.     Were you gonna say a werewolf?   No.     (Trexler wailing)   (all gasp, exclaim)    Or was I?   TREXLER: Help!    Holy shit!   That\'s Trexler!  It came from this way.  Come on.     Figgis, you lead the way.  Go.    (overlapping chatter)    TREXLER: Help!   (chuckling): I I hate to say this,  but I almost kind of hope there\'s a werewolf.   Not even as a joke!  (exclaiming in disgust)  Jesus Christ!  (Trexler sobbing)  (sobbing): Oh, please, help me.   I think I would\'ve preferred werewolf.   Who Who did this to you?  (sobbing continues)  (chuckling)  What\'s happening, gang?1 (dramatic music)  So, uh, what\'re we  How the hell are you walking around?  I\'m sorry.  Should I not be? (chuckles)  (chuckles) Are you Wait, are you kidding, or  Archer! Archer, you shut your mouth!    Because seriously, if you\'re not   Archer!  You need to go rustle up a dime and call Robert Goddamn Ripley.   Wait a minute!

(gunshots)    Oww!   What\'d ya, eat a buncha magnets?  Seriously.   Doing the same thing over and over  and expecting a different result.     (Figgis whimpers)   Oh, for That\'s the ransom money!

But, uh, get me out of here alive, and the ransom money, we\'ll call it even, okay?    Uh, we\'re way more than even.    Wh? How do you figure?  Because your final thought on this earth wasn\'t about how my gun tasted.   Fair enough.   Right.  Okay, how\'s my face look?  It\'s good.  How\'s it feel?    Hmm.  Honestly, not that bad.    What\'s that, codeine?  Yeah, mixed with some dexedrine.   (chuckling) "The Adventures of Dex and Cody. "  Let me ask you, should you be doing that?  (mocking voice) "Should you be doing that?"  Actually no, probably not.   Come on, move it! What\'re you, hourly?  I mean  Is it just me, or is it cold?    It\'s you.    Well, your shock.   Just checking.   He needs a hospital!    No shit.

Can you hotwire it?  Why\'re you asking me?  Because you know all that shit  about putting breakfast in the radiator!    What?   For a leak.  Potatoes, an egg  That\'s pretty common knowledge.     No, it\'s not.    Also pepper.     Can you hotwire it?   No.   CYRIL: Nobody can.   Because it\'s English and it\'s stupid,  with a bunch of stupid English wires.   (annoyed sigh)  (annoyed sigh)  I don\'t have time for this shit!  Not if that crazy Kraut was on the level about that Factor K shit.   And also I\'ve lost track of time!  (crash)    What was that?   (crash)  Sounds like somebody\'s smashing up all your shit.   With a halberd.   BARRY: Woooooooo!  Yeah.  Can\'t have anything nice.     That halberd was pretty nice.    (crash)  Yeah, was.  And why are we going up?  (grunts)    Something\'s not right.    CHERYL: I\'ll say.   I didn\'t think it was possible, but somehow being kidnapped  is even more boring than my mother\'s funeral.   I meant with Archer and the ransom!    Still, though.    Mr.  Zerk.   Rgh?  If the wheels end up coming off this thing,  obviously I\'ll need you to tie up  all the remaining loose ends.   (sighs)  (blows raspberry)  I wonder what could\'ve gone wrong.   (grunts)  Son of a bitch.   Is the parking brake off?    Oh.    Goddammit.     Sorry.    Will you hurry up?

That crazy robot was just about to finger you  for stealing Trexler\'s whores!    Wait, what?   Finger who? Ow!  That was Archer! What the hell would I want with a buncha Chinese broads?  (long inhale)  (long exhale)  (sniffles) Okay, okay.   Jeez.  Knock it off!  Maybe they got us some new diapers.   (gurgles)  (inhales, sighs)  Ya know?  I wasn\'t implying you kept them.   Wait, hang on, did you  Are we gonna stand here all night yanking our goddamn    genitals?   Yes, where did we land on that?    Ugh!   Hey, my keys!  I mean  Right? What are the odds?  Because, asshole, if we hadn\'t gone upstairs  we wouldn\'t be whatever!    Shinnying.    Exactly!  Exactly.  And this is the last place    he\'d ever think to look for us, so   BARRY: Hey, guys!

Okay, jeez, I\'m going!  (imitates Marx): Guess I better not stall.   (weak laugh)  Uh, this is a cigar.   Go!  And since Archer was kind enough  to leave his keys in the ignition get in!    Umm   We\'ll just take my car.   No, actually, you\'ll come with me!    To where?   What? My headquarters!  What, like some drag club?  For the I\'m not a transvestite!  I\'m a treasury agent!  BOTH: What?  And you two are under arrest.   BOTH: What?  Kidnapping, conspiracy to commit kidnapping,  grand larceny oh, and while we\'re on the subject,  I\'ll go ahead and take the ransom money.

Interrupting cow.   Interrupting cow  Typical! Typical! Typical! Typical! Typical!  What could possibly  have been typical about that?    Me! I always do shit like this!   Like what?  All I wanted to do was find out who killed my partner Woodhouse,  and the next thing I know I\'ve disappeared up my own asshole  and I\'m manumitting sex slaves and grossly abusing corpses  and trying to source a finger for some weird psychosexual kidnapping,  and then, to top off all the bullshit,  getting chased by goddamn robots!  I mean, (bleep) halberds,  Jesus Christ.   Wait, wait, wait, what was that?    Halberds!   No, no, no, no, did you  You said your partner\'s name was Woodhouse?  Yeah, why?  Woodhouse, the dope fiend detective.   What You Yes! Why?  Because, and I\'m sorry kid, I don\'t know how to break this to you, but  But what?  Mother killed Woodhouse.

Well, not, you know,  not her personally,  it was probably that golem of hers.   (low, contented rumbling)    MOTHER: Mr.  Zerk.    (growl)  It\'s obvious that Archer\'s  bungled this whole thing,  which means we need to do a little housekeeping.     Rgh?   Mm hmm.   And don\'t bring back a dirty shovel.   Rrrgh  (big yawn)  Oh, my God, if someone doesn\'t bring me toast  I will literally die.   ARCHER: And how do you know about this?  Oh, come on, everybody knows.   Your partner got in too deep on his dope bill,  so she had that ape whack him.   If I find out you\'re lying to me  Why would I lie?  That bitch  (chuckling) Well, you know what they say,  you lie down with dogs, you wake up with fl    (breaks squeal)   POOVEY: Jesus!  LANA: What! What\'s the big idea?  The big idea is  we\'re going to Dreamland,  and you\'re all gonna stay tied up  until I find out the truth.   Who keeps this much rope in their trunk?  Besides rapists?  Uh, mountain climbers?  Yeah, climbing up to their mountaintop rape shed.     Their what?   How would that even work?

(terrified whimper/sob)    And I\'d do it sooner rather than   (opens the door)  (scream, cut short by impact sound)  (chuckling) Later!       Double double, toil and trouble  Although if I\'m being honest,  it\'s really no trouble.  I love my work.   Not as much as you do, obviously.   Alright, once my patient arrives    (door creaks)   Well, speak of the devil.   I was just Oh, damn it, what do you want?  Rrrrgh!  What?    Rgh.    (annoyed sigh)    Well, don\'t bring it back dirty.    Rrgh!    Because it ruins it.   ARCHER: Now sit down!  Come on, I don\'t have all goddamn day!  I mean I do, but  (through sock): Mm mmmf! Mmf mmfff mmf!    What?   (in agreement): Mmff! Mmf mmf! Rrmmfmf!  I can\'t understand a word you\'re saying.   Mm mmmf! Mmf mmfff mmf!  Oh, my God.     What?   Pfft, pfft.   I don\'t know, I didn\'t really have anything, I was just    Mmf mmmf!   Mmf mmmf!  (groans)    Pfft, pfft! Ptuh! Pbbb!   There! Happy?  MOTHER: What the hell  is going on here?    Aha!   Aha what?  Aha, um, hang on  Trexler? Why the hell are you here?    I   Aha! Okay, I got it now.  Sit down.   I beg your pardon?  Sit down!  Well, somebody likes to chew his cabbage twice    Both of you!   All right!  Rudolph the Rude nosed Reindeer  Now then, would you mind telling me  what it is you think you\'re doing?  I think it might be some kinda Hercule Poirot type deal,  where he gathers everybody in the parlor.     Have you lost your mind?   (chewing pills)  Actually maybe, I dunno, I haven\'t slept in like a week  and I\'ve been eating dexedrine like candy, so  (gasps) Are you seeing tracers yet?    I no, shut up.    What is this all about?  It\'s about you, killing my partner!  What? Who told you that?    Trexler!   Wh Trexler, you dirty liar!  Well, now, technically I said your goon killed him, but  We had nothing to do with it!  Oh, and I\'m just supposed to take your word?    You took his!   Well?    Why would I have him killed?   Because he owed you money!  Okay, well think about that statement.     Strangely illogical.    Yeah.   It\'s not like he was walking around  with the money in his belly.   Then why\'d you send me down to Long Beach  the night my office was robbed?    Burgled.    Whatevered!    To spy on Trexler! We\'re competitors!   I  Which is why, you idiot, he\'s trying    to frame me for killing your partner!   TREXLER: (gasps)  Slander!    Sue me!   I got a half a mind to!    You\'ve got half a mind, period.    And all the burns.   And if I could, I\'d sue you  for hijacking my truckload of whores!    That wasn\'t me, either!   Yeah, Poovey took \'em.     Godddammit.    What?    Yeah, what?   Oh, don\'t play dumb, Figgis!  I\'m not! I had no idea!    Or did he?   Oh, you son of a bitch!  Why ya throwin\' me under the bus?  I am gonna go buy a bus, and literally throw you under it,  and then drive it back and forth on your face!  See? Spoken like a true killer!  Oh, like you\'re one to talk! I got three men in the morgue!  (chuckling) Again, that was Poovey.     What?   Goddammit!   I mean  POOVEY: Well, some people need to get shot!    Case in point!   Rrgh?  (explosion, startled reactions to the noise)  (panting) Whoo! Hey, gang!  (chuckling) What\'s happening?    (reactions to Dutch\'s being here)   Are you kidding me?  How are you here?  Commandeered a vehicle.   I mean how are you still alive?  I dunno, I guess just clean livin\'!  A and how did you know we were here?  I didn\'t! No, no, this is just  an almost unbelievable coincidence.   No, I\'m actually just here for my blue stuff.     Your what?   Um  So this is a little awkward.     But he\'s actually my patient.    (confused reactions)    I don\'t care what he is   He\'s a goddamn robot!    Actually   Nobody smashes up my club!    (whistles)   (groans)  Mr.  Zerk!  Grrrrghh  (chuckling) Okay, but we gotta  make this quick  Rarrrghh!    (groans)   (startled/impressed reactions)  \'cause I\'m about a quart low.   A quart low on what?  This! He has to have it to live!  Yeah, so come on, Doc, fill \'er up.   Will somebody Archer, shoot him!    What? No, he\'s my life\'s work!   Yeah.   Plus it doesn\'t do any good.  Look.     Owww!   (Archer and Dutch chuckle)  Dammit, Archer! You did that on purpose!    Come on.    POOVEY: Seriously?    What\'re you doing?   Gettin\' the hell outta here.     Wh? No, you\'re not!   Well, ya say that  Come on, man, jam it in there  so I can start killing these shitheads.   (angry/fearful reactions)  What? No, no, that\'s not what I    Jam it!   No!  I won\'t have you become  just another mindless killing machine!  How, could you possibly think you\'re the boss of me?  I\'ll show ya who\'s boss!    (groans)   How ya like that?    Meh.    Well, then how about this!    Oof!   DUTCH: Woooooo!  Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on  I\'m going as fast as I can!    What about me?   What about you?  Get me outta here alive, all right?  And the ransom money,    we\'ll call it even.    Yeah.   That\'s what you told Archer.  And look what good it did him!    Wait, wait, wait, wait   Rrrraagghhh!  Ungh! Oh, my God, that really hurt.   (chuckling) Look at you, whining like your little buddy.   My what?  Yeah.  The little limey dope fiend.   When I gut shot him and left him for dead.     What?   (murmured reactions)  Aha! Probably on Trexler\'s orders!  What, no! I didn\'t  He didn\'t tell me to do it.   Ow.   I did it just to see his light go out.   Goddamn.   Rrrraaaagh!  Ungh!  (chuckling)  Plus he cut me off in traffic.   You Rrrnnnngh!    I\'m sorry, what was that?   Grrnk!  I couldn\'t hear you over the sound of your Adam\'s apple  grinding against your spine.     Grrnk   No, still nothin\'.   Hurry up!  Jesus, you people would stand  in a bread line and ask for toast.   Wait, there\'s toast?    What?   Why would there be toast?    Why wouldn\'t there be?   KRIEGER: Stop it!  Stop it! Don\'t you see? You\'re better than this!  You don\'t have to be a killer!  You can use your power for the good of all mankind!  Yeah, I could.   But I was a murderer before you turned me into a freak,  so, I don\'t know why you thought    this was gonna have a happy ending.    But  Now go make me some blue stuff!  Ngh!  Is is that your final answer?    (gagging)   Not if I have to come over there.   (sighs) Well, I\'m very sorry to hear that.   Aktion!  (dogs barking and growling)    Oh, God!   What is that?  What what is that?  Sweet mother of God!  (panicked reactions)  Wait, what is this?    (screams)   (dogs snarling)  Rrnk! Goddamn rrnk!  (dogs snarling and gnashing)  Ugh.  Now I don\'t even know if I want toast.   Aaghhh! No, no, no! Wait, wait, wait! Stop it! No!  (chuckling) Holy shit.  Glad I don\'t have a flashback for that.   Down! Down! Down! Goddammit, do these muttz even speak Engl    God!   Jesus Christ!  (sniffs) Achtung! Hunden! Aus! Aus!    Krieger?   I don\'t Hunden! Aus!  Oh, for the Rrrrgh!  (startled yips)  (low menacing growls)  (tiny whispered terrified reactions)  Why on earth would you do that?  They were ruining toast!  (low menacing growls)  Somebody do something.   (weary sigh) Well, I already threw a chair, so  Then you go do something!  (startled yelp) Archer, shoot them!  No! They\'re all I have left!    (cat meows)   You don\'t count!  Rrrrghh!  (barking and growling)  Rrrrrrghh!  Aus! Aus!    Rrrghh! Grrghh!   (snarling and gnashing)  (assorted reactions to the fight)  (chuckling) Man, I don\'t know who to root against.   They saved your life!  Still though.   (horrified reactions)  Nooooo!    Rrrghh! Grrghh!   (dog snarling and gnashing)  (horrified reactions)  Rrgh.   (a wail, followed by sobbing)  (crying) You, you saved my life!  Rrgh  And was it Was it because you love me?    Rrrgh.    Oh, my God.   That is without a doubt,    the saddest thing I have ever heard.    Rgh?  I mean, in what kind of crazy dream world  could we ever possibly be together?  (Archer chuckling)  Jesus Christ.     Should\'ve shot her when I had the chance.    Okay, well,  everything seems under control here, so we\'ll just, um  Uh, where do you think you\'re going?    Yeah.  With my money!   With my money!  Well, thanks a lot, T man!    What?   Drop the bag.   What did you call her?    T man   Oh, hey, uh    But but it\'s not what you think   Hey!    It it means Treasury agent   Hey!  Oh.  Although right about now I\'m guessing she wishes it didn\'t.     Son of a   Treasury agent?    Look   No, you look!  (tense/wary reactions)  Hey, be careful, it\'s got a    Zip it!   I    I can explain!   Yes.   Please explain what you\'ve been doing  in my bar for the past year.   Because either you were moonlighting as a singer  just to make ends meet on a government salary,  or you were working undercover to bring me down!  Or both! Dun dun dun!  Not helping! But if I were undercover,  obviously my agency would be in the know,  and so if anything happened to me, you\'d  (gunshot)    (groans)   Lana! What the shit, Mother?  I, I didn\'t mean to! This damn thing\'s got a hair trigger!    That\'s what I was trying to tell you!   When?  Before!  Hair trigger my ass, gimme that!  (gunshot) Oh, shit!    (groans)   Lana!  Man, that is a hair trigger.   Goddammit, Poovey!  How was that my fault?    La Lana!   Archer?  Shhh.  You\'re gonna be okay.   Somebody call an ambulance!  Ugh.  I already threw a chair.   Archer  I\'m sorry.   Why why why are you sorry?  I got blood on you.   Well, I blew a load on your dress, so    (gunshot) Ungh!   Poovey!  I\'m sorry! I (gunshot)    (startled/annoyed reactions)   Poovey!  Goddammit! I (gunshot)    Drop the goddamn gun!   Okay! (gunshot)  (angry reactions)  (long, weary sigh)  (scared whisper) Is she    Yes!   (big exhale) Whew!    What?   What? I was asking if she\'s okay.   (irritated reactions)  No, Poovey, she is the exact opposite of okay! She\'s dead!  Because she got shot seven times  and nobody could possibly survive that!  Not even in a parallel universe!  What the hell are you looking at?  No, just Okay, so she\'s dead.   Yes! She\'s dead! Forever and ever!  On infinite (bleep) earths!  (speaks German)  Shut up! And gimme that!    Poovey, I\'m giving you half.    Of the money?    Wait a minute!   Are you nuts?  But you have to promise to set  those Chinese ladies up in business.   Oh, my God, I\'ve got so many ideas!  Whoa, whoa, whoa,  who says you get to decide who gets the money?  John Moses Browning.   Well, news flash, Mister Tough and Smart Guy,  you\'re out of ammo!  Wh Get him!  Duh huh.   (weary sigh) Goddammit.     What?   What is it?  There\'s no money.   Just these weird German nudie mags about sports and  implied incest.   CECIL: There\'s no incest!  They\'re all just really happy to be together,    and outside, and   TRINETTE: Naked.   Well, and healthy.  As a family.   Whatever.  Now is not the time.   Oh, right.  Sorry, Father.  Please continue.   (clears throat) And do you, Cecil,  take Trinette to be your lawfully wedded wife?  Mmmmmm  Ow! I do!  (weary sigh)  So, I guess I\'ll see you around.   And so that\'s pretty much that, I guess.  Vengeance wise.   And I, I don\'t know if you feel avenged,  or if that even matters to you.   Tell you what I do know, is robot dogs? Jesus Christ.   And I know the case took a long time, but like you always said,  I have a tendency to get sidetracked.   Which, honestly, was kinda shitty of you.   And the smart thing would\'ve been to read your envelope  full of clues and then start rampaging, but holy shit,  I wonder if that was your will.   Although I can\'t imagine you having anything  that I would possibly want.   I mean, I\'ll swing by your apartment  and take a look around, but uh  What else, what else? Oh, I brought you some heroin.   Hopefully some kids won\'t walk by and eat it.   Oh, and also, uh, a rock.   I didn\'t know if you were Jewish.   We never talked about that.   I guess mainly because you were so weirdly private.   But even so, Woodhouse.   Oh, I\'m gonna miss the shit outta you.   (deep sigh) All right, I\'ll see ya.   I dunno, next week, or  uh, you know what, let\'s play it by ear.   What the Hello?  Hello?  Hey, where the hell are you guys?  Hello? Hello? Wait, what\'s this?  (low mumbling)  (explosive sob)'
